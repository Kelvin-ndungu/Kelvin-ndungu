              "'BEST ALL AROUND PURPOSE CROSSOVER SUV I have never seen or driven a car like this before.  I\\'ve owned BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, Porsche 911, and Mercedes SL 55 and a Honda Pilot.  The SQ5  is a combination of all of them.  Its rides very comfortably, very stable, and quiet, sporty and with a lot of power and torque. Its a get up and go car, great to drive anywhere in the city or country.  I love the quality and the very advanced technology I feel like I\\'m in a spaceship.  I\\'ve tested the Volvo XC90, it had a very bouncy air suspension and I didn\\'t quite trust their NAV system. I also test drove the RX 350, but again the ride was not as smooth and it just didn\\'t absorb the bumps well, plus it was quite boring to drive. I\\'ve never test drove an Audi before until my wife wanted to look at the Audi Q7. After we bought the Q7, I just fell in love with it and had to have one just like it.  The SQ5 is a combination of sports car and comfortable SUV, very adaptable to all my different driving needs. Best car This is a wonderful car.  The technology is very adaptable the car most comfortable and is great looking. Many nice details. Waiting to see gas mileage Great Buy Do your home work Fun Car Great ride. Loaded with technology. Steering not as tight as x5 Best luxury SUV w/ perfect comfort/sport balance Very happy with choosing the 2018 Audi SQ5 prestige. Before buying, I compared it to the new F -Pace S, XC60 T8, 43 AMG, and upcoming redesigned  X3 M40i. With Audi SQ5\\'s standard adaptive dampers, you get the best comfort, but also great sportiness when desired. The volvo is for my taste too soft and floaty, while the others are too harsh for a daily driver even with adaptive dampers. Even when driving back-to-back the Lexus RX and the SQ5 on my backroads, I found the SQ5 quieter and soaking up bumps much better than the Lexus RX while being faster at the same time. The virtual cockpit and the modern entertainment system are truly the best and most updated in their class, ahead of other competitors. Having google maps in a 12.3\" screen in front of you w/ live traffic info is unbeatable. The XC 60 T8 comes close, but its infotainment system is rather laggy and ergonomics are not well though-out as everything, incl. heater, are adjusted w/ the main screen. So if that main screen does not boot up quickly or correctly you are basically left in the dark not being able to adjust anything. As confirmed by the recent reliability survey from consumer-reports, Audis are very reliable particularly compared to other luxury brands. Volvo and Jag are the bottom brands in this respect. All in all, it is the best grocery getter I have owned that pertains a dual-personality of keeping the rest of the family comfortable driving from A to B, but yet having the option of embracing windy and twisty roads with speed. Great car!!! Still new. Everything seems working perfectly.. won’t know of any problems until a few years later. Will give an update in a year or so. Exceptionally balanced vehicle Ive owned alot of cars since the late 70\\'s, mostly BMW and Porsche. Ive owned 5 M3\\'s, 2 M5\\'s, 4 911\\'s and more recently X5\\'s, a Cayenne and even an X3M. Then I bought a 2012 Audi A8L and fell in love with the brand. Bought wife an Audi allroad and wanted something a little sportier. Wen to the dealer intending to look at the S4/S6/7 line and was considering the S5 sportback. All of the aforementioned is only for context. Im an older guy who appreciates performance and yet I have a perspective of how much performance a person can actually use on the street. I also enjoy a modicum of practicality and so many new cars today offer both that could only be dreamed of 10 or 15 years ago. The SQ5 is without a doubt the best balance of both comfort and performance I have encountered to date in an easy to live with package. Simply amazing the choices we consumers enjoy today. I considered a Macan but the usual Porsche buying experience is a turnoff. Additionally, my local Audi dealer was terrific to deal with and frankly, the SQ5 technology embarrases the Macan as well as the driving dynamics of the 2018 SQ5 feel far superior to the older platform that underpins the Macan. You can\\'t go wrong with the SQ5 and be sure to get the virtual cockpit option. A rare find! I have owned a 2006 BMW X5, 4.4V8, 2009 Mercedes ML350, 3.5V6, and now this supercharged German beast! I have driven over 4000 mi. in about 6 weeks mainly urban commuting. The SQ5 by far has outshined my previous makes and models in almost every aspects, from interior quality, to performance, agility, steering precision, and nimbleness in maneuvering. I truly enjoy this new found, near instant acceleration, very useful in overtaking slow-pokes on Houston freeways, and ingressing from ramps to freeways. Also the braking is quite impressive too with its massive front rotors and pads.  Interior fit and finish oozes quality, and attention to detail, from knurled knobs to beautifully contoured dash and center console, and a smooth metal and leather round gearshift knob. All controls are quite logical. However adjusting the fan speed is a two step process, and speaker volume control not in its usual location. Lack of USB port makes up by having WIFI & media bluetooth connection, and two SD card slots. I just copied my entire music collection on one SD slot, all at my fingertips. Though the front seats are beautifully made, they are narrow for the north american ass. I am just over 200lbs, but wish the seats were a bit wider for drives longer than an hour. The view out the front, sides, and up is great, except for the massive blindspots from the two side view mirrors. Not exactly \"Mickey Mouse ears\" mirrors, they still block your view of the curb you are turning into. Very careful, not to hit the curb with those awesome 21\" wheels. I truly enjoy driving the SQ5, every chance I get. It sure feels like a refreshing change from  the Merc, and the BMW, which seem to have become such mainstream, with the soccer moms. The styling, lines, curves are mild, understated, unlike the crazy and faddish Japanese exterior designs lately. I am hoping the SQ5 will be as durable as well it performs. What a Cayenne Turbo driver thinks of this car This will surprise you. Forget the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. The only real competitor to the SQ5 is the Macan S. If you\\'ve had fun in your previous car, expect twice as much in the SQ5. The supercharged engine is far superior to any turbo. The power is instant and gratifying, complemented with the best engine tune in class. The transmission is composed and civilized in traffic and fast during spirited driving. The SQ5 beats its competitors hands down on gratification. If you like a softer ride, go with the 20\" wheels on the SQ5 or a Macan with air suspension. The X3 and GLC suspension can also be dialed down into comfort but those two will never escape their mommy wagon stigma. The other area where the SQ5 outshines all its competitors is practicality: much more interior space than the Macan, much bigger windows than the Merc and BMW, much better sound insulation (laminated windows standard) and much better access through rear doors than the Macan. The flat-bottom steering wheel is great for getting in and out, especially for bigger people. The SQ5 is not perfect: its only USB port is located in the passenger glove box and its adaptive cruise control does not go all the way to stop. But it stands for Stealth Wealth - people who want to drive the best without spilling the beans. I still can\\'t believe the sleeper status of this car. If you can find one, get one with optional diamond stitching inside! This car looks best in Daytona Gray and Sepang Blue. Hold On Punch the gas and hold on, this baby will fly.  Unfortunately flying takes lots of fuel.  On the plus I can cruise at 80 at 2,000 rpm.  Love the trim and tech features.  Does anyone really use the paddles? Audi 2017 SQ5 Quattro Blows Past Porsche Macan If you love performance, yet want something excellent in the snow  - this is your car... Sq5 2015 Sq5 2015 Is awesome. S4 in a bigger body Very fun car to drive. I\\'ve had 2 S4s (2012 and 2014) and now own a 2016 SQ5 and couldn\\'t be happier. The next Q5\\'s are going to be made in Mexico. What a dissapointment If interested, you may want to read my reviews on the 2002 Audi S8 (massive engine failure despite excellent service history), 2014 Q5 TDI (Expensive Vibrator).  I also have a 2008 S5 Coupe (so far, so good but it\\'s going soon).  So, this review is not in a vacuum, but with some real Audi ownership experience.  OK, cut to the chase - in Florida Lemon Law circus at present.  It was disappointing with delivery of the car.  The interior is made as cheaply as possible and it shows.  This is not the el cheapo standard seating.  Buzzers going off, alarms going off all the time.  Sport Utility Vehicle.  Well, utility is a joke.  Doors lock when you don\\'t want them to, alarms and warnings going off.  Between Health & Safety and the accountants, the car is pathetic.  Can\\'t even turn the radio off without shutting off the Navigation.   These are but annoyances really.  The real joy began on a long road trip, right after the 5,000 mile service.  About 300 miles into the trip the add oil light came on.  Pulled off into a service station and could not find the oil dip stick.  Called the dealer (Reeves of Tampa, of whom I\\'ve been dealing with with the other Audi\\'s and Porsche and think highly of) and informed that they don\\'t have dip sticks.  Well, the upshot of the trip was that I would add maybe 1/3 of a quart every 500 miles.  The day I got home I brought it in and they had it for about a week, said it was fixed and within 110 miles it was telling me to add oil again.  They then had it for two weeks (Total 15 days for Lemon Law) and again the light came on.  Now the purpose of the car is my commute to work, from Tampa, FL to outside New Orleans, LA.  I can\\'t be late looking for Audi dealers to see if I really need oil or not.  So, I then started the Lemon Law process.  Audi had 10 days to respond, but took 14 days.  I took the car back to Reeve for the final repair attempt.  They are allowed 10 days, but took 15 days.  I was told it was fixed, but the lights are on again.  The Better Business Bureau that one must go through stated today that Audi considers the car fixed.  Funny, I just took it to the dealer again today to have them manually check the oil before my next road trip.I\\'m totally disgusted with Audi Engineering (which seems to be run by accounting these days) and their customer support.  I have not ever had anyone from Audi give a courtesy call and sincerely state that they are sorry for my situation.  Rather, they just basically ignore the timelines set forth by the State of Florida.  Now whether that is due to arrogance, incompetence or being understaffed (due to more accountant management) I can\\'t say, but it is not very impressive what ever the case is.  I requested that this be resolved by 23 December as I have to travel for business again, but that request was not acknowledged.\"Truth in Engineering\"???  maybe they should revise to \"Truth is, it\\'s Value Engineering\".  Just a suggestion....Update.  While waiting for the arbitration hearing I took it in for the 15,000 mile service with the agreement that there would be no tampering or repair attempts.  After the service the yellow oil idiot light does not come on.  Fixed, well, not exactly.  I took it to another mechanic, had him drain about 2 qts of oil out and that yellow oil light still won\\'t come on, and the computer screen is now different.  Hmmm, change the oil and these things magically change as well.  I\\'m letting the Federal Trade Commission & FL Attorney General\\'s Office figure that out.  The complaint is under Unfair & Deceptive Business Practices. Finally had the Florida Arbitration Hearing, they ruled in my favor (3-0) but the law is so lame that the settlement was not acceptable to me.  Again attempted to settle this with Audi & Reeves Tampa Audi to no avail.  Now waiting for a court date under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Nearly one year sense the problem started.**Update**  One week prior to the pre trial hearing we went to mediation.  Volkswagen decided after a very brief negotiation to give me essentially what I had been asking for for over a year and pay my attorney\\'s fees as well, and of course that the poorly engineered and overpriced piece of junk (my opinion) back.  I am actually getting rid of my other Audi, an S5 coupe this week.  I want nothing to do with Volkswagen or the local dealership (Reeves Audi of Tampa) in the future due to the way I\\'ve been treated.  I have been a gentleman through this entire process, but was bullied, lied to and had the dealership play games which have been reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Attorney General\\'s office for unfair & deceptive business practices.  Used that dealership for 15 years with Porsche & Audi.  No more!Just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing more to add, other than I can\\'t imagine myself ever purchasing another product under VW.Again, I just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing to edit SQ5 Great Drive But The 2015 SQ5 has a great drive!  But the MMI system is the pits.  Too many buttons, levers, dials, etc. to search for and too many actions with them before what you want to happen does happen and too much time looking away from the road while searching for what you want.  But it is fun to drive, good size, fairly comfortable, too expensive, visibility not the best, and, considering cost,  behind somewhat in technology. Loving My First Audi Purchased my very first Audi in May 2016...new SQ5!  Had been shopping around for Audi Q3 and also Porsche Macan S.  Test drove the SQ5 one day and new this was the Audi for me.  The performance for a mid-size CUV is impressive.  Great acceleration and stopping power for a performance vehicle.  The quality of craftsmanship/materials is outstanding.  Love the interior design and seats...very comfortable and have great support. The carbon-fiber trim and matte chrome trim in the dash and doors add a very nice and elegant touch.  Love the Google maps feature and wifi hotspot feature.  The Bang and Oulfsen sound system is first rate in a vehicle in this price category.  While many have complained of no USB ports, this can be easily remedied by the USB plug adapter which so far has worked just fine.  Overall I\\'m very impressed and pleased with the Audi SQ5.  I smile every time I get behind the wheel.  I\\'m definitely an Audi fan! SQ5 Dream machine First of all Edmunds price promise was great.All dealers gave different discounts so we just picked the best one that had the SQ5 with all the options we wanted. Only had the car 2 weeks but just completed a trip to Canada and it is just a pleasure to drive. I\\'ve had other sports cars before and we just traded a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee for the Audi. No Comparison. Besides the original price the Audi is in another league. Hopefully I\\'ll be saying the same in a few years. 2106 Audi SQ5 Love this car so far. Debadged sleeper Can be driven quiet, smooth and refined or turn up the performance and still keep the smooth and refined ride but with an amazing soundtrack. So much more fun than a Macan, save the $$, express some individuality and retain some credibility.It\\'s the thinkers\\' choice. Now 2 years later and still very pleased, has the same, if not better, well proven real life performance as a Macan Turbo or AMG GLC without the obvious overtones or questionable Korean Car Show looks. Super sporty for a truck Legacy of many sports cars here with a small collection, but first sport SUV.  Traded a 2013 335i sport line which was an amazing car.   Acceleration is less in SQ5 than the Bimmer, but everything else is extremely comparable.   Handling tightly the curvy NC mountain roads, crushing light to light performance on the straight roads of Florida, limo like feel for the date nights with my wife, and of course Quattro safety.   Cannot say enough great things.   My wife is a hard sell on my sports car addiction, but this car  is now her daily driver passing by our corvettes, BMW M4, and others including a Hummer that she calls \"too slow\" (and it is).  Accolades to Audi.   We keep coming back, and have had A6 4.2, S4 Cabrio, but this is our best Audi yet. What a sleeper of a CUV! This vehicle scoots! I love my SQ5!I really thought I wanted the Porsche Macan S, which similarly configured would have cost me about $2 grand more. It had a better interior, certainly more head turning appeal and better steering. The practical side of me thought the Audi will net fewer tickets if for no other reason than the police wouldn’t get as big of a thrill writing a ticket on an Audi. Besides, this is my daily driver and bottom line was the best “practical” choice of the two.Now the pros/cons: The good – Wow! What a fun driving experience! It sits up high and accelerates like an S4/S6, even besting the hp output. I can’t say enough about how much fun this vehicle is to drive! It stops quickly and has a solid feeling stance as it hugs the road. The WiFi and Google maps round out a very nice technology package (I will always want Google Maps from here on in every vehicle). So the bad: no USB ports (really!?!) and a small 7.5” screen in a car today seems tiny. Rounding out my dislikes is storage space is not great and the steering, although tight is not what I would expect from a German-made premium vehicle.The overall sporty drive, understated classy looks, ride comfort and technology make this one of my favorite cars to own. I look for reasons to run out for something just to drive it!Lastly, golf clubs will fit fore to aft if you slide the rear seats forward a couple inches. I Allways enjoy the car. Very nice car but if your planning get ready to change the Tires for every 15-18KIm on 42k now, Changed Tires Twice already.Waiting for SQ7  A spectacular failure I see great reviews here for this vehicle and I\\'d add my name to the list of praise. Great vehicle. Fast. Well-made. Roomy. In fact the only complaint I have is how \\'worthless\\' the car was after I\\'d driven it 50K plus. The disastrous resale was shockingly terrible. It makes you look at the SQ5 in a whole new light. Brutal. Worse than you\\'d expect. Did I say terrible? But owning this vehicle has been flawless. It delivered everything I expected. I wished the ride wasn\\'t so hard and seats so unforgiving. But that\\'s the tight ride quality sacrifice, it is a wickedly fast beast and can handle itself easily with all that going on. With room for whole family and much more. A really expensive reality of owning this car is the tires. 2K per 25-30K mi. Kinda eye-opening. Strangely, the MPG never bothered me, it was very good for a beast like this. Final opinion: a bummer of toxic-level bad resale value and operating costs-- yet a brilliant, awesome vehicle. SUV & Sports Car in 1 I had a 2011 Audi convertible which i loved. But I needed a little more room. After one test drive in the SQ5 I could not stop thinking about it until I bought it. I have the prestige model with the silver inlay dash accents. The SUV inside and out is a real beauty. The engine is so smooth and fast its amazing. I have only had a month but I can not wait to drive it everyday.  It just keeps getting better every time I drive it... I bought this car because I was dying for an upgrade, needed more storage than my previous sedan, and really wanted something that brought a smile to my face when I hit the gas.This car is the absolute best all around vehicle I\\'ve ever owned.It\\'s fast, elegant, comfortable... I can\\'t say enough good things.It\\'s so striking inside and out.I park it and stare back as I walk away.The LEDs are gorgeous, the interior is exquisite, and the engine sounds incredible.Add the 21\" Wheel package which is a great value at $800, and the Bang and Olufsen sound system is a must.It sounds amazing and is worth the $850 price tag. 2014 SQ5 Just got mine a month ago and love it! Ride, build, and looks are sweet. Too early to give much of a review... but for now I\\'m loving it! Beguiled Buyer Purchased leave return. I loved the way it looked, made heads turn, the power, and fuel mileage.  Bought certified lease return because they come with a 100,000 mile warranty.  Made me feel safe.  The car started using a lot of oil. Audi refills for free. The car started using 1/2 every 1000 miles.  I was told normal. It still ran like scalded dag.  I finally complained enough at the dealership that they \"marked\" my engine and did an oil consumption test at 78,000 miles.  The engine was shot.  It needed new pistons and rings.  Worse news oil consumption is NOT covered by Audi\\'s extended warranty.  I also learned the 2.0 turbo aluminum block does NOT have steel sleeves.  I wont even discuss the rotor issue, sun roof failure, oil separator failure......etc. My Audi CarPlay Out of all the car in the world, I chose this one.  Sure I also wanted 35 mpg.  But it get a true 28.1 on my first highway drive.  And the comfort factor along with the B&0 speaker system.  (Sweet).  No problems so far.  But I\\'m deciding on an extended warranty to address any expensive problems.  I love this car... Loved my car until it died I bought my Audi Q5 new in 2012 after owning a VW Passat wagon which handled like a dream, but couldn\\'t handle upstate NY pot holes. I maintained my Audi religiously through the dealership, all recalls were done when notified. At 80,000, (2010?)suddenly I had to start adding oil b4 the next oil change service. I questioned the dealership and was told that was to be expected because of the age of the vehicle & to keep adding oil. This continued for 2 1/2 years, and being continually reassured by the dealership. The oil light was coming on more frequently, I kept adding more oil. 2 months ago I went to a different dealership-(the original dealer is no longer dealing in Audi). They told me my pistons were bad, something had been manufactured incorrectly and there had been an issue that Audi knew of. To rectify the problem would cost me $6000. - again the dealer told me to just keep adding oil.  I checked into it on the internet- class action suit years 2008-2011. My car is an early 2012-manufacturered 02/12. Contacted Audi told me to pay 4 an oil compression test, which didn\\'t happened in time. My car is currently sitting in my driveway,@ 109,000 miles, undriveable and awaiting a tow truck because it suddenly does no more than 23 miles an hour.  Audi\\'s not sure what my out come will be!? AND that I should prepared myself for the outcome.  WOW talk about stabbing loyal owners in the back. Get a Mercedes, BMW or Volvo. Turbo Lag spoils the fun A really nice size little sport utility vehicle that has a really hard time after stoplight Turbo Lag spoils the fun A really nice size little sport utility vehicle that has a really hard time after stoplight Good device Good SUV in looks and to drive. My dream come true Shop around for the lowest interest rate. Q5 Audi--Very overrated and Un-reliable I purchased this Audi Q5 from the original owner with 23000 on it. The brake rotors and pads were replaced at 19000 miles. I should have questioned this service at such low mileage--big mistake. I take excellent care of a car and drive it in a very sensible manner. It needed brakes again at 35000 miles, including rotor replacement.  At 38500 it had to have major engine repair--too much carbon build in the engine. It was over three years old, so the warranty was gone.  Big $$$ to repair. Fuel injectors needed replacement at 42000 miles. In summary, I would describe this high dollar car as poor quality, unreliable, very expensive to maintain and very overrated. The local Audi dealer is good, but with labor rates at $135.00 per Hr. well it just is not worth it. I would not recommend an Audi nor will I purchase one in the future Q5 Reliable, safe, comfortable and fun to drive! Great Little SUV I bought my 2012 Q5 brand new.  I chose the 3.2 engine because when I test drove the 2.0, I couldn\\'t stand the way the turbo charger whined every time the car shifted. I love the way it hugs the road. I have driven in snow and ice without chains or studded tires and never had a problem. The back seats are not that comfortable for long trips though. It really should be considered a four seater unless the center seat in the back is occupied by a car seat.  The biggest complaint I have about this vehicle are the oversized side view mirrors. I have to make a point of looking all around them. A couple of times I could not see the people in the crosswalk because the driver side mirror was blocking them completely. I once cut off a motorcycle because he was behind the passenger side mirror. I need to look into after-market smaller side mirrors. The cargo room with the rear seats in the upright position could be a little larger. Great turning radius. Handles really well. Best car for teenager to learn to drive. Quiet. Working the navigation system is confusing.  Not a great paint job. My dog\\'s nails left a deep scratch in the bumper while he was getting into the cargo area. 2012 AUDI Q5 - IT\\'S A LEMON! I bought this car new in 2012. Four years later the engine died, and the dealership wanted to charge me $6,100 to essentially replace the entire top half of the engine, due to a timing chain defect, and they refused to pay anything toward it. Absolutely unacceptable for a car that\\'s basically new, with only approximately 75,000 miles on it. I made sure that I took it for an oil change every 3,000 miles and regularly scheduled service. If you are planning on purchasing an Audi Q5, DON\\'T DO IT! Do your online research (timing chain/transmission/etc.) and you\\'ll see how poorly made these vehicles are. Very Sporty, great quality but This 2012 car (Premium) was not even on my radar as I wanted another sporty SUV but they did not have the color and specs I wanted. So my husband and I came across the Audi Q5 and was like no way because of the name, maintenance costs associated and the funky controls but when we test drove it plus the low mileage (off of a lease), I fell in love.  I think my husband more so.  It was sporty, luxurious (black w/brown leather interior), not too big.  I was not crazy about getting a 4cyl coming from a Lexus RX300 6cyl because I like a little pedal power but the sport mode seemed to have enough get up and go.  Now that I have had the car almost 9 months I can adequately give an informed review on my first Audi, albeit used and extensive.  PROS:   It is definitely a sporty, luxurious SUV, love the look of the interior and exterior especially the inside lights at night; nice sound system, great gas mileage, roomy trunk, roof etc.  Interior quality is nice and for a 4cyl it has nice power in turbo/sport mode.  CONS:  I felt like I needed a Ph.D. in Audi.  It is not intuitive, e.g. sunroof.  Like other reviewers, the multimedia system can be confusing and is disappointing especially the location because although I use the wheel controls I still find myself looking down and that is dangerous.  I feel like I\\'m controlling an aircraft or an ultrasound machine with the rotary dial, push, turn, push turn dial; some of my FM stations don\\'t always come in unless I hit my presets.  My 20 yr old son and I cannot believe I have to buy several adapters in order to listen to  music on our iphones.  Other cars have easier bluetooth hookups than this car.   Putting the adapter in the glove box was just idiotic. Radio text should be automatic.  The Navigation is old and useless because Audi wants you to buy a cd for updated maps...not.  Let\\'s not even talk about the brake dust every two seconds.  The backseat is a little tight but even tighter for 3 people as the hump takes up leg room.  I am coming up on 30k and the maintenance schedule says to change spark plugs at 35k???  Really?  Spark plugs should last 75k-100k!?  Overall I love the look and feel of the Q5 but I paid for the name and look.  The maintenance costs are too high at Audi.  Although I did my research which had many good reviews, but at this price ($35k), I do not think I would ever buy a used 4cyl again (despite turbo) at this price point with so many issues or lack of certain things as stated above. I will keep this car for a few more years and probably give it to my son and hope it lasts 10-15 years like my Lexus but will go back to a 6cyl SUV that is sporty with easier \"touch\" controls and less issues. Car of my dreams turns out to be a dud! I\\'ve wanted this car for 4 years. I finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure. Only 35k miles when I purchased and was a lease return (keep in mind I made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when I purchased it). I have owned this car less than one year and put 20k miles on it. I had completed the 45k mile service no problem. Just took it in for the 55k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush, oil pressure valve replacement and of course that\\'s on top of the $399 price tag for the \\'normal\\' maintenance at 55k miles. All of that totalling $2,300!! And I haven\\'t even owned the vehicle for a year. I knew that audi\\'s were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors. I\\'m not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed. On a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless. After this experience I have lost faith in Audi. I definitely will not be purchasing one again. I do not feel that this car is worth the price tag...disappointing altogether. It Makes Me Smile I have shopped for an SUV for three years, awaiting the Jeep Cherokee, then opting for the AWD Nissan Rogue. When I couldn\\'t get the color and version I wanted on time, I found a 2012 Q5 very lightly used for the same price as these new cars...only12k miles.\\r Today I took it on the infamous run to costco and found myself smiling...when the back gate opens automatically, when I stashed the wine bottles in the compartment under the rug, when I got in and turned on the Bang & Olufsen upgraded sound, and when the turbo kicked in and I shot past another car uphill. \\r The build quality is excellent and this 3 yr old feels tight and solid. After my last Nissan Murano, it feels like a sports car 2.0 L is plenty fast Very satisfied with our 2012 Q5. I would recommend the smaller engine to anyone. Very quick and plenty fast. Great gas mileage. The 8-speed must help that. My only grip about the engine is sound at idle when you are outside. It is only a sputter that comes out of the exhaust.  Nice Car - Horrible service Audi service is horrible.I bought new a Q7 TDI and a Q5 for my wife.First the Audi dealer overfills the oil in the Q7 causing all kinds of problems and would not fix them because the car was just out of warranty.Then my coolant in the Q5 starts leaking all over the garage and they say it wonÂ\\x92t be fixed under warranty because the leak could be caused from an Â\\x93outside influenceÂ\\x94.I called Audi America who says Â\\x93sorryÂ\\x94 nothing we can doÂ\\x85.I am going to relay my terrible experience on every blog I can find.Such a shame as I really loved the Q7 and thought I could get more than 70k miles out of it.FYI- Criswell in Annapolis was the dealer.  Lovely vehicle but far too many issues for the price We\\'ve owned a Premium Plus (3.2) Q5 for around four months and have driven it extensively in city and on highway.It\\'s a fine vehicle, very comfortable, and has plenty of power.However, there are many small issues with the car that really boggle the mind at the $50k-ish price.1. The multimedia system is, frankly, awful. It\\'s design that feels a decade old, the control dial scrolls things the opposite way from other consumer devices (eg iPod), and the menu system is convoluted.2. The GPS is completely useless. The maps provided with the car are at least 4-5 years old and the routing is poor.3. The gas cap cover has broken already, 4 months in. Flimsy construction. audi the best Audi Q5 2012 my first and last suv.great to drive quiet, fun great handling, suspension, steering and trans, can be adjusted to your taste,all in all its the best  Rear hazards of the car  Overall, great car.However, I would alert families to that the 2 tailpipes are nice looking but extend too far out from the car.I have a crescent shaped burn on my shin when I let the dog out of the back.Three small boys eating a snack off the back nearly missed being burned by these pipes.Since these events, I\\'ve noticed that most car makers do a better job of hiding the tail pipe under the bumper. Also, rear door does not stop quickly enough and for small objects in it\\'s line of descent to a closed position.My son who is only 9 had it push down on him.If you can\\'t get bags, body parts or dog paws out of the way in time, it could dangerous. 2012 Q5 @ 20k Miles - Great SUV We just passed 20k miles on a 2012 2.0T Premium Plus; and just passed the 1 year anniversary of buying this vehicle.Overall this has been a great crossover SUV.Made it through the Chicago Winter and I found myself driving it more than my 2010 4Runner with 4WD.The AWD is great in the snow and on icy roads.The front seats offer a lot of room, and at 6\\'3\" AND 250 lbs.....I fit in this car just fine.Plenty of head room.More head room than most full size SUVs.The back section doesn\\'t offer as much storage space as a full size SUV, but the back seats to fold (almost) flat to make a pretty good sized cargo space.If you need to haul a lot on a long trip, the integrated roof rails Q5 2.0 Premium After 12,000 miles Amazingly fun to drive.Averaging over 25 mpg in mixed driving with a high of 29 and a low of 23.Transmission is quiet and smooth (unless I drive really hard, you don\\'t even notice the shifts).Virtually no oil loss over my last oil change (7000 plus miles).Get the Audi Care Package as Service Costs are high. Q5 Audi review The Audi Q5 is a wonderful addition to the Audi line up. This vehicle is traditional Audi with all the bells and whistles that makes an Audi and Audi. Great pick up and tight steering.It drives just as a German car should drive. The 8 speed automatic transmission is very smooth. The keyless entry and push button actions are what one would expect from a luxury vehicle.It is fun to drive. Mine came with the technology package which is a bit disappointing.  My last car was a BMW X5, Audi rules! I think my title says it all! My last car was a top of the line X5 , with everything on it. I paid cash for it brand new. I owned it for 7 years....problems, little niggly ones, all the time. Trim that didn\\'t fit, rattles, BMW issues! I loved driving that car though.  My Q5...leased it as I was wary about buying...everything has been perfect since day one. The fit and finish are perfect, driving it\\'s wonderful and the dealer is 100% hassle free.Including the free car washes!  Good but room for improvement... This is a very nice car/cross over.Fun ride but you can feel all road blemishes.It handles extremely well.Very responsive steering. It has surprising acceleration. Excellent headlights.Not a wimpy looking cross over so as a guy, you won\\'t be embarrassed.The Multi Media System... well lets just say they blew it (see below).My wife can\\'t figure it out so she sticks with FM stations. 2012 Q5 2.0T Premium Recently purchased the Q5 Premium with what appears to be the standard Option list in my area of Heated Seats, Sunroof, and Convenience Package.Only other option was the Monsoon Grey paint (I hate the extra charge for Paint). Car drives like an A4 with better utility.Gas mileage has been on the higher side (I drive mainly on a Parkway - with Stop & Go Traffic).Deceptively fast as you almost always feel you are going slower then the Speedo indicates, and quite smooth for an CUV.I should have ordered a Premium Plus stripped for the same base price, but did not want to wait 6 extra weeks.Best description, a Sports sedan in CUV body! Great car, bad brake! Purchased the car new. Love everything about the car with the exception that from day one the brake squeaks, especially before it is going into a complete stop. In addition, the car produces a ton of brake dust: it will coat all the wheels with this dark metallic powder just a few days after cleaning, which completely messes up the appearance of the car, makes you feel like dressed up in a piece of brand new suit matched with a pair of stinky, worn out sneakers! Q5 is Like an Apple Product I have a 2.0 Silver/Black with Moon Roof, Convenience package, Heated Seats and Exhaust Tips.In my area it was very difficult to find the 2.0 so I had to go 70 miles away to get one.I have no regrets.My Q5 feels like an Apple product and every time I am in it, it makes me feel good.It is fun to drive and the interior and exterior are top notch.I have owned 2 BMW sedans previously and also looked at the X3 very hard.I am a type that sticks to what has worked in the past and the 2 BMW\\'s I had were just fine.I had some reservations about Audi\\'s past quality issues.The bottom line for me was the Q5 was superior in everyway like an Apple product. Very sorry I bought this car. The Q5 is great but I\\'ve had a very bad experience with mine and can\\'t give it a good review.The skylight shattered by itself in very cold weather, and the dealer told me it is a known issue with the 2012 Q5 in cold weather.The dealer has had the car for a month and its still not fixed.They say the skylight has to come from Germany and they can\\'t get a correct replacement part.Rusnak says the\\'ll make it up to me by giving me a couple of payments, but it doesn\\'t really make up for the time lost.I bought the car because I wanted to drive it, and so far, it just hasn\\'t worked out. One happy driver Love my Q5 premium plus 2.0 turbo!I have owned it for 10 months and would not trade it for another SUV.Mileage is great and the drive is pure comfort.Bluetooth is wonderful if you NEED to talk.I would never get another vehicle without Bluetooth.A colleague is getting Q5 through a dealer swap in approximately 10 days.  Awesome SUV This is a super car to own and drive. Have it for 3 months now and have about 3500 miles on it. As reported in many other reviews, this SUV rides nice and tight, feels fast, drives fast and is a lot of fun. Extremely quiet interior and the sunroof is huge.  2012 Q5 Prem Plus + Nav 2.0T This cross-over is an amazing vehicle to drive. It handles like you would expect an Audi to handle. The Exterior is sleek, sexy and screams confidence. The interior is well laid out and the navigation system is a must optional upgrade. The panoramic roof lets the world into the cabin as your cruise around town. The steering does seem a little artificial at low speed,but as the car picks up the tightness and Audi feel kicks in. The 2.0T engine hums and out performs the 3.2 New Q5 Owner We\\'ve had our new Q5 for a month. We\\'ve driven an Acura MDX for awhile and love it. In terms of comfort and driving experience though, the Q5 is several steps beyond the Acura! Extremely quiet, firm comfortable ride, nimble handling, plenty of power from the 2.0T - even up the step grade of I-70 west of Denver. And, so far good gas mileage, about as advertised, but much better than our Acura. The tech\\'y stuff takes a little getting used to, Nav, Bluetooth, media, and personal/car settings. The car is a perfect size for a couple of empty nesters who will use this car on trips ... might be tad small for a family trip! An Excellent Buy I own a 2011 Volvo XC60 and now a 2012 Audi Q5. Although very different cars, they both are excellent buys. However, the Audi is just plain fun to drive. It lets you \"feel\" the road and is responsive. I have had it for only 2 weeks, but I am in love with the car, its looks, and the layout of the interior controls.  4 wonderful cylinders The 2.0T knocks the socks off most V6\\'s.Off the line and anywhere in the RPM curve.The 8 speed transmission is a huge part of this performance, but I love every sound this car makes and driving it is a pure pleasure.Highway miles are exactly as promised at 27mpg, and road noise is minimal.Go for the 2.0T and never look back.The panoramic sun roof is amazing and rolling over uneven pavement provokes zero body noises.This is a solid car. Expectation Fulfilled I custom ordered a White/Cinnamon Q5 2.0T Premium Plus for my wife, which we took delivery of on July 30th.The car has meet our every expectation for comfort, utility, handling, and ride quality.The only thing missing is the backup camera\\'s computer chip, which we were told is months behind in production from the Japanese supplier due to the tsunami.Despite an ok power rating of 211bhp, the car is very torquey.So, off-the-line acceleration and passing power are excellent.We got the B&O sound system, which sounds excellent and was worth the extra $750.My wife says that driving it feels like wearing a comfortable pair of jeans. When she\\'s happy, I\\'m happy. Great  Drives great, rides great - this is the best driving crossover/SUV I\\'ve even driven.Better overall quality/finish than the BMW X3, and nothing else comes close.The 2.0T engine has plenty of power, and the acceleration is much better than you would suspect - passing power on the highway is excellent.Options on the \\'Premium Plus\\' are nice - Zenon Lights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, sunroof, dual setting memory seats.I don\\'t know how much you get from a dual-zone climate control when you are sitting right next to the passenger - it\\'s just one more thing to adjust.The bluetooth hands-free connection to a mobile phone, and speaker/mic is excellent.Highly recommended!!! Gorgeous Love this car - I\\'m still breaking it in, but having had 3 new A4\\'s in the last 12 years, this one felt like coming home (albeit with larger rooms).Have kiddies on the way so the extra room will help - cargo space is not huge but is adequate.The 2.0 litre had more balls than I expected - nowhere near as clunky as the Q7 I test drove- this one handles like the 2009 A4 with the same motor - pulls nicely and sits down while cornering.The moonlight blue is stunning - I wished I could\\'ve seen one with the cinammon interior but only the light tan was available.You\\'ll notice the screen displays are sharper - kind of like going from an iPhone 3G to the sharper 4. Buyer beware: Major reliability issue 2018 Q5 Purchased car in November of 2017. Have been very happy with it until August of 2018 (13K miles) when the  engine self destructed. Audi is in the process of replacing the engine.  Dealership has been ho-hum about the whole thing and haven\\'t even managed to provide me with a loaner vehicle going on a week now. Given the catastrophic failure of their product, I assumed that a higher level of customer service would be in play but that is not the case. I dont like a car that thinks its smarter then me. I have owned my Q5 for 7 months and 6700 miles. There has never been a time that I’ve driven this car that I haven’t gotten aggravated to no end with its stupidity. Let me paint a picture about their pre-Sense anti collision assistance. Driving down the New Jersey Turnpike I proceed to pass another car. Turn signal on, drift in the left, start to accelerate and BAM! ABS is activated intent on stoping this car. Well. needless to say I get the sign a peace from the gentleman behind and and really Obnoxious horn beeping. Rightfully so.I look like an idiot that pulled out and tried to stop.  That happen twice. The dealer tells me they’re aware their pre sense  is very sensitive and it’s for my protection. really there wasn’t even a car in front of me.   Issue number two. The transmission.  When I start out from a stop  The transmission has to decide what gear it supposed to be in before we go, clunking and banging . OK off we go. the transmission  is interested in doing one thing and that’s getting into the highest gear Possible before you go 15 feet no matter what your input is. You would think? being a perceived highline German car Audi would’ve engineered out this unsophisticated jolting and horrible mapping of a transmission.  The paddle shifters are a toy. the car will override your imput whenever it feels like. Even in manual mode.   Let’s talk about Aceleration. Better yet here’s an exercise if you’re so inclined to test drive one. On ramp simulation. Bring the car down to about 5 miles an hour, now there’s room to Merge in. Consider allTraffic is doing 60 to 70 miles an hour. so punch the Pedel  to the floor. I guarantee there will be a three second delay before that car moves. pretty scary with your nose out in traffic.  There are other issues but I think you get my point .I would seriously think long and hard and test drive the hell out of this car if you decide to consider. From experience your dealership will be no help. Audi corporate could care Less and will send you back to the dealer telling you that all is normal.All that being said I will say that once the car gets moving it’s comfortable, it’s not quiet and you need to pay attention to keep it straight. Mine likes to continually try to drift Left.Again Audi tells me all is good, And typical of all wheel drive cars that are front wheel drive biased... Wrong! Thanks for reading. In closing. save yourself some money this is not a Highline car and there are much better cars out there for what you will spend for this. A potential winner Nice vehicle but selling approach can improve and ask is the brand looking to build a relationship or execute a transaction. Fire hazard Notified of a recall for my q5 due to fire hazard. Parts for repair not available until late 2018.  My dealer jack daniels told me to call Audi USA... Audi USA told me to contact my dealer.  They refuse to provide a loaner and told me to stop driving the car if a light goes on the dashboard. They couldn’t tell me what the light looks like. Also told me not to garage the car. Terrible company to deal with. Noisy car with problems, customer service sucks The car makes a watch-like rapid ticking noise from day one, took the car to  the dealership multiple times and were told its the normal operation of the car. Car keeps pulling to the right, where the alignment can\\'t fix, again dealership told me it\\'s normal. Central locking intermittently beeps when lock the car. Worked with Audi customer service to resolve the issues. In the end, they basically told me to stay away, and every issue I had with the car is normal. My mistake to buy a car that manufacture doesn\\'t stand behind their product. STAY FAR AWAY FROM AUDI. Noisy Q5 If you are interested in buying a Audi Q5, take it on the freeway for along test drive. My vehicle front end is very noisy. Service adviser went on a test drive with me and he said it is the highway. They will not admit that it is the noisy vehicle. I\\'m sorry I bought this vehicle. I will not advise anyone to purchase a AUDI ever. Love my Audi Q5 This car has the right combination of luxury, handling and utility. Our second Q5 has exceeded expectations Great car, but sticker price is way inflated. Don\\'t buy for anything less than 10% of MSRP. Love my Q5, with just a few niggles I\\'m 10,000 miles into a lease on a 2018 Premium Plus Q5, due to go in for it\\'s first service and have had no major problems at all with the vehicle. Reading reviews here, you\\'d think the vehicle is falling apart, but mine is awesome. I have had some issues with minor things - I wish the Bluetooth connection would stay active even when the cable is plugged in (or, would pick up even when I unplug the charging cable). I wish there were more storage cubbies - my iPhone 7+ doesn\\'t fit in anything, and the cup holders are a bit silly. But, the digital cockpit is amazing. On road trips, I can get over 30mpg on cruise control and the vehicle cruises at higher speeds than you notice. Gave up my 2018 Audi Q5 after 2 months I like a comfortable riding car, I\\'m in it for long periods of time, so it should be comfortable. I made the switch to the 2018 Audi Q5 from a 2013 Lexus RX350. This Audi is definitely a beautiful luxury vehicle, and I love bells and whistles in my car so I got the Prestige version. If you have any personal padding in your backside, you will hate these hard seats. I just could not get comfortable no matter what I adjusted, it cut me in the back of the thigh. Driving for any period of time was painful.  It drove beautifully, and was responsive, but I just didn\\'t click with this car. Technology wise,  I love the heads up display that kept me informed of the local speed limit, and how fast I was going right next to each other. But, I found the center console technology had to get used to, dial this, push that, if there a 3 lines on one side there\\'s another menu, a plus on the other side of the screen meant another menu. Dial, menu, dial, menu. There is NO room in the console, no place to put your phone, very hard to reach cup holders, and a center console box that is so small it wouldn\\'t hold a small box of Kleenex. The shifter moves back and forth for reverse, neutral, and drive pressing one button, but there was a separate button to push for park... and no noise alerting you to being in park. The car is so quiet,  and the radio is still on until you open a door, half the time I didn\\'t remember if I turned the car off. And the worst thing I could not get used to was no memory seats that side back when you get out of the vehicle, and no remote start. Remote start is not available in any Audi. I traded it in after only 2 months, and  it lost $10,000 in value! I absolutely would have gone back to a new Lexus if I liked the grill on the last few years versions, if they change that it a few years, I will go back to Lexus. In the meantime, I went with a Nissan, next best thing to a Lexus. Lemon! Like other reviewers, I was very excited to have decided to buy a brand new 2018 Audi Q5.  I did months of research and based on reliability and owner satisfaction scores in Consumer Reports, I went with the Q5 over a Volvo XC60.  I am regretting that choice.  I have owned the vehicle for less than 2 months.  The night I brought it home the front driver\\'s side turn signal stopped working.  It sat in the shop for 4 days while they replaced both headlight assemblies.  Then last week, with just 2500 miles on the car, the engine failed which landed me broken-down on the side of the road with my 90-year-old Grandpa on a short road trip.  Now the dealer said that an entire new engine has to put in the car.  The dealer acts like they are doing me a favor, instead of being embarrassed and apologetic for this poor quality vehicle.  Owning an Audi has been nothing but a nightmare. Wow Wow factor is in high gear on all the bells and whistles in this car.  Dazzling displays, lux at every corner and rides like a dream.  The price tag for leasing is high, so still deciding. Not in love with it...yet. I\\'m a former BMW X5 owner (16 years), and I went back and forth between the BMW and Audi dealerships for over a month. I decided the Audi was a superior ride and overall a better price point equipped with the features I wanted. I custom ordered my Q5 and waited 4 months for delivery. My first week with the vehicle I had two problems, a popping/clicking sound behind the dash (they said was normal) and a metal/clicking sound when you release the brake pedal. 4 months later the brake pedal just got fixed (replaced brake booster assembly). Overall the ride and drive (especially on the freeway) and interior quiet are superior. The custom wrap-around warm weather package seats took some getting used to; I ordered as I found the standard seats too short. They make it difficult sliding in and out of the vehicle, and they\\'re hard. And overall, the car doesn\\'t fit me very well (I\\'m 5\\'11 and 190#). The interior quality of materials are cheap; I feel as if I\\'m in a Toyota or Suburu. Plasticy doors, thresholds, etc. Nothing compared to my former BMW. I\\'m undecided if I will keep the Q5 long term; I don\\'t love it and I don\\'t feel like I\\'m driving a luxury vehicle. HAPPY OWNER DUE YOUR HOMEWORK TO GET A GREAT PRICE Better Than Advertised! I have not any initial quality problems in the 5,000 miles I have leased the Q5...so far this is the best SUV I have owned by a wide margin. The Q5 drives well in the city (San Francisco) and the front and rear collision systems have proved invaluable on several occasions! I am pleased to get 14+ m.p.g. around town and it \"coasts\" well. The Q5 is at its best on I-80 to Lake Tahoe...cruising along at 70+ and getting 33+m.p.g. on the flats in \"automatic\" mode. Once in the mountains I switch to \"individual\" mode (tighter steering) for better feel of the road. In winter conditions the Quattro system has worked flawlessly...no \"fishtailing\" as my 2013 BMW X3 did! I am still learning about all of the technology packed  into the Q5 (even with no nav system...but the iPhone works well for me!)...reading the Owner\\'s Manual does help! So far the Q5 is \"better than advertised\"! Love my q5 I’m short. The seats elevate enough that I can see over the console AND the steering wheel!! Wanted to give it all 5’s Having a problem with the sport heated/ventilated front seats in 2018 Q5. The drivers seat doesn’t heat much at all- dealer measured it at 88 degrees.  The passengers goes to 95, still very poor. The service tech at Audi dealer initially said  those numbers were “within spec”. After further discussion, they agreed to bring it up with Audi rep, who said this is an emerging concern with Audi and the engineers in Germany were working on it. No one will give me a timeframe on a fix, which I’m told is just a software code update. Very frustrating, brand new luxury vehicle should deliver what you pay for. A little small for the Big & Tall I\\'m 6\\'-5\" and my jacket size is 58 long. My main complaint about the 2018 Q5 is that the B-pillar is too far forward. It impedes entry to the driver\\'s seat.  The Audi seat doesn\\'t adjust to a low enough position for my taste, and while it has way more than enough legroom and seat travel, my left shoulder and left arm have nowhere to go once the seat is positioned because the B-pillar is really awkward. The audio controls are weird. The \"volume knob\" is just a little thing off to the side of the center console and doesn\\'t make much sense to me at all. Operating the yacht handle shifter is weird too. I own a 2014 S5 with the 7 speed DSG and this Q5 7-speed is not the DSG, but it is extremely smooth and quiet and fun to shift the paddles. On the highway, seventh gear will get you good mileage, but it\\'s worthless for accelerating. Sixth gear though, is perfect and dropping to 4th at 75 mph really wakes things up. Driving the Q5 did make me feel like a boss and most of the time the shoulder/elbow room issue was easy to forget about with both hands on the wheel. Very nice Great interior. Slightly underpowered but overall great suv I expected more I had researched the car quite a bit and really wanted to like it.   Disappointed. Technology Nightmare..2018 SQ5 Purchased car on Sunday.  Check engine light came on Monday morning.  Took back to dealer.  They had to replace some sensors.  Took a week to test, get the part (had to order another part after replacing emissions sensor).    Technology is a nightmare.  Need an IT degree to figure out how to turn off all the driver assist features you don\\'t want.  The worst is the MMI system for Bluetooth. WiFi, and syncing your phone.  I just wanted to use my IPod to listen to music but, unlike every other car I have driven, it isn\\'t as simple as plugging it in the USB port.   Apparently, the technology is so new it doesn\\'t recognize my iPod that is only three years old.  They should have backward compatibility for devices.  Other than technology concerns, this car is a rocket.  It is smooth and very fast. 5 issues in first 45 days; 20 days in shop. With 900 miles, we have gone through the following. 1). Sunfroof shade replaced, then entire sunroof. 2) Front power windows; when trying to go “auto-up,” they would sometimes go all the way down and we couldn’t stop then. 3) The dash vent had PLASTIC DEBRIS FROM THE VENT which is NOT smooth but jagged; they fell into the vent and RATTLED until we almost lost our minds.  Took Audi 2 visits of 8 and 14 days to diagnose!  4) Rear LED reading lights don’t work properly.  Needed to be replaced.  Unbelievable.  Never had these issues with BMW, Porsche, Toyota, or Ford.  I will never buy another Audi. On my 2nd Q5, and love it more Had a 2014 Q5, for 3 1/2 years, that was totaled (other driver ran a stop sign and plowed into me).  That car had not given me any issues so for me it was a no-brainer to buy the 2018.  It\\'s only been 3 months, but I love this car.  I like the safety features (pre sense, rear traffic alerts etc.) .  Engine performance is better than the 2014 - peppier, more horsepower, and so far I\\'m seeing better mileage than my 2014.  I generally get 22 or so in mixed driving, and roughly 27 highway.  I\\'ve seen some of the bad reviews and frankly I\\'m surprised.  I can\\'t say whether I\\'m lucky or they are unlucky but in any event I\\'m a happy owner. Fine ride! I picked up my ordered Q5 Prestige in August. I have always had at least one model of BMW in my stable since 1969 and was ready to buy an X3. However, the Q5 was more to my liking due to a smoother ride ( hate stiff run flat tires) and superior performance from the 2 liter engine and technology that sets Audi apart from the competition. I also tested the Mercedes and Volvo and found them lacking compared to the Audi. First, the ride is firm but compliant and the point and shoot handling is magnificent. Secondly, the adaptive cruise control is on a par with the Subaru eyesight system and easy to use. Thirdly, the cabin is serenely quiet and beautifully appointed. I opted for the warm weather package which includes heated and ventilated sport seats which are very comfortable on long trips. Also the B&O sound system just blows away the others in sound quality. Apple Car Play is great and intuitive. The controls for all the technology takes a bit of getting used to but becomes intuitive after a while. Acceleration is excellent for an SUV and the WOW factor of the mapping display is addictive. For an old BMW enthusiast, I am extremely satisfied with my first Audi. I have had no issues with quality so far and based on Audi’s reputation, I don’t expect to for a long long time.  Awesome Vehicle Terrific vehicle to drive. Q-5 audi disappointed i just bought Q5. compare to other cars, it looks better.  after i bought i found some problems, light malfunction signed showed up- it has fixed, clicking noise after it start and driver side heating seat(it does not get hot compare to other seats). It went to the service but they can not do anything. I have to pick up my car without any solution... just disappointed. Classic German Engineeering Ordered the prestige plus package in order to get the more comfortable front seats and adaptive cruise control. These were an important option due to many hours spent highway driving.  Lots to know about this vehicle.  On the positive side, the handling and acceleration are impressive for and SUV. 20 Inch rims are attractive and do not seem to add any ride harshness. The ride is ultra smooth, quiet, and serene, making long trips a pleasure. The interior is elegant as is typical of all Audi\\'s. Virtual dashboard is amazing and along with the heads up display aids keeping the drivers eyes on the road.  Adaptive cruise control works smoothly and effortlessly, Lane keeping assist is interesting and fun to experience.   Some niggling issues are the slow response from the transmission when shifting into reverse and attempting to do a quick maneuver such as a three point turn.  Apple car play works well but have lost some of the Spotify features found on my BMW interface, such as, saving a favorite song to my play list.  TPMS only tells you when there is a problem but does not show actual tire pressure. Less than 4K miles so far, no issues that would require attention from the dealership.  Many of the complaints I have read in the accompanying reviews are addressed in the Prestige package.  So far I am pleased with my purchase and would do it again. Somewhat disappointed in 2018 Q5 and in Audi I bought this car and 2 days later sent it back to the dealership because is was rocking from side to side and 85% of the time I was leaning to the right.  They kept the car for 8 days while they went through protocol with Audi to fix the problem.  In the end, it was the steering.  I kept saying it was a brand new car and not functioning and they should give me another one.  NO WAY!  I still believe it rocks right to left more than it should but I\\'m assured that it\\'s normal  The car has many nice features but I miss my Lexus RX350.  It\\'s definitely not a smooth ride and it rocks left and right.  The navigation system is too busy.  Many of the features I love,  The radio and the steering controls are great.  I love the safety features that tell me when a car is in my blindsight and help me to park and back up.  The visibility is excellent!   Maybe I\\'ll feel differently after driving this car for 6 months and when me Lexus is out of sight and out of mind. Dreamboat Bought new. Paid cash. 10K miles in less than a year. Mileage average 29.1.  Quiet, comfortable, great tech. One caveat. Get instruction from your dealer\\'s techie. I\\'m fairly savvy about such things, and figured out much of it. Consult with dealer\\'s techie revealed things I hadn\\'t discovered on my own. The owner\\'s manual reads like a tome on German theology, and as a seminary grad I should know. The clicking sound you hear when first starting off is the turn-on of the ABS. Well into year 2 and Doody the Audi is still the car I thought it would be. MPG still around 29 and still very quiet. Awesome Q5 this is a great car. love the tech audi have provided. 1st Time Audi Owner A big change from large sedan(Genesis) to smaller SUV and 1st time owning an Audi. Read alot of reviews and all indicating stellar redesign. Got a phenomenal price on Premium Plus with Bang and Olufsen sound system. So far, Audi measuring up to high reliability, Audi has made huge strides to improve overall product quality and reliability. All the technology works perfectly but took some getting used to at 1st. The PC like keybad and turn knob help keep your eyes on road and once mastered, it was well thought out design. I noticed other reviews indicating some problems but have not experienced any of these. I really like the proximity unlock feature for doors and Auto shutoff when in Park position.  Connection with Smartphone is seamless and fast and complete wireless operation. I am not a fan of Android Car play and rather use Audi Google map navigation system. Mileage is great so far and glad I downsized from V6 to 4 cylinder. The trunk space with back seats down is great and love the versatility of center only seat down. Audi Q5 Research all options before purchase, some that should come with Plus only come with Prestige.    Front storage is poorly designed. You cannot drive over 40 mph with one window open or the entire car will start to shake. Transmission takes a full second to change when switching from drive to reverse and visa versa. A fool & his money soon departed Pluses are the wonderful B & O sound system, acceleration\\', and the overall feel when driving. On the minus side is an overly stiff ride, noisy Continental tires, and wind noise from the side mirrors.  Also the stop-start feature is very noticeable and annoying.\\ufeff The ventilated seats are very uncomfortable. Firm and I call them lumpy because of the uneven feel. If you must have a Q5 I suggest ordering the Prestige model with the thicker glass to give you a quieter ride, plus it is a better deal than the Premium Plus with more features for about the same money. That was my mistake. Car grows on you/Lovin it now Lots a tech. I bought this for my wife. I\\'m not much of a tech guy and was regretting the purchase, then suddenly caught on. She\\'s loved it from the beginning but I found the tech to be distracting. The car handles beautifully, has a great smooth transmission and  awesome acceleration.  Radio with 19 speakers is dynamite and absolutely worth the extra buck. Gas mileage is excellent (26). The only negatives I find are cup holders and front storage are weak and awkward. The center console has no room and that whole setup is odd. A spilled soda has disaster written all over it. AUDI 2018 Q5 : Please dont buy Had and having very very disappointing and frustrating experience with Audi. Like all of You (buyers) I was dreaming about AUDI since many years and finally bought BRAND NEW 2018 Q5 few months back. But unfortunately, the car came with bunch of issues irrespective of paying full money for \\'premier plus\\'. Nope its not preowned, but a BRAND NEW Q5 2018. Already visited dealer 4th time for repairs and still the problems are not yet resolved. Please find the issues i\\'ve been going through. I dont want any other buyers to over the stress, loosing work hours and time after buying the BRAND NEW car. We dont deserve it.Problems fixed so far:1. Window regulator fixed2. Squeaking noise fixed.Existing Problems:1. Lights at the rear back seat does not work.2.  Auto-stop of engine does not work during stop signs or elsewhere.     On Loaner Q5 car : it did work with same AC setting3. Tail gate with leg kick does not work consistently.4. This is very important, there are numerous minute scratches on the glossy area b/w doors outside and inside trim. I can send the pictures. It looks Audi put the stickers before shipping. I checked my friend car too has and many cars in the showroom too.They cant deliver the car like this. So, Please check on all these before buying Your Dream car.If You want more information, Please message me, I will send out the pictures. Comfort Seats are “Discomfort Seats” Had a loaner 2017 premium plus for 3 weeks waiting for an ordered 2017 A6 to arrived. Loved the A6 Prestige so much I ordered a 2018 Q5 for my wife as soon as the adaptive cruise and other packages were available. It was equipped with comfort seats and everything else except warm weather package because the 2017 comfort seats were comfortable and the 2017 sports were very hard, narrow and less comfortable. The initial release cars were not fully equipped and the dealer did not have but 1 or 2 demos to test, not were we told the 2018 Q5?seats were being redesigned. From what others now say, the vented warm weather sports seats of the 2018 were made more comfortable,  though the seat bottoms and back still are very narrow with stiff plastic at the edge of the bottom and narrow upper bolsters. We waited 3 months to receive car and drove on short trips around town for a month. Then, took 2 hour trip ( 4 hours round trip) with spouse.  Both of us could hardly walk when it was over, and it took a couple days to get back to normal. From that point on, every time we sat in the Q5, our backs and bottoms began to hurt so much we couldn’t drive it any longer. The 8-way seats do not provided enough adjustments to fine a sweet spot and we could not live with the narrow seat bottom with hard sides, the lacked lumbar support for the passenger/limited height adjustment for driver, and very little upper back support. Plus the rear of the seat bottom cupped our bottoms in such a way as to cause pressure on our lower back. The dealer offered to buy it back as a used car and we took about a $10k hit, which was a bit better than if I had trued to trade. In hindsight, we should not have rushed to buy the 2018 Q5 just because we liked my 2017 A6, though it was a very cool looking, well engineered and popular vehicle around here. I personally loved the Infotainment and vehicle technology systems because they were so easy to use and were controlled from the center console, not on a touch screen. Plus, I got 31+ mpg on the one trip using the adaptive cruise/lane keeping to control the car. Only after we had to go looking for a substitute did we learn that the 2018 Volvo XC60 Inscription which came out after we ordered the Q5 offers all that the Q5 offers with great comfort and just a bit less mileage. The Bottom Line: If comfort is something important, better test drive a Q5 with both kinds of seat configurations on a trip of at least an hour or so before buying. The comfort seats are anything but comfortable. They could bring on back troubles that never were anticipated. Moreover, unless the buyer has narrow hips and back, fitting into the design offered by Audi will be challenging. Even if the buyer’s body fits in the seat compartment, he/she may not find an adjustments that allows for comfortable positioning. Love my 2018 Q5 Select Dynamic Drive.   Great performance. Comfort setting lags from start.  National Audi had no clue.   Took calling two dealerships to solve.  No reason to wait or pay more for the 3L turbo.   Driver seat too short front and back.  Steering wheel adjustment is manual.   Was concerned about the full glass roof being too bright.  The shade is great. Love it... It\\'s the best in the mid-size luxury SUV category. We looked at Jaguar f-pace and BMWx5 My Review Know that there are two types of front seats. Normal and sport seating.  The sport seating is very uncomfortable.  Overall I like the car. Audi Q5 2018 Intermittent window problem This is my brand new Audi Q5 that has an intermittent problem that occurs as follow:a) From a complete close position, I rolled down the window by a few inches.b) Then I rolled up the window by pulling the switch up (once or hold it)RESULT: Occasionally it will roll down completely as you can see from the recording !!!!I took the Q5 to the dealer and left it there for more than 1 week. They first said there was no problem until I demonstrated the problem, and the service manager experience the problem himself.They changed the the motor and the window seal . Still they cannot fix the problem .This is extremely frustrated because it is safety issue . In the winter, if I roll down my window by an inch to get some fresh air, then the snow plow on the opposite traffic comes with all the slush and salt and sand on the street, now I want to close my window, and it may roll down completely and expose me to the road hazard !!!!I was also told by the dealership that it happens with a few Q5 in their lot !!!!This is extremely frustrated . I will update how Audi addresses this problem. Poor Qualit/design Check the noise under the dash. solenoid activation noise every time start the car and reach sped between 15-20 mils. repaid the noise restart the car reach the same speed. per Audi it is normal. prior year Q5 does not make this noise or any Q7. or any other. Troubling Initial Quality Issues on 2018 Q5 After major camshaft failure within 250 miles of ownership on one of the last 2017 Q5\\'s, our car was swapped by Audi for a new 2018 Q5.  While we agreee with what others have written about the new 2018 Q5, the initial quality issues that we\\'ve encountered around the steering wheel and driver side mirror are extremely disappointing.  While we pointed out both issues on initial delivery of the car, both have unfortunately become long drawn out issues with service and then corporate Audi got involved.  The driver mirror had some unexplained heavy caking on inside, sides and bottom (almost like paint primer) that service rushed to clean, which they only got about 1/3 off.  Then left us with the car, so that they could work on it again when we brought back to replace the steering wheel that had a 1\" slit in the leather wheel at delivery.  Now the LED 1/8\" strip on that side view mirror is popping out, along with moisture seeping in and service is saying it\\'s not covered!  Would be interested in hearing from any other consumers with similar problem on the driver mirror and how you are resolving it, as replacing an entire side view mirror is quite expensive. new 2018 Q5 We own 4 other Audi\\'s between Vermont and Utah. Looked at Volvo and BMW Love my Audis This is my 5th Audi. A beautiful car that\\'s safe, reliable and fun to drive. I traded my 2016 Porsche Macan in for the 2018 Q5 premium plus (second p plus Q5 that I\\'ve owned). Worthy successor to my Q5 TDI While I miss the 600 mile per tank range of my 2015 Q5 TDI, everything else about this vehicle is excellent. 3rd Q5 in the family! I love the new design, and revamp of the engine. it drives smoother, zippier, and more fun through the canyons of LA. The tech is incredible versus the competition. the build quality and fit and finish is second to none in the segment. I checked out the X3 and the GLC. X3 is a great driving car, but lacks the fit and finish and tech. the GLC is just an awful \"cushy\" ride and tech is old. I am looking forward for this 3 year lease. LOVE IT! Love the new redesign! Looks better than Mercedes and BMW. Beautiful vehicle but....ABS clicks at 25mph This car is gorgeous.  I love how it drives and brakes and the technology is the best!  HOWEVER, the gas mileage averages ~20mpg and there is a clicking under the gas peddle at 25mph.  Between stop signs, red lights, and traffic, it makes my teeth grind every time because it\\'s constant in traffic.  It seems to be worse on some days.  Audi says there will be a fix pushed out to the vehicles but I have seen posts regarding the same issue for several years back.  This alone is making me think I should have considered another model. 2018 Q5 Premium Plus - Owner review - Minor nuisan I have ordered a 2018 X3 but decided to switch to the 2018 Q5 during last minute.   It was a 3 year lease.   The pro. Better cabin material,  technology was very advance, cabin noise is low during cruising, car handing was good, technology is not intuitive.The Bad.ABS activation at 24/25 MPH produce 2-3 clicks that driver can feel thru the gas pedal and can be heard by passenger.  Pre-sense is way too sensitive for NYC.  On numerous occasions,  while parallel parking.  The car breaks itself for no reason.  I was going less than 5 MPH with absolutely nothing behind or on the side.   This wouldn\\'t be a problem if it can be permanently disabled but this requires going thru the 5-6 steps in the menu system to disable it every time the car starts.The RMP/throttle seems low when car is in reverse.   While releasing the break in reverse (without stepping on the gas) you can feel the car vibrate as it was going to cut out.  Obviously it doesn\\'t cut out but surely it shouldn\\'t vibrate.Honestly, I felt my switch over from the X3 to Q5 was a bad choice.   I end up paying more on a monthly basis thinking the 2018 Q5 was a step up.  In technology sense it was a step up, but my expectation of the basic car functions was missed.   Bottom line.  New isn\\'t always better.  I think Audi rush the release for the major model change. Nothing like I\\'ve owned before very nice ride Great mileage, plenty of room low cost on upkeep and best of all no issue\\'s with vehicle Excellent Car No complaints, except the price. Everything about the car is over the top luxury and refinement. Bang & Olefson speakers, over the top. Tow capacity, amazing. Acceleration, more than sufficient. Highly recommend Highly recommend, for 4 adults or teenager passengers.  Back seat not adequate for 3 adults.  Q7 better for large family.  However we are a couple & love this vehicle.  Road noise slightly higher than expected but ok. My 2012 Q5 flooded in Harvey so I got another Q5! It has the most stylish lines of any comparable SUV on the market. Handles like a sedan with permanent 4 wheel drive. The 2017 is much quieter than my old 2012 too and with the B&O speakers, that\\'s a plus! Not the Best Do your homework before purchasing this vehichle. Love This Vehicle Purchased Ibis White with Pistachio interior.  Great vehicle to drive and very solid and comfortable. Brakepad Eater? Tire Eater? I wanted this car big-time. I have been researching it, along with the BMW X1, for several months. But I recently learned that a couple of friends I trust have this car. They like it ok, but expressed concerns about the expense of maintaining the brakepads and tires. The X1 is faster -- by a fraction of a second -- if that matters to you a lot. But I have owned 3 BMWs over the years and have found that their engineering is very hard to beat. Add to that that the pricing is much better on the BMW, I think it makes more sense. Awesome Vehicle Incredible style, ride and comfort with a good balance of power and mileage, BUT cost goes up more than mileage savings due to price premium of premium fuel. Looks good, good mileage, but major engine problem I do enjoy driving this SUV; it\\'s comfortable, good looking, and performs well. Instrumentation is overly complicated and requires some study if a driver is older. In the first week of owning it, the car developed a major engine problem that originated on the manufacturer\\'s assembly line. The repair was major, and I was advised by independent engineers that there is no assurance that this car could not have another major problem in the future. The dealer was sympathetic and offered me an Audi Care package and 12,000 new car warranty miles.  They think this should cover my inconvenience, but I have no assurance that this Audi will hold up for the long haul.  I don\\'t think I got what I paid for. Exactly what I was looking for! Shopped around quite a bit for a mid-level luxury car and the Q5 ultimately met all my desires.  A little bit more road noise on the highway than I was expecting but beyond that, the vehicle is awesome!  Luxurious while practical and looks pretty damn good out there on the road. Audi heaven Can\\'t go wrong. Read This First My wife has always wanted an Audi. So when our 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Lease ended we \"Upgraded\" to a 2017 Q5. The vehicle is a disappointment! I wish I could take it back. What we Lost: Remote Start, Touchscreen Infotainment with larger screen, Heated Steering Wheel, USB ports, and half our Trunk Space!  You can\\'t advance songs from the steering wheel, the volume knob is on the far side of the gear shift, & it\\'s a 2 step process to lower the air power. Another annoyance is the wiper blades can\\'t be raised, so cleaning ice and snow off the blades is a chore. Plus, you have to pay for 10k, 20k, and 30k maintenance or spend another $900 for their Audi Care plan. Yes, it\\'s gorgeous and it handles well in the snow, but the infotainment system is overly-complicated.  I\\'ve learned my lesson... Looks aren\\'t everything. It\\'s \"luxury\", but totally impractical. Still loving it. Had my Q5 (2.0 T Premium Plus package) for 17 months now.  I am still really enjoying it and I still love the panoramic sun roof!  It is such a good looking car  -- inside and out.   It is a pleasure to drive.    Remains a  perfect fit for me.   It is not a gas guzzler but does require premium gas which is a bit costly.  It is sporty and in the \"S\" gear has lots of pep.  My only complaints are 1.)  no USD outlets to charge phone (I recently used a 2018 A5 as a loaner and 2 USD outlets were in the center console - very nice - wish I had that);  2.) the front side mirrors are huge and create dangerous blind spots to things like bikes and pedestrians approaching from the side.    Otherwise PERFECT! Luxury interior The interior of the Q5 is much nicer than the BMW X3. Test drove both the 2.0 and the 3.0 six cylinder and unless you need the extra hp, (towing or mountain roads)  the 2.0 four cylinder is plenty. Didn\\'t really want the full sunroof but it shouldn\\'t be an issue in cooler climates. Audi Q5 2.0  Great midsized SUV The Audi Q5 is a great combination of power, handling and fuel economy. It’s very quiet and comfortable. Some quirky controls and electronics. Some knobs are backwards of logic, like up to close and down to open... sometimes radio just doesn’t come one. Just stop and restart car and it’s fine. Weird. YOU AUDI GET AN AUDI I owned 5 Mercedes prior to purchasing my new Audi Q5, so was accustomed to German handling, ride and convenience.  I was concerned about \"trading down\" to a 6-cylinder engine, having owned a MB ML55 AMG, far and away the best vehicle I\\'d ever owned.  The Q5 is definitely a match, stride-for-stride, much to my surprise.  My two first impressions in the vehicle were \"fit and finish\" in the interior and the sound system by Bang and Olafsen---they were my \"deciders.\"  Now, after 4 years of Audi ownership, I\\'d again cite the fit and finish, the sound system, but would add the quiet ride, the confidence I have in the vehicle, and the support I have received from the dealership\\'s service department.  Owning the Q5 has been a very positive experience.  On the negative side of the ledger has been, of course, the tremendous depreciation, which I suppose is common to all highline vehicles.  I experienced that with the Mercedes, and am so doing with the Q5, despite the excellent care it has received from both the dealership and me.  Whether I get another Audi or something else depends on the deal when I go looking----lots of badges are good, but this has been a good experience.  I have recommended Audi to a number of friends and have sold more than a couple to others. Hits the Sweet Spot I\\'m a picky person. I\\'ve driven many different types of cars, trucks and SUVs in my lifetime (I\\'m in my fifties) and have never really owned a vehicle that I would say hit the ideal sweet spot or did just about everything.  But the Q5 does just that for me. Interior: beautifully laid out with comfortable seats for the long ride and leather surfaces where the leather looks new all the time with no cracks because Audi does not stretch the leather. Electronics take awhile to learn but are fairly intuitive. Exterior: very German, very nice lines, turns heads. Ride:  smooth and comfortable. Ignore all those reviews that talk about the suspension being overly stiff. I wouldn\\'t even use the word \"stiff\" to describe it. Yes, it is firmer than a Lexus or a Buick but those cars are just too soft and feel like minivans to me. The Audi feels sportier and absorbs the bumps nicely but you are still connected to the road. Handling: steering is precise or sloppy and cornering is very good unlike other SUVs with some body roll when entering an interchange which is not unusual for the height of this car or class. I have not driven in the snow yet so cannot comment but rain was very good. Power: very responsive and great acceleration off the block and at passing speeds. More power than you would ever need. Can tow up to 4,400 pounds which is very good. Safety: Excellent ratings by the government and top safety pick by IIHS. The blind spot indicators on large mirrors are very helpful. Disappointments: the lumbar seating adjustment could be a bit firmer for me, but not too bad. Could have more storage for spare change (I use the ash try which is very small). The phone charging takes place in the glove compartment so your phone is not handy although it is connected through bluetooth. I know, safer that way but I like to be able to grab my phone when I need to. 2015 Audi Q5 - almost living the dream. This has been a great vehicle. Virtually everything I could want in a car. However, a few small details keep it from being perfect. I have had 4 recalls on this SUV.  The cargo space is somewhat limited with the 2nd row seats in use. So far the value has been good, but I\\'ll know more when I trade it in. The technology falls a little short. Friends have a BMW 5 series and have heads up display which this SUV does not have. Solid car Car drives well, very quiet inside. Turbo definitely lags. Seats are very comfortable. Best sunroof I\\'ve ever had on a car. Overall very happy with the car. A little less happy with the resale value after 3 years and low miles, though haven\\'t compared it to similar vehicles. Bought my leased Audi Q5 The only complaint I have is the difficulty and steps to use the MMI. Happy repeat customer Love everything about this and looking forward to the 2018. Great car! We did a lot of research before buying this car.  We drove Volvos, BMWs, and Subarus. The Q5 hit the right note on all points and was the perfect combination of style, comfort and pick up.  Highly recommend. Is 5 recalls in 3 years enough? This is my 3rd Q5 and the quality is way down from previous models. 5 recalls and a completely frozen steering column needing to be towed out of a parking lot were enough. And now they make them in Mexico?? A fine automobile My few issues with my Audi are that it\\'s not as quiet a ride as I would hope, especially on the highway: too much air & road noise, so that listening to music is moot. Of course, when you\\'re driving long distances (on highways) is when you want to listen to music!  There is also a hesitancy when trying to enter a highway from a stop or slow speed - you jam the gas pedal to the floor and the engine takes a couple seconds to respond.  Like it\\'s saying to itself, \"I think he wants us to go now, so let\\'s get going.\"  Not good.  Once engaged by the transmission, the 2.0 has enough pickup, so it\\'s not the engine.  It\\'s the transmission engagement that is slow. Lastly, it used hi-test gas (91 octane or higher), which makes it more expensive to run, as it only gets around 15+mpg combined.    That all said, it is a very well built automobile in materials, construction, and detail.  Most certainly better quality automobile than ANY of the Asian imports.  Oh... yeah... it stops on a dime! Very nice crossover 3.0 V6 is notably quicker, smoother, quieter than the four cylinder 2.0. Unfortunately, like most German cars, the engine size drives the price up!  But the engine usually accompanied by a couple of other \"nice to have\" sport features help you rationalize the difference.   I\\'ve always been a \"coupe\" guy, but in my current situation, I\\'m drawn to a moderate sized cross-over SUV.  Therefore, I wish it had a little smoother ride and less body lean in turns.  However, I\\'m quite pleased with my choice of the Q5, but now wonder about an SQ5.  Nicer yet!  Waiting on new model update expected in 2018. One Year Review The Audi Q5 was my dream car, and I was very impressed with it for the first few months. It has been about a year now, and I have less than 9000 miles on it, but I have slowly become less fond of the vehicle. I have had a rattle in the driver\\'s side door fixed once already, but it has come back. I have another rattle coming from the cargo space cover, that makes noise every time I go over a bump, such as speed bump or when pulling into driveways. There also seems to be another rattle coming from the seat belt mount on the driver side. The sun visors will not stay up when moved up to the windshield. Living in Florida, I use the visors daily, but the quickly fall about 2 inches when put them up, which Audi has told me is \"normal.\"  I have owned Chevy, GMC, Mitsubishi, Kia and Jeep, and have never encountered a problem with the sun visors staying in place.     It also seems that Audi has gone out of its way to ensure that the base model ($42,000) has as few features as possible IE: radio and electronics. Radio presets can only be operated from the dashboard, not on the steering wheel, and no back-up camera, which is basically standard on all vehicles in this day and age. Overall, I don\\'t dislike the car, but I doubt that I will spend the money on another Audi once my lease is up. I know some of the issues are petty, but for the price, I suppose I expected higher quality. The perfect little SUV!! Very nice car, not to big, not to small. Very quiet inside, very good power, nice tight car!  We tested others like Cadillac, Lexus, Mercedes Benz, Honda and the grand Cherokee, for our needs, the Q5 was best, and for all the extras, price was good. Q5 Large mirrors causes driver blind spots- I am leasing this car.  It is my first Audi.  My husband loves his Audi so I thought I would try one after driving a Mercedes GL 450 for 2 years.  It has only been 2 months. and I hate this car. My 2  biggest complaints.  The side mirrors are HUGE.  So big, that it causes major blind spots. Very dangerous.  I have seen many complaints of this issue online and disappointed Audi has not responded to fix. When you are at an intersection, making a left, the mirror will cause a blind spot to the cars (median or island) of the street you are entering. I would not buy this car because of this safety issue.   The sensors in the front and back of  the car  are also way to sensitive and will start to beep when are you are no where close to hitting something.   So sensitive,  I find them to be more of a distraction and ignore the beeps.  So what\\'s the purpose when you start tuning it out? Audi Q5 2015 TDI I purchased this SUV with 14000 miles on it and got a fairly sizable discount from original sticker from the dealer.   I have owned three BMW 535I (one was a 530) previous to this vehicle so I am know what I am talking about performance wise  as two had Sport suspensions.  This Audi does have all the upgrades including the 20 inch wheels and handles extremely well for a smallish 4500 pound SUV.  The acceleration of 6.5 seconds to 60 is amazing for a diesel that has ranged between 30 and 39 miles per gallon so far. I have noticed that the temperature conditions affect the mileage which must be a diesel thing but recently I got 39.5 MPG driving to Chicago on a 70 degree day going Northbound maybe I had a tail wind who knows.   In summary the handling, acceleration , and mileage are ABSOLUTELy splendid.  Certainly some of the 500 HP sport model SUV\\'s are faster but who wants to own a vehicle that gets 15MPG average?I have not had one issue after four months and 9000 miles and  the car is extremely quiet under highway driving conditions.My only complaints are the short warranty period of 50000 miles accompanied by 2600 in \"regular maintanence\"  costs  and the center console which impedes the movement of my right leg a bit. The lack of a few  electronic options is really nothing I can not live without like I need more distractions while I am whipping down the highway.  I will let you know if anything goes wrong I am hoping to actually be able to drive a German vehicle for 150K carefree miles which was impossible with a BMW. I can not imagine an Acura or Lexus handling anywhere near as well so if you like performance with economy the TDI is the wave of the future. Multiple Repairs over the First Year. Purchased the car with 2000 miles on it.  At first drove like charm.  Within 2 months, front grille peeled requiring replacement.  Three months later, needed another grille due to peeling.  After this repair visit noticed shuddering and bucking with acceleration on inclines.  Took car in and was told needed a new fuel injector.  The car had less than 15000 miles.  Injector replaced.  Took car from dealer and before I could get home, problem started again.  After exam was told was fuel related and should try different stations.  A month later, after trying every station in my city, problem still existed and took car back to dealer for closer look.  After several days of exam, car was diagnosed with severe carbon build up in engine.  A shame such a nice car has so many issues. I\\'m done with Audi. Great Ride, but a few issues! I have had my 2015 Audi Q5 for about a year now, replacing a 2009 Acura RDX which I loved.   The Audi is beautifully finished, and an extremely comfortable vehicle.   I have had minor issues with rattles and noises, including having to change the hinges on the rear passenger door.   In also long for some of the technology that I had in my 2009 Acura, like knowing the tire pressure in each tire.  I also find the blue-tooth entertainment system unfriendly to use, and the audio response quite poor.   Frequently, the numbers are wrong.  You can say \"six\" and end up with a seven in the number.  Handling is good, though the electronic steering takes some time to get used to.  I miss the tightness (& lower body roll ) of the Acura, but over time have gotten to where I really like my Audi.Last, for a 2015 model, the interface with your mobile phone is horrid.   The Hyundai Sonata  unfortunately has a better interface than the Audi.   If you are looking for a good, comfortable car, this one is for you.   If you are looking for \"technology\", the Audi may not be your vehicle. I LOVE MY AUDI Female, in my early 20\\'s and I love my Audi Q5! I have put a few thousand miles (still under 20k) on this Audi so far and bought the Audi Care with it, brand new. I love the sound system, the navigation system, the buttons, the lights, the controls, the handling, and the traction. The performance on sport mode is phenomenal, I hit over 120mph and it handled amazingly well at such high speeds! I have drove it through rain, gravel, grass, dirt, not *yet snow.... Excellent handling! Very sleek and fancy interior, my favorite thing is the sunroof. I don\\'t have any kids, but I would assume the back seat is average, not large or too small. I travel a lot, it goes for an average of 450 miles before needing another fill up. There is so much technology I have yet to figure out everything, but the more I learn the more I love it! Cheap interior parts, avoid vaccum I\\'ve been a Ford owner for over 30 years from sedans to pickups very satisfied. First Audi Q5 bought with 30,000 miles on it now has 80,000 a year later to give you an idea of the miles I Drive. Overall was satisfied until had an issue with a vacuum ripping off a part on my console. Audi will not sell me that individual part for $20 they bundle it with the entire consol for  $300 dealer said it was my problem to go online and see if I could find the individual part itself. I then called the national Audi customet service and did not get any better service there. very disappointing. I won\\'t own another Audi. Im going back to Ford or Lincoln. Someone should buy the senior management team at Audi copies of the book raving fans their customer service is horrible Love this car! Not too big and not too small, perfect size SUV for me. Handling is great, nav tech can be improved (needs to be more intuitive but I have adapted), overall great ride.Bang and Oluf upgrade has awesome surround sound preferences.Its been 6 months, 2 long road trips with mountain driving, no flat tires or any other issues.I was worried about compact trunk space but my medium dog fits fine along with my groceries/travel baggage. A driver\\'s SUV If you want an objective review, read Edmunds own. Compair to Accura RDX, Volvo   XC60, BMW X3 and MB GLK350.  Own a 2014 Q5 with 24000 miles, two trips from Florida to Boston and zero problems to date.  AC is great, MMI is difficult but once mastered it becomes somewhat intuitive.  Needs to be simplified.   Bad position of the Cruise Control stalk.  Confusing, gets mixed up with Turn Signal at times.  Need to move controls on the steering wheel. ( Are you listening Audi? )  Would I buy again?  In a heart beat. Ride is great, MMI is TERRIBLE!!! I\\'m coming up on a year with the Q5.  I love the ride, it sits well, and handles well in the snow.  Unfortunately, the MMI system that controls the navigation and entertainment is TERRIBLE!!!!!  It is not intuitive, it is both on the steering wheel (IF you can figure out which dial to roll) and has a small joystick on the console.  It is way too confusing, too distracting, there is no touch screen and overtime I try to use it I get frustrated.  The book doesn\\'t help at all because a lot of things aren\\'t in there or aren\\'t explained clearly.  The system is so bad that it colors my entire feelings about the car. So far, so good for the most part Have had a 2015 Q5 3.0T for five months and 2K miles now.  It\\'s the S-line with MMI and the B&O stereo.  I love the looks, the comfortable seats, the panoramic roof and the smooth and torquey engine.  Quattro and the 8 speed transmission make for a nice, fairly refined drivetrain.  Zero issues to date but it\\'s early.  \\r As for negatives the B&O isn\\'t much of a premium stereo and sorely lacks both overall volume and bass.  The MMI is overly complicated and just OK.  The back seat could be a bit roomier but is not terrible by any means.  The cargo area doesn\\'t seem as roomy as I would have hoped.  Curb weight at around 4400 lbs is excessive.  The engine runs out of power a bit at higher rpms Audi Q5 - 6 month review - Tires:  3 flat tires in 6 months when I have never had a flat prior.  No full size space.  OEM tires already discontinued after 6 months.  I now have one tire that does not match and Audi has said I need to replace all the tires if I want them to match although Audi does not recommend driving with tires that do not match.  Audi customer service (awful!) said it would not replace the tires, then said it would (I have a voicemail), then said it would not.....\\r- Actual highway MPG has been 22-23 versus posted 28.  I care about vehicle range hence why this matters for me.  \\r- Rattling in the winter.  Constant rattles that went away when temperatures warmed up.   Fun to drive, electronics are a hassle This turbo SUV is a blast to drive. The leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter feel expensive.  Does great in the snow with factory tires. Backup camera peeps when in Reverse if there is something in front of the car (so not helpful). Too many clicks to do simple things like change the radio station or climate control. Overly complicated electronics (I came from a Lexus RX). Put this engine in a Lexus and I would go back in a heartbeat.Update 3/2017 - drove over Eisenhower pass in Colorado and the transmission popped out of gear several times (this is an automatic). Dealer was clueless. Sold car shortly after. Not interested in a new car that expensive giving me headaches. Also one random time the locked driver\\'s door popped open while driving. 2015 Q5 Premium Plus 2.0T I upgraded from a 2003 BMW x5 to the 2015 Q5.  I considered the BMW x5, x3 as well.\\r Dollar for dollar the Audi wins.\\r Its nicely appointed, peppy and fast, roomy where it needs to be but not more room than you need.  (need more go Q7).  \\r In 2014 the roof rack was notoriously noisy when installed and you needed to get after market wind suppressors.  2015 roof rack now comes standard with them  (manufacturer actually listened!)  Again your choice to install roof rack if desired, the just bolt basically with included tool.\\r Very stylish, LED lights are awesome, great on fuel, fun to drive and has enough space for all my hobbies!\\r Love this SUV!  Love the full Pano sunroof!!\\r The Q5 Diesel Is Superb Glad to finally be done with the great dieselgate debacle. Even after the modifications, the car gets excellent mileage (lost about 1 MPG), and all of its terrific low end torque is intact. Audi really knows how to put a car together. The layout of the cabin is gorgeous. The Audi service people are top notch. Shame it has no Apple CarPlay. This car is a pure pleasure to drive, and has never given me one bit of trouble. Don\\'t hesitate to buy this diesel. After two years with this 2015 Audi Q5 TDI , I have only one word...incredible. I\\'ve never owned a diesel car before...the combination of power, torque and gas mileage cant be beat. Most Americans are now leery of Audi diesel\\'s ...perfect .. Go buy one at incredible bargain rates. This Audi diesel is by far the best selling model throughout Europe, and for good reason. This sophisticated and quiet diesel engine is pure Audi ...through & through. I had the emission \"fix\" done on the car , and now enjoy an extended 100,000 mile warranty with clean emissions, and the car still retains all the power & torque & gas mileage I\\'ve grown accustomed to.  ... this engine is way more sophisticated and clean burning than the 4 cylinder VW engines that have been in the news. I wish I had stuck with the Acura The car seems to ride OK  except for the steering wheel which seems very loose.   I find it particularly difficult to control in high winds  or at high-speeds.  The acceleration is fantastic  as is the breaking.   The ride is sort of smooth but the tires don\\'t seem to provide much in the way of comfort than you would expect. For the price point of this car, the stereo system is abysmal.  It is like listening to music in a tin can.   My mistake was not checking that out before hand.   Assumed it this day and age and at this price point that he would be as good as the Acura\\'s. When I took it in to find out if there is anything  I was so much is told that it can\\'t compare.   So I took it to an expert who told me it would cost me no less than 1500 to make it sound halfway decent.  The whole navigation system seems OK just a bit complicated.  Making phone calls is equally complicated.   I\\'m going to wait until I get a few thousand more miles on it and then I\\'m going to trade it in.   I would not recommend this car  particularly for this price. Q5 TDI Perfect family crossover So far with 7500 miles the Q5 has been great. Plenty of power, great gas mileage, very comfortable around town and on the highway. Good value for cost of ownership. Hope to keep it in our family for a long time. Audacious Audi The vehicle at this point (4K miles) exceeds my expectations ! The drive is excellent and the interior technology is well crafted and fun. My take on the car is that I\\'ve purchased an SUV, with all the advantages of cargo space, passenger room etc.,that performs like a sports car. The panoramic roof is fantastic, I love that feature. But most of all I like the power and stability of the ride on the open road. In fact my favorite moments are merely cruising along the highway and just reveling at the quiet, yet powerful nature of its ride. NOT COOL IN THE DESERT!! The sunroof is so hot. The shade doesn\\'t stop the heat from your head and the AC does not cool the cab to comfort. Bad AC!! Shame on you Audi. I expected better for what we paid. Brakes Screech known issue with no resolution The brakes have been screeching since 5,000 miles.  Called Audi Care and representative said it is a known issue with no remedy.  I will never buy or lease another Audi.  Horrible product and response from Audi.  I cannot wait for my lease to ends.  Do not purchase or lease this vehicle. Q5 3.0 Just bought a 2013 Audi Q5 3.0.  Great to drive and lots of power.  Has all the luxury items and is very fun and good looking.  Only issue is backup camera which is not working properly - will come on sometimes for a second but then shuts off.  We\\'ll see how the dealer will handle. New to me - I love it! UPDATE - I\\'ve had my Audi for 13 months now and I still love it. I just took it to the beach for a trip with my (adult) kids. We crammed her full that\\'s for sure, but even with the extra weight she had some get up and go. She handles lovely around the windy road corners. Things I notice this time of year are: she\\'s quick to defrost, the seat warmers are a godsend, she heats up nicely - gets toasty warm inside. Gas mileage is great. She\\'s easy to park. I also love the seat memory button so I can get her right back to my favorite after valet drivers move the seat.I have only had this car since 12/28, but three weeks in and I can tell you it\\'s a much nicer ride than my old Highlander. The cabin feels a lot smaller, but the car is much smaller than what I had before.  The responsiveness is awesome. And can I just tell you, the automatic downhill assist saved my life? We had a huge snow storm here and I live at the bottom of a serious hill; downhill assist got me home safely. It kind of takes over the braking and all you have to do is steer. Made me feel much safer driving in snowy conditions. When I can get new tires I\\'ll bet it will be even better!  All in all I\\'m really happy I bought this car. 2013 audi q5 3.0t premium plus s-line Great vehicle.  0 issues since we bought the Q5.  Purchased used from dealership with 12000 miles.  Audi service has been outstanding.Came prepaid with scheduled maintainence plan from previous owners... Thank You!Wife primary driver and commutes many miles for work.2 young children are the occupants for the rear seats.  Forward and rear facing child seats fit no problem.Only complaint is MMI.  And why is there not a separate (lone) button to control fan speed for HVAC?! 2013 Audi Q5 3.0T Premium Plus S-line Currently at 24,000 miles with  no problems (knock on wood). The car is a great blend of luxury, performance, Audi & S-line styling, and daily function. The attention to fit and finish really delivers a first-class roomy/quiet driving experience. I previously owned a Q5 2.0T. I was really surprised  at the difference in the 3.0T engine - SO satisfying! While the 2.0T is an excellent engine, I did notice some turbo-lag. A five-time winner of Ward\\'s 10 best engines, the 3.0L TFSI supercharged V-6 brings joyful acceleration with a flat-torque line (272 hp @ 4,780 rpm; 295 lb-ft; 0-60: 5.8 sec) – it really inspires! The 8-speed Tiptronic transmission is silky smooth. Panoramic sunroof 14-speaker B&O sound & rear view camera  are all very nice. Four passengers fit very comfortably; though five is a bit squeeze. Ample cargo space; we have no trouble loading up for camping trips - You can fit a couple mountain bikes in the rear, but the best option is a hitch or roof carrier. With 50/50 city/highway driving using premium 93 Shell V-power, my Q5 is gets 20-22 mpg. All highway definitely better; recent 600 mile trip managed 30 mpg. 3.0T Premium Plus S-Line Excellent balance of luxury and performance. Surprisingly roomy in passenger compartment and trunk despite small footprint of vehicle. For premium price of q5, missing some features I had on previous car (see below in suggested improvements). MMI despite improved, still makes it cumbersome to change radio station. No preset buttons means having to scroll on MMI controller or scroll wheel on the steering wheel. Two memory seat positions but still requires you to manually adjust steering wheel each time you change drivers. The panoramic moonroof affords lots of light and view. Drives and handles superbly with the S-Line package. The flat-bottom steering wheel looks and feels great. 2013 Audi Q5 2.0 - Good so far Have owned it for over a month now. The quality of interior and exterior is very good. The turbo responds well . I like the paddle shifters and the ability to temporarily switch to manual from automatic by using the paddle shifters when you need that extra power. The car is very easy to handle and responds well. But I am disappointed by the mpg. I am supposed to get 20/28 but I am getting 17 with 25% freeway / 75% city combination . I was hoping to get 21/22 at a minimum . I use premium gas (93) and I have already tried 3 different gas stations ( Exxon, Mobil, Sams). Do difference so far. I sold my MDX that was giving me 15 mpg for (25% freeway / 75% city combination ) and now I get 17 :( . Great Vehicle in all ways but one I purchased the 2013 Premium-Plus in October, 2012 and now have ten thousand miles and can give an objective overview.Love the vehicle, the fit and finish is exceptional.It\\'s quiet, quick, nimble and tight when driving.The suspension is quite nice, not to rough and no bounce whatsoever.The only complaint is that the multimedia system is dated for a 2013 model, especially in this class segment.  Nice Car Bought the 2.0T Premium Plus, with Navigation, 19\" wheels and B+O Stereo in December 2012. The Edmunds review is dead on - this is a well-built, agile and luxurious car. I have a few nit-picks : the MMI system has a number of quirks - for example, upon startup, the car will reset the volume level (even if previously muted) and revert music playback to the beginning of the track that was playing when you parked, as opposed to the point in the track where you left off , which seems pointless to me;also, the gas mileage has been less than the EPA figures (but I suppose many cars share that trait).That being said, the joy of driving makes up forthese grumbles. 2013 Q5 2.0T Quattro Bought it December 28, 2012. convenience package. Amazing car, i do not miss my last two 4Runners(03,11), love to drive that Crossover, great look, gas mileage is decent (91, 93), tiptronic is so cool, fun driving on manual or automatic sport or just D. Came with Michelin tires, do not have nav but the screen for radio and blue tooth is the same look and size.Heated leather seat. takes time to know all the set up inside the car, just be patient you are in a Audi. Now i don\\'t mind beeing stuck in traffic:) 2010 Auid Q5 Quattro Premium 3.2 V6 This is by far the best car I have ever owned. My previous car was a Land Rover LR2 which had the best ride of any car even better than the Audi. However i love the Audi. great gas mileage, lots of power and it is very reliable. Have had it for one year and bought it at 90k miles, it now has 104k miles. The only issue that I have had is the Panoramic sunroof fabric shade. I retracted it all the way and now it is stuck there. I guess what happens is the strips glued on to the underside of the fabric that the retracting motor uses to retract it, came unglued.  It is something that I will fix myself since have that ability and there is a good youtube video for it. But if you are considering buying a used Audi Q5 go for it, itis an excellent car! Car I s good but repair is expensive I Wii prefer to buy any Japanese car instead of German car. $ Bang for your Buck $ I\\'ve owned and sold several Audi Q5\\'s over the years.  I think the 2010 model type is one of the most dependable and overall well rounded versions of this car available.  the newer smaller displacement, forced induction engines with he 8speed transmission are nice, and the gas millage is better but the reliability is worrisome and costly.  Of course you should purchase ANY luxury/GERMAN vehicle with concerns regarding maintenance and price, because it will happen eventual on any make/model at any time.  Having said that, Audi\\'s are by far the best value in class.  they are more sporty than their counterparts with a younger more sleek feeling.  The 2010 Q5 drive smooth and easy at low speeds, and is tight and responsive at high speeds.  the car feels as good to drive as it looks going down the road for thousands less than its competitors, or a new model for that matter.  buy one with a few miles for under 20K and you will have a good car for years to come, so long as you get the maintenance plan as well! very well put together, inside and out. Have enjoyed driving this car Trade in and resale values don\\'t hold My 6 year old 2010 Audi Q5 3.2 Totally Undriveable It\\'s a beauty on the outside, but mechanically if you buy one anything can go wrong.  Sure my car had 91,000 miles on it and had Carfax Service records.  So far after owning it for only 6 months, it\\'s already has had to have a complete front end re-done,  hoses replaced, they still can\\'t figure out what\\'s wrong with the steering that \\'chatters\\' when you turn to the left that was $3,000 worth of work.  But what has happened now is that I was noticing the anti-freeze disappearing but no leaking.  The oil cap was milky which meant the antifreeze was leaking into the engine and you could watch it disappearing.  I had the car towed to the Audi mechanic.  The warranty I bought for $3,000 isn\\'t worth the paper it\\'s written on, they have loop holes in it so they don\\'t have to fix it.  Basically the engine needs to be replaced.  According to the mechanic the engine is so difficult to disassemble and tons of man hours and dollars, it\\'s easier to replace than taking it apart.  So now I have no car to drive.  I have over the years owned used cars from Mercedes to BMW\\'s and have never had a problem with high miles.  This car is a joke.  My only resolve is to turn it back into the bank and then I will be stuck with the residual to pay for years.  Anyone have any ideas? Or heard of this kind of car tragedy? Update:  The dealership refuses to do anything about it.  The credit union can\\'t do anything about it.  How can they in all consciousness sell you a car that is a lemon?UPDATE:The car ended up having $7k worth of work to get the thing running again.  It then started to over heat.  I had to turn the car back into my bank and I had to take a hit on my credit because of it.  I wasn\\'t about to pay over $25k for a car that kept breaking down.  I called the Audi Corporate office, of course nothing they could or would do so Audi lovers beware, there are bad cars out there that will break you!  Other Audi owners of this model and make have made the same comments to me (I ask when I see one) no good engines in these cars.  I loved the look of it, the way it handled etc.  but their engines suck!  Thanks Audi for ruining my credit!! Love my Audi! First time Audi owner and absolutely love the Q5. Great gas mileage, about 27 miles on highway with premium gas. No problems with the vehicle to date. Excellent paint job and easy to keep clean. Highly recommend this vehicle.  Love my Q5 I have had my 2010 for a little over a year. I only had oneproblem with it and that was three weeks ago. The water pump went while I was driving. My husband came and had the suv towed on a flat bed to the dealer we bought it from. They told him they had no idea why the water pump went (not common on 3.2 engines). They told my husband to wait and fixed it right then and there.Now that is service. It is great on the road it hugs it. Great miles on the highway driving. I would buy another one in a heart beat. No regrets. Better than BMW I used to drive a 2008 BMW X5 and didn\\'t like the performance, comfort, quality, reliability, etc. The Audi Q5 is more than what I expected, especially the way it handles the road on an extreme condition, the way it accelerates when passing, driving uphill is like driving on a straight road. The only thing I didn\\'t like about the Audi Q5 is the way it drives under 10 mph. Overall, the best SUV I\\'ve ever driven, better than the BMW X5 So Far, So great I bought my Q5Premium Plus this month after going back and forth with the car dealer trying to get a better deal with the 2011\\'s out.  I was finally able to get the vehicle at almost $4000 off the sticker.  I have only driven 1200 miles, but so far I love the vehicle. On a weekend trip, I got between 26-27 MPG which I feel is excellent. I suggest that you wax the 19\" wheels with a good wax. The brake dust will still show up, but it will wash off much easier.  Overall I will rate this vehicle a 10. I will write again in about 6 months.  Audi q5 in a rain storm Just got back from driving on route 91 in a terrible rain  and wind   storm. Today was another  example of why I purchased  an Audi SUV.  It holds the road so well and just feels very safe to drive; especially under bad driving conditions. 2 months in I wrote an earlier review and don\\'t have much to add; I thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and am very happy with the choice. I do have some observations: my wife, who is 5\\' 2\" drove my car one time and really disliked the oversize side mirrors as they obscured her view; I am 6\\'1\" and haven\\'t had that problem so maybe it\\'s an issue only for smaller stature folks. If I could change one thing it still would be opting for all-season radials instead of the summer performance tires. Also, a minor beef: the rear view camera takes a few moments to initialize so I find I\\'m having to wait after hopping in and cranking the ignition before I can begin to back up. All in all a great car!  Q5 exceeds expectations Purchased the 2010 Q5 about 5 weeks ago and this vehicle has exceeded all my expectations.  It rides and handles beautifully.  It feels very safe and stable and can stop on a dime. The interior is also quite impressive. It just looks and feels great. Really nice to drive after a long day at work.  Averaging 26 mpg between 20% city and 80% highway driving.  Overall, I would not hesitate to purchase another Q5 if anything ever happens to this one.   New Q Just bought my Q5 a month ago and I love it. Very solidly built. I am really enjoying the \"Smart Key\" feature. I also am a fan of the MMI; though it\\'s not really what I would call \"intuitive\", it hasn\\'t been all that hard to adapt to. I love that I can make and take phone calls, navigate through the onscreen menu, adjust climate, etc, without having to \"reach\" for any controls. Complaints? It does seem to accelerate somewhat unevenly at very low speeds; room in the backseat is also tight--I\\'m 6 ft 1 in so when I drive, someone sitting behind me won\\'t have much legroom---fortunately that rarely happens! GREAT looking car. I\\'ll review again in 6 months. Hated Crossovers until this! I\\'m a sedan guy for a family ride, and when it came time for my wife to look for a new car I tried like heck to stay away from the SUV-Crossover segment. After driving the Q5 I have become a convert.  The Q5 is a wonderful driving machine, precise in its handling (once you get used to the size) and surprisingly good in the twisties.  Just got back from a road trip down to San Fran and I was very impressed.  The overall feel of quality and competence in the way the Audi goes about its business is flat out impressive.   I\\'ve got a 3.0TDI diesel! Hey you guys in the US, I had to wait 6 months to get my 3.0TDI to Australia, and I can tell you at last that it was well worth the wait. The diesel power is very different to the 3.2 version. It comes as more of of a  surge, rather than the instant zippy power of a petrol motor, but when it surges, it just seems to keep producing more and more power! I chose this over the 3.2 because it is more economical and has even faster acceleration. (0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds. I won\\'t add to the comments others have already made about the build quality and driving pleasure as I\\'m sure this has already been covered, just wanted you all to know that the diesel is a monster! Awesome Audi! This is my first Audi and I absolutely love it! I have owned several other vehicles including BMW, Volvo, etc., and this car is far above the rest. If you are thinking of any other vehicle in this class, I highly recommend a long test drive and you will be convinced.  Best Crossover SUV  Traded in my BMW X5 and haven\\'t looked back.  Eye catching exterior and interior design, comfortable ride, good acceleration exiting ramps, quality build throughout.   First German Car After years of Japanese vehicles I transitioned to that which I always wanted.  Was set up to buy an A-4 but wanted a little utility and was willing to compromise on performance.  So far very happy with features and performance.   Audi Rocks Replaced my 2008 Honda Pilot. I had leased A4 in 2005 and was very happy with Audi as a brand. Great car/SUV. Love it, of course smaller than Honda Pilot but works for me. Positive German Experience This is my first German car and it\\'s a great one - beautifully finished, good mix of power and economy, and reasonably fun handling.  I sold a Mini Cooper to upsize to the Q5 and don\\'t regret it a bit.  The quality is first-rate and my wife feels safer in a larger vehicle with outstanding crash test results.   The Best Compact SUV in the Market It was love at first sight!  From the moment I saw the Q5 I knew that\\'s what I wanted and had been waiting for.  I had already made a deal on a BMW X3, but I was not 100% convinced that I liked the car, particular the stiff ride.  I drive a lot.  Every week-end I\\'m on the road and driving my Q5 is a dream come true!  It is just pure pleasure!  I love how the cockpit looks when it gets dark.   Design flaw During snow or rain, when the rear hatch is opened, to gain access to the rear compartment, water, snow, dirt and salt build up in the drain channel and then run into the rear compartment. I\\'ve seen the mess run over the rubber seal. The dealer said they cannot do anything but maybe Audi will contact me and see if the problem can be solved. To date, no additional contact. Best SUV I have Owned I LOVE my new Audi Q5.  Its Comfortable, handles great and is so easy to drive.  No problems since I purchased.  Service Department is Awesome.  I will Definitely purchase another Audi for wifes next vehicle.  Thank you AUDI Great Job. Best crossover Replaced my 2009 Murano.  This crossover rides so much better. More responsive steering.  Handling around curves much better.  Quieter on the highway.  Less obstructed rearward view.  Interior much finer albeit a tad bit smaller.  The Audi doesn\\'t quite match the cargo space of the Murano, but I don\\'t miss it.  I do wish the gas mileage was a little better, but this is after all a crossover not a car. Star Performance We recently purchased a 2010 Q5 Premium Plus at Classic Audi and absolutely love it. It handles very well and commands the road. Good car but not perfect Side mirrors are too big and create large blind spots.  I needed to take car in to have transmission \"reprogrammed\" in second week of owning the car. otherwise, Q5 is a good car.   New Audi Q5 (Premier) first impression I have had my Q5 for one month (1300 miles).  Moved up from 2005 Subaru Outback XT (turbo).  The car feels bigger than it is (probably high hood), but the handling is superb. Nice turn radius, positive/stable in twisties, and smooth/fast acceleration.  Steering feels 1:1 and no issue.  Noted comment on hesitation from stop to start; haven\\'t experienced this. Shifting smooth all the way up; sport mode is RESPONSIVE. Interior is beautiful. MMI and voice work, but there is a learning curve: reading instruction book helps!  It is more expensive than the Suby (for the money, very good value). But if a luxury compact SUV is your thing, then the Q5 is an excellent choice; I highly recommend the Q5. Audi-be better Beautiful car but has flaws... 1) The navigation system:  does not allow searching for a restaurant type.  for instance you cannot ask for Chinese, Mexican or Italian food - you just get a list of restaurants that includes everything from \"taco bell\" to \"chez panesse\". 2) The brake pads spew dark dust that spray the side of the car daily.  There are no mud-flaps to prevent overspray from the front wheels so the side of my car is covered in break dust from the wheels daily. 3) Who uses dvd\\'s? Get rid of the dvd player. 4) Who uses an ashtray? Get rid of the ashtray or at least make it larger so it can be used to hold a cell phone or business cards - its a useless space.  Good Car This car is wonderful. For a car this small you think it would be cramped but it\\'s not. A definite buy Exellent Vehicle I have driven lots of cars, and this one takes the cake. Handling and overall performance are better then my wife\\'s A4, and it has much more cargo capacity. Fun to drive & different among the crowd I purchased the 2010 with the prestige S line package. So far I love to drive it and there are no problems.Only difficulty is operating the MMI. But once you get used to it, it\\'s not too bad.   Best Car ever This vehicle is the pinnacle of luxury. It outperforms anything else I have driven. Its ride is unique, firm but smooth at the same time. It\\'s a definite buy. nice driving poor reliability When I bought mi Q5 prestige, I was very happy but all the problems started.A/C broke down twice, dealership had to replace to parts on both headlights,leak on the transmission etc etc.Nice looking car, fun to drive POOR RELIABILITY. TRADED IN FOR A LEXUS. Audi Q5 front LED light broken 3 times I am reporting review AUDI Q5  (year of 2010) because the front daylight headlight running sets problems, I purchased an AUDI Q5 in 9/23/2009, it happened 3 times of front headlight daylight running sets broken in 5 months, my car\\'s current mileage is only 5700 mile, which is apparently not the LED headlight quality problem, which is highly possible on the electrical problems, now I am waiting for AUDI\\'s response to see they will treat it as a lemon car case or not. Great SUV I had a Q5 Premium plus with S-line package, had this vehicle for almost 2 weeks now & I will say that this is the best car I ever had. Day time running LED lights makes a cool stylish appearance. Ride is great & quite, car keeps on lane with very little steering effort. Interior fit & finish is excellent. MMI nav is not really user friendly, but once used will be ok, would love if have touch screen.. The display on meter shows the songs list & tel numbers without interfering nav screen is great. I would definitely recommend any one looking to buy a compact SUV to drive this car. Great Car! We drive our Q5 in the LA area and love it! It\\'s good looking, quick, quiet and fun!  Great SUV This is by far the best SUV in this size and price range. We test drove the XC60, RX350, GLK350, X3, SRX and the RDX. The Q5 comes out on top quality wise.  Very nice with a few caveats... Overall, the Q5 is a wonderful driving experience. I live up north and it handles extremely well in the snow. Very comfortable and pleasant to drive.  However, there are issues. The nav system, although nice looking, gives unreliable directions. I use my $180 portable instead.  And the key. How do you screw up an ignition key?  The MMI (multi media) system is nice but forgets your settings. Stupid things like always having to tell it to \"shuffle\" the music - every time you use it it requires 4 clicks. It also forgets your seat heater settings. Also, with the MMI buttons on the middle console, its very easy to accidentally touch one.  Why doesn\\'t it have a touch screen???!! Wow, really the best car! WOW, what a terrific vehicle. I read a review before buying it that claimed it was the only SUV that truly drove like a car unlike others who claim the same, and I agree. It is very fun to drive, got hit with many snow storms this winter and I just drove right through everything with no problem, passing other struggling cars. Handles great, comfortable ride, technology is convenient. I have the Prestige package, fully loaded, and I don\\'t regret spending the extra money. Its a beautiful car and I feel good about myself when being seen with it (as shallow as that sounds) I have the Luxury package with the Milano Leather and ventilated seats, which I cant wait to try in the summer! BEST CAR Very Strange Experience So Far The car runs well, but when we brought the car in for the first service we were told the water pump had a leak and they had to replace it, but it needed to be ordered.  When they received the part we brought the car back to the dealer and they replaced the water pump but then told us there was a small leak in the transmission and they said Audi told them to replace the transmission.  Went back when they received the transmission and they replaced it but then they said it was programmed for a diesel and had to order another one.  Next one came and same problem.  Now we are waiting for the 3rd transmission to arrive and the car has been there for 2 weeks.  Still waiting for my car. Buyer Beware Audi Q5 is a great vehicle as long as you do not drive under 10 mph, I have a major transmission issue, 3rd replacement in 2 months, Audi corporate will not stand behind their products and work with you to satisfy yourself as a consumer, my vehicle has lurched and hesitated when coming to a stop causing 2 near accidents, I have never experienced such poor customer service form a corporate and a dealer standpoint, they act like it is my fault there is an issue, you have been warned! Just Plain Fun to Drive I purchased the prestige S-line model, and love it.  I was looking at the RX350, RDX, XC60,etc.. and this beats them out of the race.  The car is awesome looking from the outside and has all the gadgets to keep you happy. It is more masculine so guys can drive this feeling good and I get alot of looks But best of all it does not feel like you are driving an SUV but more like a car.  Space is just right, but if needing to hall more stuff in the hatch, then this may not be for you, but if your getting around town, taking kids and going to work this is perfect. Premium plus, really nice Nice car.  Interior design and quality are substantial.  Handles exceptionally well.  Power is faultless.  Gives a feeling of total control over driving experience.  Stock stereo with satellite radio is outstanding.  Love that everything is lit at night, no fumbling for any controls.  Easy integration with cell phone and i pod, voice commands work, nav. controls are confusing at first, but get better over time.  There is still lots to learn about how to get the most out of the electronics.  Roof rack is exceptionally easy to put on. A long list of suggested improvements, but still a killer car. Great pick if changing from coupe I changed from a Honda Accord coupe into the 2010 Q5 Premium Plus model with the S-Line package.  I love the smooth ride, the quiet of the engine and the ability to pick up speed quickly.  As for changing over from a coupe to a crossover, it has been seamless.  The car is nimble, parks in standard spaces yet feels a lot larger when on the road.  It also offers great general visibility from all sides.  I didn\\'t get the optional side assist feature, but still feel great about the views I do get. Awesome I purchased this vehicle a week ago.  The driving experience has far exceeded expectations.  The AWD keeps it glued to the road and the acceleration is very good.  Acceleration from 0 to 20 MPH is not fast, but after 40 MPH, acceleration is sports car like.  This is my first SUV and I was concerned about driving fun.  However, the high up seating position affords excellent visibility, the Q5 handles like a car and it is an overall fun ride.  I compared this to the RDX, XC60, RX350 and am very satisfied.  The Q5 is a luxury SUV/car, that is just the right size.  The Audi cockpit and attention to detail can\\'t be beat.  Also, the Q5 has plenty of room for the wife and kids. Excellent The interior is outstanding and the handling has been a pleasant surprise. It has the right amount of firmness and handles hills and acceleration beautifully. I am thoroughly impressed. The only negative comment I have is about the iDrive feature or whatever they call it. I was pretty proficient in the BMW iDrive and came to like it. I hope that I will eventually learn to navigate my Audi\\'s too, but so far it has not been intuitive. I think I will come to like it but it is going to take a few weeks to get used to it.  A Great Car! I picked up a Black Prestige a few days ago. I own a Volvo XC90, but handling in the Q5 is far superior, as it drives as a sports car. We had a massive snowstorn last week, which has made roads slippery and icy in Wisconsin. I am very impressed with how the Q5 handles the road under these conditions.  Regarding the purchase, I was between the Premium Plus with Nav and Prestige Packages. I went for the Prestige and paid the extra 3K, but I think the only accessory really worth the extra cost is the side-assist (only available for Prestige). I think the B&O Stereo is overrated. Overall, I am quite happy so far. This car has it all over the RX This car has it all over the RX. It has better electronic gadgetry, handling, design and is a blast to drive. The seamless bluetooth integration with my IPhone was totally painless and automatically took all my contacts without even prompting me. The voice recognition is excellent and I can call people without taking my eyes off the road as well as enter a destination. The quattro drive system is awesome and the LED daytime running  lights are very cool. The seats are very comfortable and lumbar support is fabulous. Great job Audi. Best by features, Worst by reliability 2010 Audi Q5 is good vehicle but reliability is sub par. I bought my Q5 in August 09. I had jerks with upshift and downshift due to improperly installed transmission filter which apparently was a factory defect. The convenience key also quit working and they had to change the whole convenience module. They fixed it all under warranty. When I called Audi they offered me a mere 5000 miles extension on warranty or $250 cash (for a $53000 car!!). Looks like they do not trust their own product. I am just frustrated that I have been sold a defective product. This Was A Good Decision Just picked up my Q5. This is the first luxury SUV that I\\'ve owned. The last time I experienced quality like this was when I owned a Jaguar. The ride is terrific. It\\'s solid, responsive and absolutely a ton of fun to drive. Audi has combined looks, performance and fun in their 2010 Q5! I\\'ve started reading the owner\\'s manual to get up to speed. There is a lot to this car and it will take awhile to understand all the bells and whistles but it\\'s worth it. I bought a Meteor Gray (great color) Premium Plus and added 19\" wheels and the B&O stereo. I\\'m looking forward to driving this vehicle for a long time. Test drive one of these and you\\'ll see that Audi has it all over Mercedes, BMW & Lexus.  I LOVE My Audi!!!! My husband and I sold our 15 year old BMW 530 and bought this wonderful vehicle.  I drive it most days and just love it. It\\'s not too high, so I don\\'t feel like I have to step up to get in to it.  It\\'s so fun to drive, I\\'m getting in to work early because I can\\'t wait to drive it.  I can\\'t find anything about it I would change.  The mileage is great!  Where has this vehicle been all these years!  I\\'m sold! I\\'m quite sure I\\'ll never drive anything else. Audi Q5   Performance-ride-quality Ordered our Q5 Prestige Pkg Audi on 27 Jul and on 3 Nov it arrived. The Q5 was worth the wait! Get the S-line pkg. The 20 inch chrome wheels put the finishing touch on this black beauty.  This is a great looking SUV with the best handling, ride, and appearance of all the mid-size SUVs (BMW/Lexus etc). Try the Q5 if you\\'re tired of seeing yourself at every traffic-light and/or parking space. My wife loves the way it handles and rides and the engine has enough power to satisfy her driving habits. I\\'ve owned other Audi\\'s making us qualified for a $1K loyalty discount. It has a first class dynamic 505 watt sound system. The Q5\\'s Quattro suspension system is like nothing you have ever driven. Unique Design Separates Q5 from the Rest This is my very first car.  My previous car was a 1997 Honda SUV that was handed down to me by my parents in 1997 when I was a teenager.    Interior: A+  Amazing.  Largest panoramic roof in its class.  Great finish compared to other luxury SUVs.   Audio: A+  The MMI interface allows you to control your Ipod on the MMI 6.5\\'\\' (I think) screen.  Very useful.   There are also 2 more speakers, 2 more than other luxury SUVs.  Performance:  Drives like a sports-sedan.  A+  Uniqueness:  Hardest car to get in North America (Forbers article).  Day-time running LED lights.  Design and style is different than other \"BOX\" SUVs.  Beats comparable SUVs like Lexus, X5, X3, Acuras, etc. Exactly what I was looking for I was coming down from a larger SUV and forgot how much fun a car could be to drive and I picked the perfect vehicle to remind me of that.  Performance transmission gear sends you off like a rocket, tight handling like a sports model and a great exterior make this price the deal of the year.  My family of 5 fits comfortably.  Not a lot of cargo room, hopefully future designs will take that into consideration.  Only complaint is difficult-to-use navigation system and it doesn\\'t always take most efficient route (but still worth getting). Little big Audi Great car to drive for short and long distances. I drive it during great traffic hours via NYC and it is fantastic! Car handling, design, interactive navigation, great stereo as well as huge sun roof are fantastic. I had BMW sport wagon and there is no comparison, as Audi is much better. Awesome Xover What an awesome vehicle. Only owned one foreign car, an Accord. Was shopping for several xovers and fell in love with this vehicle immediately. DO NOT test drive this beast, otherwise you will love it. Handles like a sedan and I haven\\'t yet broken in, so I\\'ve only touched the surface of this Q5\\'s potential. Heard people say Audi\\'s were nice but never really liked any of their sedans, except for the TT. If this Q5 is decently reliable, I\\'ll be an Audi purchaser again. Love my Q5!! X3 not even close Owned a BMW 325XI for 4 years and needed an SUV. Drove everything in the class, X3, VW Toureg, Nissan Murano, Toyota Highlander Mercedes etc and nothing at all comes even close to the level of refinement, exterior looks, interior (Audi sets the bench mark here). 270 Bhp, stunning LED daytime running lights, adequate usable space with the seats folded down. My wife absolutely loves it and made quick work of her first Costco run in the Q5 easily loading everything into the back with a smile on her face. (happy wife, happy life). Too bad the 3.0 TDI that is in the Q7 is not available in the Q5 at this time.  Sweet Ride Wow!  My Audi Q5 was delivered on Monday & what a sweet surprise!  I had bought it sight unseen and w/out a test drive... I am impressed!  The ride is smooth, it handles like a dream!  The interior is classy comfortable & has enough bells & whistles to thrill any technophile!  The Navigation is easy to use, bluetooth simple and the look is perfect!  The panoramic sunroof is impressive providing the feel of a convertible!  The exterior is beautiful with nice design and a sleek sexy look!  This is a driver\\'s dream in a mid-size SUV... Look out Lexus and BMW, there\\'s a new kid in town!!! Beautiful Just had my Q5 for one week.  Perfect blend of performance, luxury and practicality.  Love the engine sound and the way it handles, except when I\\'m listening to the incredible B&O stereo.  Can\\'t wait to get through the break-in period.  Still figuring out all the electronic controls.  Love the bluetooth phone and ipod controls.  Can\\'t wait to get through break-in period and let her rip. Big Bang for the Buck While not inexpensive or as technologically advanced as some other offerings in this car-size segment, the 2016 Q5 is well worth the investment. The seating and access are very comfortable; the ride is sure-footed and quiet and provides feedback from the road. The experience encapsulates what German mean when they speak of \"Fahrtvergnügen\" (joy of driving = control + security + responsiveness). The cumbersome navigation system in this model and the lack of a full range of passive safety features detract from the overall score. I would have given it five stars otherwise. I bought the SUV as a certified pre-owned vehicle with 11k miles on it and a six-year warranty. Not bad. The gas mileage has been better than anticipated (22 around town, up to 29 on the highway doing about 75mph. Best car I have ever owned. Love even with flaws The Q5 got me at hello.  Great design inside and out, comfortable, quick, economical, reliable, stylish.  A small thing but please put a plate on the rear bumper underneath the hatch so it\\'s not so easy to scratch.  Please catch up quick to technology; Japanese and American tech is better especially regarding the voice control.  Audi\\'s is too frustrating to bother with.  I had better in a rented KIA 7 years ago.  Also, adaptive cruise control and surround cameras should be standard in this day and age.  One of the major reasons I leased was I knew there\\'d be better tech on future models.  I guess you could say I\\'m exclusively dating the Q5 but ain\\'t going to get married ! Love my Audi! I love my Audi but the technology is very outdated for a 2016 vehicle. There are no USB ports and unless you have an apple phone the interface is not compatible.  Very frustrating!  Also the Nav system is not that great to work with when using  voice recognition. Lower back problems driver seat Started having lower back problems one month after purchasing the car. Did not realize it was the car with my back until my husband drove it and he had the same problems. Had to trade after 14 months of owning the car due to the problems. Only after driving my new car for one day, already feeling relief. I left my Lexus for an Audi Q5 After 15 years with my beloved Lexus RX300, which I passed to my daughter, it was time for a new ride.  I obviously adored my Lexus, but the new RX is huge, and the NX was a good size but had nasty yellowish pleather interior, boring handling and that awful spindle grill.   Instead I chose the Audi Q5 in Cuvee silver with Chestnut interior.  Gorgeous! It\\'s appearance makes my heart go pitter-pat, and it is SO much fun to drive.  My only complaint is the infotainment stuff.  Too granny sounding on the voice, and not intuitive enough overall.  But, I can forgive that part because I am in love with the classy looks, and the ride that is the perfect combination of buttery smooth and sporty/peppy.  So far, I\\'m proud to be an Audi Q5 owner.  I considered an X3 too, but the Audi is just so much better looking.UPDATE, 12/27/2017, 1.5 years of ownership:I still love the looks and ride of my Q5.  There are things I don\\'t love, though.  The mirrors are too big and block my view a lot, and the sun visors don\\'t extend and aren\\'t long enough for me (I\\'m 5\\'3\").  Voice control \\'granny\\' is pretty slow.  The bluetooth connection with my iphone is quite variable, and the voice with google maps only works about 50% of the time (the built in navigation I don\\'t even use, I\\'d much rather use my phone apps).  The a/c is not as good as the one on my 15 year old Lexus).  My windshield wiper sometimes takes a random trip across the window.  The doors are very heavy and tend to close when I don\\'t want them to if I\\'m entering or exiting the car in a parking spot that isn\\'t level.   Stuff in the back cargo area consistently shifts around a lot more than it ever did in my RX, though I\\'m not sure why, and I really don\\'t like that I can\\'t close the back cargo door with an interior button.  These are all relatively minor drawbacks, though there are many.  However, I really do love the way the car rides and handles, and it\\'s still one of the classiest looking SUVs on the road.6/2018 UPDATE: Still love my Audi except for the MMI (controls all infomation electronics), which is has gone dead twice in 1.5 years. Andy d Compare price offered to kkb.com In pieces on the shop floor at 400 miles Beautiful paperweight for the first four weeks I owned it. Timing shaft tensioner failed, then second time in it was the camshaft that failed. Audi refused buyback saying basically \"too bad.\" heavy passenger door Audi Q5 is a wonderful SUV overall, except the doors are causing problem for us. The doors are very heavy, and tend to swing close by themselves. My wife hurt her finger when putting staff in the car and the door was unexpected closing so fast by itself!  Watch for the doors, they are dangerous! Great car as long as there is not a problem. This is our third Q5 in a row.  When the car was 2 days old the backup warning system failed and I backed into a mailbox   The dealer told me the system sensors needed a deep cleaning, which they did, but would not repair a small dent.  I complained to Audi, they said it is up to the dealer because that would be covered under the warranty.  The dealer said Audi refuses to pay for the damage.  During the next six months the GPS would freeze and the MMS system would simply not turn on at times.  I complained to the dealer again this times they told me there was an update to the software due to problems that Audi was having.  The dealer and Audi Still refused to take responsibility for a failed system.  This will be my last Audi not because the Q5 isn\\'t a good car but because Audi does not back their vehicles like other companies I have dealt with in the past.It’s been over two years now and the car has been flawless. Liked my 2014 Q5 so much - I leased another! I had a 2014 Q5 Premium Plus 2.0 lease that was up for renewal recently.   In over 30 years of leasing vehicles I\\'ve NEVER leased the same vehicle twice as every one of them seemed to have some quirk or flaw that made me want to try something different.   However, in this case I ended up leasing the a newer version of the exact same Q5.  Why? because I test drove everything else out there and could not bear to part with the Q5.   Superb all around car and hands down the best engines on the road today.   After 36K miles on the 2014, zero flaws and the exterior and interior still look it came off the showroom.   My new 2016 is even better, if that\\'s possible. There is a reason this SUV consistently gets 5 star ratings. Sweet ride! I love the body style. Interior is somewhat lacking compared to the Mercedes GLC but still nice. Ride and handling is what you would expect from German engineering, flawless. I would definitely recommend this SUV. I loved my 2012 Q5 so much I bought a 2016! I purchased a new 2012 Q5 2.0T and drove it for over 120,000 miles without any problems.  It drove like a sports sedan and I regularly got over 30 mpg.  I am now own a 2016 Q5 2.0T and am amazed that with all the updates, the new one is even better.  Fantastic car! Fun Car This car is very comfortable and a pleasure to drive. Plenty of front seat legroom. This car has the Technology Package as well. Information/Entertainment center takes some study to learn. Can be difficult when driving.  This is a fun SUV to drive after driving a MB CLK350 for the past 5 years. Awesome Audi The navigation system is not user friendly Bye Bye BMW I have driven BMWs since 1999.  I owned a 2000 540i, a 2004 X-5 4.4, a 2008 750iL, and a 2011 535i with the sport package.  At some point, between the 2008 and 2011 models, BMW turned into Lexus.  The 2011 535i was a thoroughly competent vehicle.  It had an excellent engine.  Everything else was just vanilla.  It simply was not the type of car you looked forward to driving.  I bought a 2016 Q5 3.0T.  Its great to drive a true German car again.  The steering in this car allows you to feel the road.  The suspension is firm and engaged but doesn\\'t come close to feeling harsh.  There are plenty of luxury features.  in short, if you enjoy driving a car but like the convenience of an SUV, this is simply a great car. My third q5 Traded in a 2.0 liter q5. For loaded 3.0. Just love this vehicle. It is heavier then the 2.0 and better in ice and snow. The 3.0 liter is very quick and really goes when you need it. It is quiet with windows up and the sun roof is huge with no vibration with Windows up. A first for me. Voice command could be better and that\\'s my only complaint. Quiet ride which is stiff and secure which I prefer. Decided to buy before model change because I knew what I was getting and really like this model. Audi Q-5 SUV The Q5 is a solid performer in the SUV luxury class.  I am a full size guy- 6 feet and 222 lbs and it is very comfortable to drive. Handles well. Excellent sound system.  Nav ststem needs to be updated and was in the 2017 model Q7.  The version I have is very quirky to use and the female voice sounds like an 80 year old woman ( no disrespect intended). Excellent trunk space and seats go down easily. Other than Nav system the technology is very good. Idaho Audi This crossover is terrific. Design, ride, engine(3.0), cabin, acceleration...you name it and wow. Meets and exceeds our expectations. Technology is good but not up to some of its competitors in all aspects. Back up camera view is blue and orange....Not the best for visibility for the driver. No  collision avoidance...should be standard. Coming in 2017? Blind spot alert is very visible, a plus. Instruments well laid out. Controls intuitive...no more smudges on the screen. Sound system(B&O) aka as concert hall, very rich. Seat pre sets: steering wheel not included, a big oversight by Audi. Wipers and lights wonderful. Cabin noise could be less. Wife is 5\\'2\" so access is easy compared to other suv\\'s. New 2016 Q5 speed and comfort.. Updating my review..    overall its a great car but one annoyance is driving me crazy..   excessive brake dust..   my rims are constantly black.   Audi swears its because the brakes are so good and strong but I feel like I have a lemon when it comes to the brakes.   Nice shiny chrome rims look like they are matte black.   its a very odd issue.. Great Ride comes  w Great Luxury and Performance! I have had the pleasure of driving a well built, great performing luxury SUV, the 3.0T equipped, 2016 Audi Q5. I have chosen the S-Line model, which has some of the nicest body lines that compliment the Black Optics over Ibis white color scheme. Equipped with the Tech package and 21\" wheels, the Q5 is pure enjoyment! The black leather interior is practical, functional and very comfortable. I do have the Sport Interior, which gives you the flat bottom steering wheel and firmer sport seats with thigh supports. The Bang and Olefsen stereo is a superb sounding, enriching pleasure every time I play it a little on the loud side. With a well laid out display, the MMI response could be more responsive, but it is not burdensome. Satisfaction and contentment are equally matched with adrenaline and excitement whenever you need the supercharged V6 engine to come to life. Excellent throttle response leads to spirited acceleration, seat planting torque and miles of smiles as you allow this performance SUV to stretch it\\'s legs. Audi has put forth a nicely balanced, visually and sensory pleasing vehicle at a very affordable price. I highly recommend this drivetrain package over the 2.0T level, as you get a firmer suspension, larger brakes, dual outlet exhaust and a horsepower/torque range that will put enjoyment at your finger tips! Great car  My Q and I Love it.... Can Rule the Road Pros:Awesome interiorGood speakersDriver viewCons:No USB ports Outdated technologySummary: I have had it only for a month and below are a few observations. The drive is really good and driver vantage points are numerous. Quite a good amount of legroom for the driver. The road looks well lit with the awesome lights. The parking assist is really helpful.A few minor hiccups are, there are no USB ports. Has one connector in the glove box to hook up an iPod classic or older generations. Can add the new iOS connector as an attachment but cannot have the phone connected to it and Bluetooth on at the same time.Got only the Audi care package included and declined the packages for paint n dent protection. Got a ski rack included with the vehicle, it\\'s lying indoors and will stay dead till the year I ski. A prospective buyer should probably negotiate for a cargo carrier if not interested in the ski rack.The drive and music are good, will know about the maintanence costs only after a few years. 2016 Q5 Premium Plus from Naples My 2016 Q5 is an excellent overall car, looks great, interior finish is very good, and 2.0 Turbo runs very well with good acceleration.  Gas mileage is ok for 4 cylinder turbo and large gas tank gives you great driving range.  Gas mileage should be much higher on highway.  I get 26/27 at best on highway. Radio sound is excellent and easy media interface but no USB port.  The Navigation system works well and it\\'s great to be able to send your directions to the car from Google or my cell. Overall the Nav is easy and accurate to set.  Voice controls works as well as any of them but could use work.  The push button start works well and the best feature is the side mirror closure when the locks and alarm are set.  Works great and all automatic on closure and on open.  The Audi grille and overall look is special and there\\'s plenty of room in the rear compartment.  I also like that you can roll the rear seats forward for more cargo room, very nice.   Just a great car to drive and a great look and overall good functionality for a mid size SUV.  Get great feedback from all on the looks of the Q5. Great Car but poor city mileage I love driving this car, so nice but I wish few things were taken care of:1) USB Port not there2) Poor mileage in city driving conditions3) Not compatible with Apple Carplay absolutely loving it !  Very Nice Car The Q5 is well made, fast, comfortable and quiet.  The most impressive thing for me was the power of the 4 cylinder turbo.  I was really aiming for the 6 cylinder. But, it was unnecessary as the 4 is fast, powerful and it shifts beautifully.  The moon roof and features are impressive.  Gas mileage has been very good.  Overall, very happy with this decision. Love it and cannot leave it! We flip a coin to see who gets to drive our 2016 Audi Q5 on road trips. Can\\'t say enoughabout all the positive aspects of this vehicle. Handling, comfort, interior, are all impressive.The sunroof is a great plus to this SUV as well, which filters to just let enough light in no matter what season. 2016 Audi Q5 superb! love this car! A 1 Thats our Q5 Every category is 5 star except a USB port. We have owned the Q5 for 9 months, great vehicle!Couldn\\'t be happier. As I noted prior a 2016 Q5 sh have had a USB. However, purchasing an adapter is not a \"big deal\".... New owner Expect typical depreciation for german car, I have only 200 miles on my new one but anticipate keeping it 15+/- years which if you do the math pencils out; so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it but can only provide limited review due to my limited time in the vehicle although in the short time I have driven it I love the performance, road manners and it may be getting great mileage as the needle has barely moved since I picked up the vehicle. King of the Road Vault like build quality, feels like driving an elegant and maneuverable mini-tank on the road! Love my Audi!  Audi Q5 SLine premium Car is everything we hoped for.  Price was exceptional thru Edmunds. Car is comfortable and smooth to drive.  Should give us years of great service. Not so Great SUV! We bought the 2016 3.0 TDI prestige package with all options and initial we are very happy with the choice we made.  Fuel economy is still very good and the handling is excellent.  The only minor inconveniences are that it lacks USB ports and the color navigation screen is not touch screen which makes it somewhat cumbersome.   This model year does not come with apple iPhone interface.   This technology is available in much less expensive American and Chinese made SUV\\'s.   The steering wheel media/phone controls are very limited in their functions.  In order to lower the volume or change audio tracks you need to reach down to the knob that is located on the  center counsel making you have to momentarily remove your eyes from the road.  The location of the cruise control is also very bad.  Again you need to remove your eyes from the road in order to not confuse it with the turn signal switch which is located above the CC switch.   The VW Golf that I own has much better steering wheel media and CC equipment integration management.  Other then that it has a very confrontable ride for an SUV.  All in all compared to other USA brand SUVs in the same luxury category, the 2016 Audi Q5 falls short on the attention to details in the ergonomic/technology department.  In my opinion \"Made in Germany\" is not that good anymore.  Its paid for so I have to keep it for a while. Early impression of a 2016 Q5 TDI I\\'ve become a big fan of diesels for their driving characteristics and efficiency.  The Q5 TDI does not disappoint.  This SUV is very quick with little turbo lag, which gives a lot of confidence pulling out into traffic and merging, whether from a stop or at highway speeds.  The engine is very refined.  For a family of 4 I felt the Q5 was the right size.  I also liked the 3L TDI over the 2L offerings in BMW and MB.  There is not much of a hit in mugs going with the 3L, since I have been getting around 30 mpg around town and mid 30s on the highway.  The seats are comfortable, although they could be softer.  The lumbar support is good.  The sound quality of the Bang and Olufsen sound system is very good.  The MMI infotainment system takes time to get the hang of, but is logical once you learn your way around.  Most selections are made using the center console, since there are not many buttons on the steering wheel.  I\\'m enjoying the panoramic roof more than I expected since it fills the interior with light and makes the car feel even roomier.  I have the 20 inch wheels and I\\'m pleased that this does not make the ride harsh.  This SUV has a firm ride and handles more like a sedan.  Even on a 6 hour drive I did not feel fatigued and felt confident driving in a torrential rainstorm.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles the snow, once I put the 17 inch blizzaks on.  So far, very satisfied with my purchase. Take care of your Q5 and it will take care of you First off, I purchased my Q5 with 50,000 miles 3 years ago and it now has 110,000 miles. I have done NOTHING to the vehicle except replace the break pads (front and rear) and put new tires on. My vehicles still rides like a dream and we absolutely love it. It floats on the roads and over bumps, and we are set on getting a newer model 2013 and up next. I have not taken my car at all to the Audi dealership because and I avoid them like the plague. I did my brakes at a local Belle Tire for half the price the Audi dealer wanted and I even change my oil at Belle tire and I run Amsoil Oil ONLY in my car. I have noticed my Q5 runs quieter with this oil than the actually oil the Audi dealer uses. Oh and i have the 3.2. which is much more solid than the 2.0. I hope this helps Buyer Beware Audi\\'s have a airbag recall.  We found out when we were trading ours in to purchase a new Lincoln MKX.  I called Audi and checked online and at this moment there is no fix!!!  And they have until December 2019 to find a fix.  So, we have decided to lose thousands and trade it in anyway.  I feel like we were robbed by Tanaka and robbed by Audi.  Buy American!! Great car! Just take care of it! We purchased this car with 24,000 miles on it, and we have all the service records. The owners before us were very meticulous, and they had very few issues, and we have now put 6,000 miles on it and still have had no problems. The review that complains about having to replace the brakes at 30k is driving in the city constantly, I can tell because they also had to have the carbon build-up cleaned. Carbon build-up is a fact of life for direct injected engines, but when the car is driven at highway speed, the combustion chamber gets hot enough to burn off the carbon. Also, take care of your car. Change the oil with VW 502 00 approved oil every 5,000 miles, and keep up on scheduled maintenance.  German engineered nonsense Instead of going into a long winded review of my 2009 Audi Q5, i will simply list the warranty work that has been performed thus far:- replaced center console- replaced water pump- replaced exterior HID light system- repaired gas lid- replaced rear hatch struts- removed engine for DE-carbon (3 full days)- replaced fuel injection- replaced steering rod & pumpNon warranty:- replaced brakes and rotors (30K) Avoid this over engineered junk Beautiful vehicle and lots of fun to drive. Great interior. Excellent manners even on Illinois pot holded roads. Now the bad news. Quality issues from day one. Spent more time in the service shop than in my garage. Had issues with audio system, numerous unexplainable warning lights that pop up and go away on their own. Head gasket leaks after 6 months. I don\\'t believe I bought a lemon. Seems many owners seem to have quality issues. Don\\'t fall for the looks. I\\'m through buying over engineered junk from Germany.  Complete Package I don\\'t know what is happening with the people who are claiming to have such catastrophic problems with their Q5\\'s.  I myself and two other acquaintances all bought Q5\\'s last spring or summer.  Between the 3 cars, none of us have experienced a single problem with any of them, and I have put 16,000 miles on in the first year alone.  I had leased several Lexus\\x92s prior, and was reluctant to change brands specifically because I was worried about reliability: I did, and have never been happier.  This car is gorgeous, comfortable and has more features than I could get in the Lexus for a comparable price- and as of now, the Audi is more reliable!  Many problems This car was my first luxury car and what a disappointment.  Engine light comes on and stays on but dealer can\\'t find a problem.  Air conditioner works sometimes.  Has a problem restarting when gassing up.  Service not what is promised in the sales pitch.  Would sell tomorrow if I could get my money back. My husband has driven several luxury cars without these kind of headaches. The Best Would like to see some reviews on 2010 model. Considered the BMW X3 & X5, VW Tiguan & Tourag and MB GLK. Decided the Q5 was the best bet. Have owned it for 30 days and haven\\'t regretted my choice yet. Overall quality, fit & finish, drivability are outstanding. Negative comments in 2009 reviews seem to be fixed for 2010 (steering and tranny). Gadgets are mind boggling until you learn how to use the and then you learn to love them. Side mirror/ hatch back dr/ Cruise contr I enjoy my car and it is awesome looking but the side mirrors are too big to be point that I even had an accident because of them.1st time in 37 years and the hatch back door needs to be automatic in all models. Cruise control is terrible as it is an instant when you try to change the set speed. Other than that, all else is great. Dragonfly Buyer beware of water pump issues I have been very happy with my Audi Q5 until today.  Had car towed into dealership after the coolant burst in the engine compartment.  I pretty much lost all coolant - luckily i was about to park it in the garage.  Found out today that the water pump failed at 7,800 miles.  It is covered under warranty but warranty or not this is a major issue.  I have so far seen a mass of posts with the same issue.  Fortunately for me the engine never had the opportunity to overheat.  Audi needs to address the issue with their current owners immediately. Q5 is best choice I could have made Was driving an S-line A6 for past 2 years and while it was great it was too big for me.  The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV. I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like \\'soccer mom\\' cars until the Q5. That\\'s what made the difference. The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs \\'cute\\'. One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip.  My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool.  Transmission default Although a very good looking car and fun to drive at high speeds, this car transmission technology is still too new and Audi has not full control over it, I have a default transmission, and am not the only one, they have no right answers as how to fix it, they first exchange the mechatronics which has nothing to do with the jerking of the transmission in the lower gears, and after trying different things and not being able to repair the car their best solution is to replace the entire transmission in a vehicle that has less than 2800 miles. That to me as a customer is unacceptable. Audi Q5 - Great SUV! My wife in on her second Audi (first an A4, now an A6). I\\'m the \"designated SUV driver\" in the family. I had a 5 year old Nissan Murano, which performed well and was a good value, but I\\'ve always been jealous of my wife\\'s Audi(s). I looked at several mid-sized SUV\\'s as a replacement, but none compared with the Q5. It drives like a sport sedan, with all of the comfort and convenience of a SUV. The size is perfect for getting around downtown and parking spaces, but it feels very large inside.     Awesome, almost perfect, Audi This car looks and handles great. It is fun to drive, has plenty of cargo space, and has a great sound system.  I came from a Mercedes with every bell and whistle imaginable and with this car, don\\'t miss it.  I agree that the side mirrors are too big and take getting used to. I do also agree the the shifting of the gears when breaking can be a little jerky- I may just need to get used to it.  Best In Its Class I traded in my 2004 VW Touareg V8 with 125,000 miles.  I love this new car.  It drives like a dream, a sports car feel with the high ride of an SUV.  The interior is simply elegant (I got the Cinnamon brown leather and deep blue exterior), premium plus with Navigation and 19inch wheels.  My closest choice was the Volvo XC60, which is also a great car, but the MMI system on the Audi is just, well, cool.  The volvo\\'s nav feels very old school and clunky. My only criticism of this car is that when the back seats fold down, there is a gap across the cargo area that a dog\\'s feet could get caught in.  Also, the MMI phone system is a dial rather than buttons and plugging in for voicemail is a pain. Great Ride & Performance- GPS lacking My 2009 Prestige Q5 rides like a sport sedan. Great acceleration (especially in sport mode), and responsive steering. I was really surprised on my first all highway trip (approx 75 miles), when I averaged 29.1 mpg! The ride is a bit bumpy on side street streets. Great access to rear storage due to low entry. Seats fold easily. Bang and Olefsun sound system is awesome. The GPS leaves a lot to be desired. The \"point of interest\\'s\" do not let you choose ANY retail stores. Good luck trying to find nearest Home Depot, Staples, Target, or supermarket- NOT HAPPENING. The restaurant search is a basic listing- can\\'t choose cuisine- Italian, Japanese, etc. My $200 Garmin GPS is far superior. Audi owner This is my sixth Audi and the second SUV. Although I love the Q7, I didn\\'t need one that big. I traded it in for the new Q5 and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Audis are very strong and safe cars to drive; they handle the roads so well; especially in these New England winters. There is a sense of security when driving them that I have not felt with other brands. So thrilled Previous car was a Subaru 08 STI 5 dr hatch. Speed, agility, utilitarian use best describes our needs. STI proved to be too low for driving on VT pot hole roads. So what was out there that would be fun to drive, quick acceleration, a great solid ride, not too fancy in appearance and interior, yet functional? My friends on facebook submitted their suggestions, this is how I came across the q5! In traffic, great visibility, amazing control maneuvering slow pokes. Quiet. An overall sense of being in your own world with its secure solid build. Great turning into parking spaces. The vehicle drives and feels small. We bought the premium model, base with some options which kept the price down.  Great Crossover SUV I bought the Q5 after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the last 5 years. I loved my jeep and hated to give it up but the build quality was poor and gas mileage was terrible.  I wanted a higher quality vehicle that still could function as a SUV but drove well and offered better gas mileage. The Q5 fits the bill. The Q5 has a high ground clearance and decent cargo room. It handles great and I\\x92ve been getting 25 MPG + at 75 MPH.  The cabin is quiet, the seats are comfortable and the visibility is very good. This car provides great car performance with the functionality (functions you use 99% of the time) of a SUV. This is one of the best reviewed luxury SUV\\x92s on the market and I can see why! Absolutely the \"best crossover\" now!! Test drove many SUV / crossovers in this segment including X3 and RX350.  Hands down Audi Q5 won.  I have owned it now for three (3) weeks -and- the car is simply perfection in all aspects from comfort to performance.  MMI Navigation/Audio annoyance Do not buy the MMI Navigation/Audio system unless you enjoy having it on every time you start the vehicle. You have two choices when starting your car. 1) The display comes on and the radio/media begins playing. OR 2) The display comes on with an Audi advertisement screen and the radio/media is off. Trying to blank the Audi advertisement screen causes the radio/media to come back on. You cannot start the car with the display and audio off. This is extremely annoying! I contacted Audi customer care. The representative verified this operation. I was told this operation is normal and they have no plans to fix it. There is no software/firmware update available to address this problem. Excellent Luxury Crossover Amazing ride, quality and craftsmanship.  Drove the X3 and XC60 and the q5 beats them hands down in all areas.  Audi has really done a good job in engineering this car.  My only complaint is that Audi should include more standard options on a premium plus.  Bang and Olufsen, in my opinion should be standard on a premium plus.  Heated seats are standard but currently there isn\\'t an option for Cool/ventilated seats.  They get really hot in the summer.  For a 40+ thousand dollar car, one would expect more standard options.  If there was a option to score on Value, i would give it a 7 or 8 simply because you can find more options for the price in Cadillacs, Lexus, Acura.   New Q5 Took delivery of new Q-5 with Premium/Prestige Packages and immediately set out on 1,200 mile trip.  Vehicle performed almost flawlessly.  The GPS stopped functioning necessitating the rebooting of the MMI.  Q-5 held the road well at speeds to 80mph. Gas mileage averaged a whopping 25mpg.  Interior is well appointed. Everything about the Q-5 is solid.  The B&O stereo is without equal. This is a great vehicle. Sporty SUV, Lacking Interior Comfort I really love this car. I like the handling and the acceleration. There are a ton of features for the price. The only complaints I have are the gas mileage is kind of poor, and the leather seats are kind of hard and don\\'t really hold you in them very well. The Navigation screen would also be better in a touch screen. Love this Car This is my first Audi and my first cross-over vehicle and I am thoroughly impressed with this car.  Looked at a lot of different cars and nothing seemed to have everything I wanted until I drove the Audi.  Very good power for a V6, handles well and has a very smooth ride.  Great interior, good cargo space and the sunroof is fantastic.  I\\'ve owned 2 Acuras, a 325 and 525 BMW and a Mercedes (which I\\'ll never buy again), and this car meets and/or exceeds those.  Better value for the $$ than the comparable X3 or X5 or Lexus or Mercedes.  Better features than the Acura RDX.  Really happy with the purchase and I highly recommend the Q5 for anyone looking in this class of cars. Q5 3.2 v6 I just bought 2 days ago. Engine is smooth on acceleration. A family of 4 can comfortably seat. I am having a blast. I love it. Bull in Sheep\\'s Clothing With Audi drive select you can change its driving properties quite nicely.  With the ADS and the S Line tires and wheels (Michelin Latitude Sport). It will stick with the best of them. Comfort setting for potholes works well. Prestige package is worth it. Pricey, but a very nice ride! I NEVER write reviews Okay, this is my first review on a car. I have previously owned 3 Lexus, BMW, Acura, and Toyota\\'s.  This is my first Audi, had test drove the A4 when buying Acura and was not impressed, so almost did not even look at the Q5. Glad I did, this IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. Upside, engine is great, street from my house is a hill and a turn against oncoming traffic, the car provides the extra torque in the rear wheel for complete control, ALL other cars has issue with this even BMW 535i also 2009.  Interior is extremely nice - I have nearly all the options so car price tag is $50k, which is appears overpriced at first, but when comparing quality interior and options is right on the money. Handles poorly in Town/City traffic Car has a serious issue with the gearbox. In start/stop traffic, the gear is either too low or too high. Unable to shift correctly. Jerky harsh ride in town driving. Fuel economy is much poorer than the stated. Impresive Audi The lease for my MB ML320 ended so I did some shopping around. I\\'ve tried Acura RDX and MDX and I had serious concern on passenger safety and lack of visibility. The same experience I had with Infiniti. MB GLK is really repulsive in design and BMW is still in the works to replace the outdated X3. Q5 was the best choice that I could have made. The design is outstanding, craftsmanship on the same level. Nice gadgets and the rooftop made my life so easy in convincing my wife: a 10 out of 10. I love this car! This car is such a big upgrade from our 2006 X3 (which we loved), I can only begin to describe it.  Comfortable, huge acceleration, great steering, excellent visibility.  Perfect car for our little family driving around the city.  Plenty of room for car seats, strollers, groceries, etc. and looks good enough to bring out for a night on the town.  Little nits: side mirrors are too big, auto-dimming rear view mirror dims too often, and brakes are a tad squishy for my taste.   But, I love driving this car.  Best car we\\'ve owned.  By far.  Including my BMW 328 (blasphemy!).   Compared the Volvo XC60, Mazda CX-9, BMW X5, Acura MDX, Lexus RX350:  this was a no brainer.   Nice ride Excellent all-around luxury SUV.  Traded in our 2004 Volvo XC 90 (transmission problems). Looked at the Volvo XC60 and Lexus RX 350 among several others. After the dealer let us take the demo for a weekend we were sold.  The ride is far more superior and has many luxury features in a very attractive package, inside and out.  This car is just plain fun to drive and exudes quality. We are getting about 21 mpg overall (majority city driving). Awesome! Owned 2 Mercedes and it was time for a change. We looked at everything in this segment. The choice was easy, the Q5 won the battle hands down. Only had the car a couple days and love it. Got the premium plus package in meteor gray pearl. This car is completely amazing. This SUV drives like a car and sticks to the road better than the CLK we just turned in. If you are looking for a small SUV look no further, you won\\'t be disappointed. A clear break from the norm Premium Plus w/nav in Ibis White  I had never really considered an Audi until I drove the Q5. It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive. Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode (and Triptronic) is where the fun is...0-60 in FAST!  MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don\\'t have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one. Best car ever! I\\'ve had more fun driving this car than any car I have owned and I\\'ve had several sports cars.  Put the transmission in \"S\" and punch it and it throws you back in the seat.  We test drove the Volvo, Lexus, and MDX.  This car was far superior! It was the only one that said, \"Buy me\"!  Everything about it  screams quality and luxury.  We have been averaging about 19 mpg. I\\'m sure it would be higher if I could keep my foot out of it!  It\\'s just a super fun car to drive! We have the Prestige model--- definitely worth the upgrade! Wonderful!!! I LOVE my new Audi Q5. Traded in a LandRover which was a major expensive headache. I have made a great choice... what a head turner. I strongly recommend the Q5 it is wonderful all the way around! I am so pleased with my vehicle!!!! Great Compact SUV Just bought a Q5 Premium Plus with Navigation.  Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want.  But Audi is now offering 2.9%, 36 months financing and will make my 1st 2 payments, so net net it is like 0% financing + $500 discount.  The car is perfect for my wife.  The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK.  Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors.  My only complaint is the relatively small interior space, especially when compared to RX350.  Otherwise, it was perfect.   Your choice is clear. My brother needed a new vehicle for work. He asked me for help. We researched and test drove all the competition. The Q5 was the clear winner. My local dealership had a hail storm and he was able to get his Q5 repaired and looking new for $8000 off the selling price (not MSRP). At such a deal I bought one also. His is black with tan interior and mine is white with tan interior. We both got the premium plus, but he also got the MMI package. No need for bigger rims or S- line for us. In two weeks he put 1500 miles on his Q5 and could not be happier. Outstanding Car Compared this car with other models and brands. Clearly ahead of the competition. Styling, interior room, sporty handling and more than enough power. Fuel economy as advertised. Loaded with technology. Was about to purchase an X5. After driving the Q5 and comparing space, feel and price, the Q won hands down. Great car! 1 Fun SUV We bought this car in April of 09 for my wife and I am ready to take it from her! The car is super fun to drive and especially so in the Sport mode. Has more get up and go than I ever expected. The transmission in the regular Drive mode can be a bit sluggish, but works fine. There is plenty of room in the car, I am 6 foot tall and the person behind me still has an adequate amount of room. Only had the car for a month now, but I am already a big Audi fan. Thrilled with my Q5 I\\'ve had the car two months and couldn\\'t be more satisfied.  I was regretting handing in my BMX X3 (still love that car) but the Q5 is more luxurious, more comfortable, smoother, better gas mileage, and just as fun to drive.   I\\'m glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23.  The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver.  The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car.  Thru traffic, Manhattan streets, suburban highways and local driving, it gives a consistent and fun-tastic drive.  And my passengers have no complaints either.  Thanks Audi! Q5 is the only way to go! My brother needed a new ride and after test driving all competitors bought an Audi Q5 premium plus w/navigation. I followed suit and bought a Q5 premium plus and could not be happier. I am a research junkie and hands down the Q5 beat out the competition. I look forward to many happy years of driving my Q5. Poor Gas Mileage Beware of the ugly gas mileage.  I can only get the 18 mpg in the city on the vehicle instant mpg calculator if I am going down hill with my foot off of the accelerator.  It\\'s stupid. Impressions of my new Q5 I purchased my new Q5 from Audi of Oxnard.  I did extensive research prior to the purchase.  I wanted all wheel drive for skiing plus a place where both my surfboard and lab dog could fit.  I wanted comfort, bluetooth, nav, and pretty much all  goodies.  The full size moon/ sun roof is a cool addition. I replaced my 06 Acura MDX where the lease just ended. The Audi is extremely comfortable, with fit and finish second to none.  Smaller than the mdx, but still o.k. and with better mileage.  I got 23.5 on first tank, city and highway.  The center stack which controls the radio and nav takes some getting used to. Beats \\'em all Test drove BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura and Infiniti. Audi is absolutely the BEST by far. The quality, craftsmanship, fit and finish is beyond compare. Got the Meteor Gray pearl, light gray interior &  Premium plus pkg. Have caused countless head turns on the road and while parked. Those LED daytime running lights really get everyone\\'s attention. Precise handling; Superb ride. The perfect urban SUV We\\'ve driven the Q5 (with Premium Plus) for a month and we absolutely love it.  It\\'s small enough for urban driving/parking, but is roomier and built more intelligently than the X3 that it replaced.  Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car.  Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads.  MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving.  My only complaints are that the brakes are a bit squishy and the side view mirrors are huge. This is great for side visibility, but limits front visibility a bit when making turns, for example.  I think we\\'ll get used to it. \"The best\" I have had 2 Mercedes (Ml320 and E320) and my Q5 is much better in everything, I traded in a 08 MDX that I bought because Honda and Acura reputation, but  I had to take the MDX 3 times to dealership to fix A/c and I recently discovered a noise on the transmission, so I decided - That\\'s it!! and bought the Q5. I could not be happier with it. Absolutely Perfect! ...no comparison!  I just bought the q5 with the premium plus pkg, and it\\'s FANTASTIC! The gas mileage is better than advertised. The LED lights are awesome! It handles just like a vehicle, but with the stamina of an SUV. I am 5\"4 and this car doesn\\'t feel \\'too large\\'. The interior is classy, and goes above and beyond all of the competition. I have been looking for a year for an SUV (MB, BMW, Lexus), and nothing comes close to the genius Audi put together with the Q5. I leased this vehicle, but after driving it for 2 weeks, I am quite certain I\\'ll end up purchasing it @ lease end. If you haven\\'t driven the Q5, add it to the top of your list, this is one vehicle that is a must drive!  Perfectly sexy! Q5...truth in engineering equals driving fun. Sexy inside & out.Truly a head-turner! Behind the  wheel is perfectly engaging. Driving one is more than an ultimate experience. Q5 is the ultimate expression of PERFECTION! Owning one is a dream come true. Audi q5 premuim plus Been looking for about a year on a crossover that my wife & I would like. The Q5 has a very nice exterior look to it. The interior is comfortable for a person that 6\\'5\". The Q5 has more than enough get up & go to it. Gas mileages is not bad (19 mpg). Traded in a XC90 Volvo.    Would Never Buy American Again! After trading in my 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a 09 Q5 Prestige, I can honestly say i would never buy an American car again.  The Q5 is far better than the Jeep in every way, especially in the snow.  We test drove this car during a snow storm and wow, the quattro is amazing.  It would not let us fishtail or slide at all, and it just kept us going in a straight line.  Aside from that, the MMI is pretty easy to use, the Bang & Olufsen sounds great and the panoramic sunroof is amazing, the whole roof is pretty much glass.  Last but not least, the LED\\'s both front and rear look incredible.  They were one of the main reasons I bought this car. Bullseye!!! Traded in my Infiniti M35X.  Have always been a fan of Japanese car quality but decided to try a German car.  The school commercial captivated my attention as I was considering an Lexus RX350.  The commercial helped me to realize that I should try something not so main stream as there are a lot of Lexus RXs out there.  One test was all it took to blow me away.  The Q5 drives and feels like a sport sedan as handling and acceleration are excellent.  The build quality is phenomenal.  Seats are extremely comfortable.  The  gas mileage has been higher than advertised as I am getting just over 27 mpg on the highway (at 65-70 avg speed) vs sticker which claims 23.  You can\\'t get a much better car. Prestige - S-Line I just recently purchased the car.  As an understatement, it is absolutely perfect.  Excellent engine response and handling.  The navigation system and audio commands are superior. I drove several competitors, i.e., Lexus X350, MB M500, Infiniti X35, and the Q5 is by far the best of the lot.  If one is looking for a high performance Crossover vehicle, I HIGHLY recommend the Audi Q5. Great car with all the features you want Traded our Acura TSX for an Audi Q5 and could not be happier with the choice. The Audi Q5 does not handle like your normal SUV and it gives us better mileage so far in the City and on Highway driving with way more storage room than the Acura TSX and ability to haul more stuff. I would certainly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller SUV, a lot of fun, power and style. Can\\'t Get Much Better! This isn\\x92t going to be your typical car review. This one is taking on a new twist, it\\x92s from the front passengers viewpoint. MS took driving away from me 19 years ago, but I\\x92m still more than able to be the judge of a vehicles stature and quality. Back in 2001 I purchased an Audi Allroad. It was an exceptional car, and always a \\x93head-turner\\x94.  We recently traded it in on a 2009 Q5, and so far we have no regrets. The quality, detail and build is typical Audi\\x85\"First-Class\". Front seaters well over 6 ft in height have plenty of leg/headroom to spare. The 270hp V6 has enough punch to easily set you back in your seat. The shifting is very smooth and so is the ride. The Q5 also turns heads. Our Sunday Car My wife and I just purchased the Q5.  It was quite a trade up from a Toyota Corolla. The interior styling is far superior to its Mercedes and BMW competitors.  All three trims are great, and the Prestige is amazing.  All three trims have the same engine - which has all the power we\\'d ever need.  It has all the bells and whistles.   Traded S5 My wife and I traded our S5 in on the Q5 and honestly the quality and build is the same. We\\'ve owned the Acura RDX and Toyota\\'s Higlander in the past this vehicle is by far superior. We have owned BMW\\'s before and looked at the X3 we are glad we waited. This vehicle gives us some of the performance we enjoyed in the S5 without all of the attention we got in the S5,we get some but not as much.It also gives us the comfort of the S5 with greater cargo space. You forget you\\'re riding in a SUV. We\\'ve only had it a couple of weeks, we\\'ll stick with Audi.I miss the B&O :( . Rollin\\' Down the Highway and Queen of the Road So what would make me the Queen?  Great looks, performance and comfort.  Decent gas mileage is a factor but not the whole story.  Can you see everywhere around the car?  Is it comfortable to sit in but also to be a passenger? Can I hear music of my choice playing through a great sound system? Am I warm enough or cool enough? Does the car start immediately and without drama? And Rollin\\' Down the Highway with that smooth ride pulls it together.  I might even be shallow enough to admit that the car suits my self image.  But where oh where is a usb port? It doesn\\'t exist in this 2014 Audi Q5.  Some of us might even like to play things from an old ipod or charge our phones directly without the little lighter adapter. Bluetooth is fine but it\\'s just another interface. But I am still the Queen. audi awesome so far so good.  City mpg is 22.5.  This summer I\\'ll check the hwy mpg when I drive to the west coast.  Performance and comfort and top notch.  If I had to say anything negative it would be the fan controls for air temp is a 2-step process.  Also the steering wheel blocks the odometer and outside temp display.  I still haven\\'t figured out what the rear fog lamps are all about.  Nice driving car. Unexpected issues for a premium car Like mentioned in another review, the timing tensioner caused a check engine light to turn on at approx. 74K miles and after several times of resetting the light, it refused to go away. My dealership finally took it in and called me initially to repair it for $1,800, which they said if I don\\'t take care of will cost 8K worth of damage. They were not able to give me a cause for it and I told them to give me the quote and details and I will take it and fix it for cheaper elsewhere. Then they said they will contact Audi and call me back if anything can be done. After a few hours they called and said Audi would cover the entire cost and they repaired it within 24 hrs for no cost. I am happy they did that, but I am sure this has affected the value of my car and my fear of something else going wrong with it. I bought this car brand new thinking I will not have to deal will damages from low quality build and not including the regular maintenance I take it for, I have had to go to the dealership many more times for fixing recalls and other minor sensor issues. Right now my navigation and media system stopped working after they fixed the engine issue and I am not sure how to connect the two incidents. The dealerships have been pretty good , but I am highly disappointed with the low quality of the car itself. Beware timing chain tensioner at 75k miles!! The 2.0l engine has a poorly designed timing chain tensioner which is prone to failure around 75k miles - and will take your engine with it.  There is a class action lawsuit about the problem (google it).  The car also does not hold its value well - I’m told due to lack of reliability and sky high repair costs.  That said, until the timing chain failed it was fun to drive and had been pretty reliable.  However, at 74k miles when the timing chain tensioner failed, the engine repair costs exceeded the blue book value of the car (4.5 years old).  The navigation system was clunky, it had no USB ports, and poor user interface for such an expensive car. Love our new Audi Q5 I did a lot of shopping around for about three months.  Found this immaculate Audi Q4 at our Lancaster Mercedes dealership.  It was a leased car trade in - super shape and the dealership could not be more inspiring, helpful and great to work with.  After 3 months I found the car for us. Swweeeeeet So far this Q5 is awesome. Great ride, good performance and reasonable gas mileage. All round it handles like a car, has the storage for gear and groceries and the comfort of my living room. Love It!! The only issue I have with the Q5 is that it isn\\'t as quiet a ride as I expected. Although Audi dealership did try to do something about it, I tend to get wind noise in around the windows. The navigation system isn\\'t as intuitive as I hoped. Other than that, I absolutely love the car and may end up buying a newer model when I\\'m ready to get a new car. will keep till 80-90K,still excelrnt vehicle! Being picky, the only drawback to this fine car is the computer behind the nav system. Steep learning curve and not easily used info input system LUV my Q5!! Just buy it! You\\'ll luv it, too! Q5 Quality Has Gone Down Significantly Bought my 1st Q5 in 2010 (3.2, in Canada), and had to sell when we went overseas. Came back to US and leased a Q5 again since 1st time it was so great. But things have just gone downhill for Q5 quality:\\r- Check engine light came at 3000 miles\\r- Multiple trips to dealer to fix it\\r- Rear tire starting showing low pressure\\r- Again, multiple trips to fix it\\r- Other rear tire BURST...yes  just BURST on the highway at high speed....lucky to be not hurt\\r- Stayed for 30 mins on hold before Audi roadside assistance could finally help\\r- Got home and dealer basically not even responding to have the tire replaced ! No am not talking free....but a fully paid one from me? wtf !\\r  Brakes at 31,000 Miles At 31,000 miles, the dash indicator screen told me I needed brake pads. Over a third of those miles were put on during 2 road trips. Yet when I questions Audi both at the dealer leveland at the corporate level, I was told that on the Q5 & Q7 models, the brake pads must be replaced around 25,000 to 30,000 miles. I have owned many automobiles including 5 other Audi cars. I have never had to replace brakes at 25 - 35,00 miles Subaru Forester to Audi Q5 I was impressed and planned to upgrade to the top model \\'14 Subaru Forester XT after driving my \\'02 Forester for the past 12 yrs but after test driving the Audi Q5, the overall quality, detail, and refinement of Audi completely ruined the XT for me! For comparison the XT has more power (250 hp), better fuel economy (avg 25 mpg), greater cargo space (~75 cu ft), and costs ~$5000 less.No matter you can feel the superior quality and craftsmanship in material, workmanship, and engineering in every detail and step of the gas pedal in the Audi. I love the quick acceleration in Sport mode and the refined executive styling and boss 18\" wheels! I look fwd to and enjoy driving it each and every day! Art of Wheels We looked at a RX350, RDX, X3, SRX.This is the runaway winner.Great timeless design, wonderful interior design and material quality, great step in height and the list goes on.Bought this after owning a 2012 ML350.My wife is 5 foot and ML350 step in height too high.She loves this vehicle, great for a shorter person, perfect size.Have all options on ours except 19 inch wheels.Wish it had power tilt/telescoping wheel, probably only missing options.Very thoughtfully designed, seems overpriced but the devil is in the details.It was worth $8000 more than the RDX after sitting in both back to back.Have had it for a months and we love it, still like my BMW 550 more though! Upgraded CRV I recently purchased a Q5.I chose it as a medium option between the more expensive SUV\\'s (X5/ML/Cayenne) and the more economic CRV/4runner/CX5\\'s.In retrospect, I would categorize it with the second group and is overpriced for the quality.Peformance:Feels faster than it actually drives, particularly in the 50-70 range needed to merge onto major highways.The Q5 is fun to drive, until you look around and see that you\\'re not accelerating as quiickly as you think.Interior:Cheap leather and interior surfaces look more similar to an accord or CRV than a luxury SUV.The computer/MMI seems out of date and dial is tough to use.Panorama sunroof is too big and gimicky. Fantastic Automobile I had shopped around a bit in Los Angeles for the ideal car for my wife. She had very specific requirements for color and engine...tan or brown on brown and fast. There was only one brown on brown in the state at the time with the supercharged 6.We found Steve Miller at Santa Monica Audi on the internet who was enthusiastic about selling at my asking price of $3,000 off sticker-no questions, no hassle, bada bing! Since day one, the car has been a dream.Both of us drive the car, but she probably airs it out a little more.It is an SUV that thinks it\\'s a sports car. It\\'s a great car. No problems. Gives us a reason to go drive...even in LA. This is my 1st and will be my last Audi Bought the Q5 Premium Plus from Tony Peng at Penske Audi. Tony was very helpful, no presssure sales, very smoooth and enjoyable.The finance girl was no pressure either.Love my experience at the dealership, 5-star.I was debating between a BMW X3 and this Q5.What won my heart was its seat, very comfortable.The drive was smooth.This is the Pros.Cons?The navigation system is the WORST!It is so difficult to use that I ended up using my iPhone map/GPS which is FREE.The Audi system costs $4K!! At this price range, this system is totally un-acceptable.Advice for potential buyer:test the navigation system and be sure you accept its performance. Q5 3.0t Prestige Traded my 2008 base model Cayenne for the Q5 3.0 and so far (1 month later) it\\'s a great success.It\\'s just more fun to drive and I didn\\'t need as much cargo space.The 0-60 time, ride quality and sound system are all better in the Audi.And of course the agility and parking ease are better due to the smaller size.Audi MMI maybe has overkill on some features such as 8 different ways to enter a destination into the Nav so maybe there\\'s a little more money invested than absolutely necessary.Also better than the Lexus RX I had before the Porsche Great SUV great engine It\\'s a great car with a very powerful engine and agile. The Q5 has an impressive torque and can reach 100 km / h in just 5.9 seconds. It\\'s awesome. Its exterior lights have a very modern and sleek design. The interior finish and quality of materials are amazing. The start-stop system saves a lot of gas when traffic is heavy. Bang & Olufsen radio sounds spectacularly well, with great clarity and sound quality. wheel drive because it shows the car has really stuck to the road, giving great driving safety. Engine power is noticeable especially on steep climbs and road overtaking. The chassis structure is firm and sturdy and gives assurance and poise to handle the car. The Audi drive select syst Amazing...so glad I traded. I bought the Q5 on Monday after 7 disappointing months of driving a 2013 Volvo S60. I could not be happier. I test drove a few other smallish SUVs and this blew them all away. The interior is beautiful and logically set up. I love the panoramic sunroof, the sound-system and most definitely the bigger engine. I drove the 2.0 and could tell a difference and for me it was worth the price jump. The Audi dealer gave me excellent trade value for the Volvo and the transaction was painless.  Almost perfect car. After owning 11 different cars over time. This was the best overall! Best car I\\'ve ever owned I don\\'t have anything negative to write. Best value I\\'ve ever owned in my 54 yrs of driving. Go nonstop from Syracuse to Beaufort,SC (14 hrs) and my wife and I are not worn out by the trip... very comfortable and accommodating. Help is on the way This is my third update on a review posted shortly after I bought my 2014 Q5 TDI.  I loved the car then and I still do today, despite Audi\\'s diesel fiasco.Pros:1. This is a very comfortable car to sit in on the commute and long hauls. The front seats are great unless you want to pretend it\\'s a sports car, in which case they lack a bit of lateral support. The Q5 does its suburban transport function perfectly well and the panoramic roof glass gives it an airy feeling.  Like all the Audis in my experience, the driver\\'s sight lines are excellent.2. The fuel economy has gone from outstanding to somewhat higher than that.  In the same mixed driving pattern since purchase, I\\'m now averaging 31-33 mpg measured at the tank (the low end of that range in winter).  High 30s with pure highway driving.  For a 4400 pound truck with a 5000 pound towing capacity, that\\'s supernatural. 3. About that towing capacity; I still haven\\'t hauled any really heavy loads but the Q5 tows 1000 pounds of motorcycle plus trailer with barely any hit on fuel consumption.4. Driving dynamics are very good within limits.  Body roll is minimal for an SUV, the steering is reasonably quick and accurate without being nervous, braking effort is linear and absolute stopping power is good but not stellar.  Ride quality is quite good, striking an excellent balance of composed cornering without too stiff damping.  While I usually don\\'t ask much of the engine and rarely spin it above 1800 rpm, when acceleration is called for at any speed that initial torque surge is amazing.5. The Q5 is good in winter, particularly since I put on Nokian Hakkapeliitta winter tires (probably not needed but they provide more braking performance in snow).  Excellent ground clearance, the wheel wells don\\'t get packed up with snow and the traction control is effective without being intrusive.  It would be nice to have a locking center diff but the Quattro is perfectly fine for most snow conditions.  The defroster does a good job but it would help to have a windshield option as it does get packed up with snow and ice at the base and left side of the window.6. VWAG finally has a plan to deal with the 3.0 liter diesel scam and it looks good.  Last year I got a $500 debit card for any purchase and another $500 card to use exclusively at Audi dealerships.  Now they\\'re on the verge of recall the car to implement the fix, which appears to be limited to ECU reprogramming.  We will have to see if this adversely affects performance or fuel economy with no third party reports yet, as far as I know.  One cause for optimism is that a friend of mine with a Golf Sportwagen TDI had no degradation of mileage or performance after recent fix of his 2.0 liter I-4.  Audi will also evidently give me something in the range of $7000 compensation with a smaller amount coming from Bosch.  That will have a significant impact in cost of ownership (and might put me in a new Porsche Cayman or Corvette Grand Sport when I trade in my other car next year!).Cons:1. The steering has poor on-center feel which is a bit irritating when I set out on highway driving although after a bit of time I stop noticing it.2. While the stopping power is adequate, the initial brake feel is spongy.  I much prefer brakes that have a strong initial bite and linear rise in stopping power, like those on my Audi S4. 3. The defroster is adequate but in very snowy conditions it would be nice to have a heated windshield base or heated washer fluid.4. I would prefer to have engine stop start switch in a more intuitive position.  The system itself is not bad; the engine restarts quickly and smoothly.  But I only want to use it when I anticipate a relatively long stop, like arriving at a traffic light that has just turned red.  So I am turning the system on and off multiple times in local driving but it\\'s hard to find the switch without taking my eyes off the road.5. The interior trim on the driver\\'s side door and left front of the dashboard reflects sunlight on the instruments and windshield under some circumstances.  It\\'s an occasional minor irritation.  Overall, it\\'s hard to find much to complain about with this car! $55,000.00 Vibrator No, it will not be satisfactory for that either!  Seriously, I traded my 2002 Audi S8 which had massive engine failure at 118,000 miles for a new \\'14 TDI.  I commute from Tampa, FL to just beyond New Orleans, LA.  I was looking for the ability to tow a small trailer, get good mileage and like all wheel drive.  Seemed pretty good, but there was a huge catch.  Vibration.  There is something called vibration tolerance.   It seems the longer a human is subjected to vibrations, the more aggravating the particular vibrations (generally low in frequency) become.  Every trip I made (10 - 11 hours total trip time) I was feeling pretty bad upon completion, nauseous and jittery.  I\\'ve owned diesel cars before and have been a ship captain for many years.  I\\'m accustomed to diesels.  I\\'ve never had this issue before.  This is not something that could come as a surprise to engineers.  It is well known.  I got the impression that accountants were running the engineering.  It\\'s called \"Value Engineering\".   After being fully prepared to follow Florida Lemon Law, Audi corporate made be a generous offer to trade for a 2015 Audi SQ5.  Most regrettably I accepted this offer.  You may be interested in my review of the 2015 Audi SQ5 when posted.  At present I\\'m engaged with the Lemon Law process but suffice it to say I\\'m more convinced at ever that Value Engineering is the single overriding \"Truth\" in their engineering.  Highly NOT RECOMMENDED.Update:  None.  Glad to be done with VW/Audi!Update 7/2/18:   I am not sure how this has happened, but this review is for the Q5 TDI.  It now seems to be under a gasoline version. The best of all worlds Acceleration is terrific at any speed, torque equivalent is a big block V8. Gas mileage is outstanding. Getting calculated 37MPG on a long trip is common. I\\'m averaging 32.2MPG in 18,000 miles of ownership. Traction is outstanding with quattro. OEM Michelin Latitude\\'s are ok, not great, so I think traction could be further improved with better tires. Shifting is smooth in all gears, although the shift from 1 to 2 only after the idle stop was engaged is the slightest bit rough. Interior materials are first rate, layout is very intuitive. MMI is very good, nav takes a few minutes to start up on initial startup, I really like the LACK of a touch screen nav system. Everything is controlled through the selector wheel and buttons, Hands are closer to the wheel, no stretching for the nav screen and less eyes off the road. Cargo capacity is ok, but you know that buying this vehicle - if you need a Suburban, go buy a Suburban.Audi\\'s tend to be a bit more sporty than the Mercedes, and on par with BMW. Consequently the ride is never harsh, but a bit firmer than you may be used to coming out of a Merc, or certainly a Lexus, which places a higher priority of comfort over better handling. Having said that, this is a heavy vehicle and center of gravity will be higher than any sedan you compare it to. Comparing this size SUV to any other comparably sized SUV, it\\'s hard not to like everything it offers. Price is a reflection of the technology, materials, and performance you get, which is to say, it doesn\\'t come cheap.Comfort, room, performance, fuel efficiency, quality of materials, and build quality, Compare it to anything you like, you won\\'t find everything this vehicle - as a TDI - delivers anywhere else. Love the TDI, Skip the MMI package Fun car to drive. The diesel engine is amazing, especially on long journeys. The acceleration is fantastic, very good for road trips as well as battling the everyday commute.\\r The MMI is total crap. Voice recognition doesn\\'t recognize much, and the navigation takes far too long to start up. I\\'ve given up using it. The stereo system is a bit on the quiet side, even with the B&O package. Agile and sporty but not a sedan I have had my 2014 Q5 TDI for around 6 months now so feel comfortable writing a review. Overall it\\'s a great car: it\\'s fun to drive and it feels agile and sporty. The mileage is generally better than advertised: we took a 2,000 mile road trip this summer and with 4 people and luggage we averaged just under 37 MPG -- going through the Canadian Rockies. I liked this car better than the other smaller SUVs I test-drove (Lexus, Cadillac, BMW.) On the down side, the steering can feel remote and the center of gravity is definitely higher than my 2000 Mercedes E 320 sedan (or maybe I\\'m just used to it) I ordered all of the options, including the tow hitch, which made the car rather expensive.  So much to love but so many annoyances! This car handles terrifically; as smooth and responsive as any BMW or Lexus I\\'ve owned.  The diesel has so much low end torque that you\\'ll blow off kids in hot cars without meaning to.  The car is beautiful and comfortable and the sound system excellent.  All that being said, I\\'ll never buy another Audi based on this car.   The car \\'lags\\' when trying to accelerate just a little from an already-slow speed (like turning at an intersection with pedestrians; or waiting for a break in oncoming cars while turning) leaving you in dangerous situations at times.  The electronics are WAY behind the curve: you have to take your eyes off the road and hand off the wheel for FAR too much.   NOW of course there\\'s the whole matter of the diesel engine polluting the air up to 40 times the legal limit.  As if there wasn\\'t enough to dislike about the car already....... Driving the 2014 Audi Q5 I have been extremely satisfied with my Q5 Prestige 3.0 TDI .  The car is fun to drive, has lots of power and gets excellent mileage.  For the last 37,000 miles I have averaged over 35 miles per gallon.  This includes both town and highway driving.  (Town driving is approximately 30 MPG and highway is near 40 MPG.) Known Navigation problem that Audi will not tell you I own the 2014 Audi Q5 TDI for 6 months. Love everything in this car except MMI. Recently discovered a problem with Navigation - sometimes, it looses GPS signal and when re-acquires, it recalculates your position by 1-2 miles off your real location. MMI reset does not help. All that helped so far, is to stop the car, turnoff the ignition, and wait for 10-15 minutes. AUDI is aware of this problem, but has no solution. Today, after 6 month of very gentle use, I have only 6K miles on the car, its rear view camera stopped working, shows green chaotically blinking stripes and rectangles. I am very disappointed. I planned to keep the car, but now I am glad that I leased it first.  TDI engine is a superstar I cross-shopped the Q5 against the X3 35i, XC60 T6, Range Rover Sport, and Cayenne.All had their strengths, but I fell in love with the Q5\\'s TDI engine.In short, it provides the best of both worlds.It explodes off the line like a rocket thanks to its considerable low end torque, but also returns fantastic mpg, often reaching 35 mpg on the highway.I had no idea diesels were so much fun -- I preferred it to the petrol inline sixes in the XC60 and X3.You can get the same basic TDI engine in the Cayenne, but it\\'s at least $20k premium over a similarly equipped Q5.And just so you don\\'t think I\\'m too easy of a grader when I say it \"explodes\" off the line, I\\'m coming from a C63 AMG. 2014 Premium Plus TDI Our Q5 TDI is only four days old and already impresses. Premium Plus with MMI, B&O sound system, tow hitch and side assist.Per the computer that might be optimistic, we got 37 mpg on the mainly highway trip home from the dealer.Managed 33 mpg on the way into work (uphill) and 37 mpg on the way home.The OEM tow hitch is a clean install and they gave me a color matched insert for the back bumper if I ever get rid of the hitch. The auto stop system is not intrusive. Power and efficiency Audi Q5 TDI Premium Plus, Scuba Blue/Chestnut interior with ash inlays.Car had to be ordered and delivery took 82 days which felt like an eternity. The engine response is very good, but like the articles there is a very slight lag.It has no affect on any real world merge or passing situation IÂ\\x92ve encountered. The first 350 miles have been about 100 miles in town and 250 miles on an Interstate Highway road trip (70 mph). The in town mileage was around 24 mpg and overall for the 350 miles it was 31.4 mpg.Uses auto-shutdown but the start-up is very fast so there is no issue about keeping people waiting behind you.This function can be turned off from the dash. Audi Q5 TDI - Better mileage than advertised My new 2014 Audi Q5 TDI has a little over 1700 miles. I\\'ve been very careful during the break-in period, which happened during extreme cold temperatures and much snow and ice on the roads for a few weeks in February. The car would start flawlessly every time even at temperatures of -20 F in the mountains of Colorado. I\\'ve averaged 25.5 mpg in the city during cold weather and snowy roads. On a 180 mile round trip from Winter Park to Steamboat Springs, where you start at 8800 ft, go down to 7000, then up to almost 11,000 ft and then down to 6,800 ft I averaged 35 mpg with 5 people in the car, skis on the roof and a fully loaded trunk. From Boulder to Colorado Springs and back I averaged 41.5 MPG.Update: After owning this vehicle for two years I\\'m just hoping it is not too good to be true with the diesel scandal. I bought it because it had power and speed to spare while using very little fuel and polluting less than a gasoline car. That may still be true for CO2 emissions, but it is not true for NOx emissions, and that is very disappointing. I\\'m hoping the fix will not reduce my power or fuel economy. I\\'ve averaged almost 31 mpg over 25,000 miles, with no mechanical or electrical problems. My biggest complain is the Google Earth based GPS. The time to arrival algorithm is not very accurate, especially when driving in the mountains. It can be 30 minutes off on a two hour drive. In the city though, it is accurate enough.I bought snow tires to get one more season out of the all seasons it came with, but I still think the original tires will not last as long as expected. The Audi Q5 is excellent in the snow with these new snow tires. I did notice an appreciable difference in traction, but it does not corner as well as with the all seasons, as expected.Last year we drove the car from Colorado to California and from Colorado to the East Coast. It was such a pleasure we may do it again this year. The seats get a bit hard after 6 hours drive, so we bought a seat cushion for long trips after the first one and our bottoms thanked us.Update: The major change I\\'ve seen is my mileage has increased to an average of 31.6 of combined driving in the third year, from 30.8 the first year. I don\\'t know if that\\'s due to the engine loosening up and becoming fully burned in, or because the original tires are getting worn out. I have 34,000 miles and I have measured up to 40.5 MPG on one trip. Usually the computer is off by up to 1 mpg, so figure at least 38-39 mpg on the highway through 3 Colorado mountain passes.I hope Audi can fix the diesel cheating problem without affecting performance. I don\\'t know of any other car that can perform similarly or better (range, MPG, AWD, ground clearance, acceleration, comfort, luxury, quality). Maybe next year the plug-in hybrid can come close or surpass it.Update (Mar 26, 2017): Audi may offer to buy back my 3.0 TDI Audi Q5 if they cannot solve the diesel problems by December 2017. I would take them up on the offer if I could find another vehicle that performed equally or better than what I have for a similar price. I don\\'t think there is one, if I want similar range (600+ miles), acceleration (6.2 sec 0-60 mph), fuel efficiency (30.8 MPG combined, down a bit because of the use of snow tires), road clearance (7.9 in) , turning diameter (38.1 ft), and combination of length and cargo space on an AWD car. I am very happy with this vehicle after 38,500 miles but I don\\'t want the pollution stigma. 2014 Q5 TDI Owner Long-term Report At 38,000-miles and just over 3-years of ownership, the Q5 TDI still impresses! It\\'s a pleasure to drive, comfortable, handles extremely well and love the torque produced by the TDI engine. The diesel mileage is impressive for a car of this size. Still getting 30mpg overall and on the interstate mileage is in the mid-30s. Audi will not be getting this car back - this is a keeper!08/13/2017 Update:  Completed a 3,400-mile road-trip this past June. A lot of interstate driving and driving through Colorado mountains. Car performed flawlessly! The car is comfortable and powerful and was maxed-out load wise for part of the trip. Carried luggage for 4-people! Absolutely no mechanical issues. Interstate mpg with cruise at 78-mph returned 34-mpg. As I said before, Audi will not be getting this car back - this is a keeper!02/14/1018 Update:  No issues. Finally got the \"diesel fix\" recall notice from Audi. Don\\'t really want to make the fix but will do it and take  their generous monetary compensation. After fix, expect a 1mpg reduction in fuel economy. Original pads and rotors lasted to 55K service! Q5 - great drive, poor comfort  No spare and no run flats.   What i love:seeing the motor shut off when going down the hills-even at 70mph. Electric only until I press down too hard.  I\\'ve got two cars-- a hybrid + a regular Q5. Exquisite premium plus SUV for all conditions A surefooted stable all weather utilitarian vehicle that is sporty yet smooth as molten butter and as stylishly luxurious as value would allow. The panorama sun/moonroof lets the light in making the already spacious cabin look even more so and inviting for your guests. For the price point, it is a smooth cruiser but one can wake up the beast by shifting to S mode. I was crossshopping current year lexus NX, Mercedes GLC (and GLK), and BMW X6 at higher price points and they did not deliver the versatile appeal yo the driver senses as the Q5 could. Although I bought mine pre-owned at high highway miles, there is no doubt it still feels and runs like new. The interior fit and finish have held up well indicative of the attention of detail befitting a German luxury mobile. The cons are that because the standard suspension is fairly sporty and firm, rough roads may be felt more but its manageable. If you can, find a Q5 with adaptive dampers and audi drive select and youll have 3+ cars of feel in one! Also, this MY has piston and ring oil consumption issues as well as timing chain tensioner flaws. Luckily it was fixed in mine. Do your due diligence and find one that has these fixes done and car will be bulletproof. MY and minor facelift (2009-2012s look better in my opinion) 2013+ Q5s seem to have these fixes done so could save you a headache. Overall, amazing bargain for the price. Way more car for money than buying a new car with steep depreciation or an econobox that is more of an appliance. We spend so many hours in our residences, places of work AND in our car and we care/indulge majorly in the former 2 so why not treat yourself with world class commuting comfort, utility and technology. Caveat: as with most nice things, just pay a little more :] Rather fight than switch!!! Once you drive an Audi, you will never want to drive anything else. Well appointed,stylish inside and out. Quick acceleration and safety,safety, safety. One of the safest vehicles on the road. I own an A4 and the Q5 premium. I love my Audis\\'. Ticked Off Just purchased my 2011 Q5 approximately a month ago.  Did my due diligence before I purchased it, and had it inspected.  Was only told it needed a new oil filter and oil, but everything else looked good. Took it o Audi for the 35K mile check up and added a couple extras to the inspection to make sure. Again, no issues...until a week later when my air conditioner wouldn\\'t work. Turns out I had to get a new blower motor.  Following week, the car is hesitating and the engine light comes on, so need to take it in again. THEN, we take it in for a car wash and the person knocks the rear view mirror off...have to replace the ENTIRE windshield. WTF??? I really wish I would have seen this page before I purchased this vehicle.  NOT HAPPY!! Unreliable - Expect Major Repairs Every 15K or So I have had several reliability issues with my 2011 Audi Q5 over the years, including: (1) Excessive oil consumption eventually leading to the replacement of engine pistons and rings (which Audi covered, thankfully), (2) Multiple mechanical and electrical issues that have prevented the vehicle from either starting or driving, requiring the vehicle to be towed multiple times, along with multiple (and very expensive) repairs from the Audi dealerships. Seriously, it seems like every 6-12 months another random issue pops up that renders the vehicle undriveable. I hold my breath each time I start it just waiting for the next warning light and four-figure Audi bill. Also worth mentioning that the jack is much too small for the vehicle and the spare tire is deflated (note the jack slipped when I was changing the tire in 2014 and crushed my left hand, leading to a trip to the ER and physical therapy; it remains sore and swollen to this day). Audi is not the \"Truth in Engineering\" I have had my Audi Q5 in the Audi service department 4 times over the last 6 months.  This time it broke down on me 2 weeks after Audi stated it was fixed.  Well, now they are telling me I need a new engine at the cost of $14,700.  They will not take responsibility for their mistakes or mis-diagnosis.  They said that is was a cracked head and that Audi does not issue replacement parts.  It has to be a complete new engine.  Not only has my car been in the service department for 2 months, Audi had the mechanic remove the cover and look a bit further.  I did not authorize anything to be done.  They still have my car and now have told me that they will not help with their mistakes.  Now I have no car and no answers.  The oil consumption is another issue all together.  1 quart per 750 miles.  I spent more money on oil than gas.  But as always, they say its normal.  The airbags in my Q5 are on the recall list.  Audi however, will not issue a recall.  They have left us hanging and has put mine and my families life in danger.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do  your research before purchasing any Audi product!UPDATE:  we have the audi towed to a private mechanic that said it was the timing chain tensioners and if that were fixed my car would run. Per audi the engine is blown. These people are crooks. Disappointed Beyond Belief After purchasing 4 Audi\\'s from the same dealership I am at a loss for words.We bought an extended warranty to 100,000 miles.We had ongoing issues with oil and at 82,000 miles the pistons were replaced.At 103,000 they now tell us, after all services were performed at the dealership,there is a problem with the engine compression.They say it is our problem.Wow, I spent over $42,000 on a car that now will require a new engine and is over the warranty by 3,000 miles.I thought Audi was a premium brand that stood behind its product and appreciated a loyal customer.I guess 4 car purchases does not count for much these days.I don\\'t think I\\'ll be buying nor recommending Audi ever again Great Overall Small CUV/SUV Have owned my 2.0T Premium Plus for 5 months now.Waited until honeymoon phase was over to write review.Coming from an 08 Infiniti G35xS to this, so big change.Wife drives an Infiniti XQ56 so I don\\'t need anything larger.Grew tired of \"G\"cramped interior, lack of cargo/storage, road noise, no fold-down seats and gas mileage.Looked strictly for smaller CUV that was fun to drive, AWD, handled well, had good power, some decent cargo while maintaining the mpg\\'s.Cross-shopped FX35, SRX, Touareg and X3.Love Q5!! For 2011 model year you had choice between 2.0T of 3.2.The 3.2 sucks more gas, lacks low-end torque and add over 200lbs. to car.ZERO issues with oil consumption.  2011 Audi Q5 Love the car. Haven\\'t used a drop of oil in over 40,000 miles.Added a new exhaust system, made a big difference in performance 3.5 years, 58k miles and counting. Purchased new 2011 2.0T with sunroof, no Navi. I use this suv all the time - lots of hiway miles, some offroad/farm tracks, vet errands, cross country. Need the SUV format. 1st set of OEM Tires lasted about 45k, new Pirellis I think are even better. I keep a qt of SynthOil in the boot, in 3 years have added 4 quarts total - glad mine\\'s not unique, and seriously people, this is not among life\\'s major problems considering all the positives. Lifetime MPG is 24.7. Audio/iPod/Sat is great. Cargo is functional, plenty of passer space.It\\'s a solid efficient SUV, I don\\'t know what I would get instead. I do have a soft spot for that Subaru/dog commercial, but Q5 suits me for work and after work. Disappointed  Bought a Q5 in 2010 August. While this is a great car to drive, problems with the oil consumption ( it is a major irritant) and brake pads ( I have done 47 K miles) and have them elaced twice. What is truly disappointing with Audi is the way the company and dealership have washed their hands of these issues. I used to own a BMW before shifting to an Audi, but this is definitely the last Audi I would ever buy Fantastic value for a luxury vehicle I have owned this CPO 2011 Q5 for 6 years now and it is a pleasure to drive. Lovely ride, good service by the dealer although I had extended warranty up to 100k miles. There were 5 issues over the years - one is a broken sunvisor which was replaced free of charge, a leak/gap in a body panel that caused water to come in...this was also addressed through a technical bulletin and repaired free of charge, a fuel pump sensor, PRV, hood latch sensor, all were fixed under warranty. Build quality could be better and I was told that Audi is working on it. I am a cautiously optimistic Audi fan but the only Audi\\'s I buy will be CPOs since they come with extended warranty. 2.0T oil consumption I got this car relaying on Audi brand . I\\'m very disappointed that info about excessive oil consumption in these engines was available before. We are going back for refill oil every 1,200 miles.That is very annoying. Dealer does everything to accommodate us including free car wash. They claim this if within tolerance.We see dozens of disappointed Audi owners there.DO your research before you buy.There is more and more info online about this problem. What the sales people don\\'t tell you. My Audi Q5 burns about 1 quart every 4K miles and we\\'ve owned it for about 1 1/2 years and has 22,000 miles. Audi says that as long as it\\'s not more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles it\\'s ok and in the mean time they won\\'t do anything. Moreover, in the owner\\'s manual (page 273) it states the following under the oil consumption section: \"Depending on the way the vehicle is driven and the operating conditions, oil consumption can be up to ½ quart per 600 miles. Consumption may be higher within the first 3,000 miles.\"I expect more from a $50,000 car and Audi is washing their hands off on this issue.If we had know, we would have bought another car. Still loving my Q5 after 15k miles! I have put 15k miles on my Q5 since taking delivery just over 8 months ago, and I am loving it!The design is great inside and out -- an extremely handsome car.The interior fit and finish is impressive, especially the special order ash wood inlays.The Bose audio, built-in nav and Bluetooth systems are all great.The Q5 handles very well for an SUV -- very car-like, and the 3.2 L V-6 is very smooth.The transmission responds well whether driving leisurely or aggressively.The S setting on the PRNDL really kicks it up a notch by holding gears to redline during acceleration. 2.0T Q5 Quiet, comfortable daily driver.Averaging about 24mpg.Love the steering (easy to turn in parking lots and slow turns). No effort to drive.Would not like this in a sports car, but works well in this application.  Replacement for my Beloved Audi Allroad After driving (and loving) my Audi Allroad for 6 years - I was looking for a replacement.Didn\\'t expect to convert to the \"Q\" but after looking at my alternatives outside of Audi I became a believer.Had looked at the BMW X6 (great drive but too expensive for what you get) as well as the Volvo XC70 (only Allroad alternative...but not) and new Porshe Cayenne (no GTS) - but kept coming back to Audi (this is my 6th).I finally sat in a Q5 and realized what a good fit it was.Roomy interior (no kids so back seat doesn\\'t impact me) - and enough storage.I opted for the 3.2 engine as I highway drive and need the power. Inside quality/design/technology are pure Audi. Ride is smooth and quiet. First Audi, not my last if it holds up. Traded a 1998 ML320 for a 2011 2.0T base model. Looked at new and used diesel ML\\'s, Touareg, Highlander Hybrid, Venza, Pilot, MDX: Q5 was way better, especially on a twisty road. Amazing zip for a 4, and awesome brakes! 3000 miles to date and no problems. Really fun to drive compared to prior suv\\'s, including ML, Pathfinder and Volvo XC 70. Plenty of power driving over the Cascades from the valley, and passing on the interstates. 31 mpg at 65-75 mph on a recent 400 mile trip down I -5, fully loaded with 4 people and luggage. Base sound system with ipod is more than adequate. Panoramic sun roof doesn\\'t cause interior overheating in the Northwest with temps to 90. Couldn\\'t be happier so far. Good looking car, poor build quality and horrible service Under 15K mi & water pump went out, front brake pads need to be replaced, wipers already shot (I live in SoCal & the vehicle is garaged) & I have the backseat constant rattle that Audi will not fix.We were just about to drive through the desert before the water pump failure...that Audi didn\\'t warn us about.Instead, it ruined our trip & they washed our car for the inconvenience.They also deny that there is a problem with the seat rattle.Just do a search on it & you will see all the problems so many are experiencing.Now, I have to use duct tape to muffle a rattle that Audi will not fix on its 45K vehicle that is still under warranty.This is my second Audi and my last. Money pit! Best In Class We got tired of our 2008 Audi TT 3.2 sports car (fun but impractical) and traded it in for a 2011 Q5 2.0L with the Premium Plus package. We could not be happier with this vehicle. It is far superior to the competition with a great blend of style, luxury, comfort, and economy. The electronics are phenomenal. The displays are sharp and crisp. Ride is a perfect blend of tautness and comfort - just returned from a 400-mile round-trip. Interior is extremely quiet. Perfect size, lots of leg room and plenty of rear storage.Getting close to 30mpg at $4.00 plus per gallon saves a lot of gas money.Dealership experience at Audi of Fairfield (CT) was terrific. 2011 3.2 Q5 Prestige Pckg  After doing a LOT of research and test driving we kept coming back to the Q5. There is nothing else quite like when you combine looks, features and performance. We liked the 2.0 engine but the 3.2 has no lag and it is silky smooth. Now, after hearing about the oil usage of the 2.0 we are very glad we chose the 3.2. Yes the gas mileage is not quite as good but we are ok with that. Out performs MPG estimates I am an Acura MDX driver who was tired of limited leg room for the driver. The Q5 is smaller but has a longer wheel base and has removed the irritating foot pedal that played havoc with my shin bone with a simple lever on the center console.Start, stop, set parking brake within inches of each function. The prestige styling is to my likingand performance with the 3.2L engine has exceeded my expectations in both power and mileage.My entire music library is available by simply cable connecting my ipod in the glove box;simple lead thru on the car\\'s 7\" screen. Watch out for the 2.0T Engines I tried to do as much research as possible and every review kept pointing to the Audi 2011 Q5 with the 2.0T as the best at this time.So I bought one.The ride is excellent, gas mileage is very good, the fit and finish is excellent but now comes the big issue.The car burns oil at a very high rate.At 4000 miles I had to add a full quart of oil.The manual says it can burn 1 qt. every 600 miles so I guess that mean at almost every fill up of gas put a qt of oil in.That sounds ridiculous.I called 3 dealers and all said yes it does burn a lot of oil.Well that is just not acceptable so I sold it got a Toyota Rav4 4WD with more power, more cargo room and does not burn oil. Audi dealership quality I bought this 2011 2.0T premium plus for my wife and she absolutely loves it. The car is comfortable, quiet and suits us well. But there seems to be a little bit of transmission lag when the car pulls away in the mornings. Very subtle and goes away. This is strange for a $40K car! I also bought a 2011 Acura RDX 2 weeks afterward, which IMO is more fun to drive and accelerates faster. Interestingly, the dealers could not differ anymore. The guys at Acura of Boston (Perry and Niso) were extremely nice, h elpful and there were 2-3 calls following the sales to check in. Benardi Audi tried to get me into paying a higher finance rate and never called once to follow up.  Wonderful vehicle I told my wife the other day that I actually look forward to my commute just so that I can drive this amazing vehicle.The ride, quiet, handling, performance, wiz-bang gizmo\\'s, styling... these are all first rate. I compared many cars and kept going back to this one. It took me nearly 6 months to make a decision, and I have NO regrets. Complaints from reviewers about the overly complicated Nav system were obviously written by Luddites. It works wonderfully (except for what I wrote below). The feel and drivability of this car is outstanding. The other vehicles in it\\'s class just don\\'t compare. Maybe it\\'s just a matter of taste, but the Q5 is all good taste. LOVE THIS CAR Long-time BMW driver who was looking for a new experience...I found it with this amazing car. Fantastic handling, great power, good build quality, supreme comfort. The technology in this car was also a big seller for me (MMI/nav system is awesome).I had wanted to buy a Volvo Xc60, as I like the sporty looks of that SUV (and the understatement of driving a Volvo). However, compared to the Q5, the Volvos\\' interior and ride quality were totally lacking. This car handles like a sports coupe, and it is just so much fun to drive. Also looked at the new x3, sadly BMW missed the mark with the styling of that new release.  Audi Q5 2.0T Premium Plus - No Need for V-6 What a great vehicle!We bought a new Q5 2.0T for my wife to replace her 12 year old Lexus RX.We couldn\\'t be happier so far and love everything about the car from styling to performance to value (under $40K).The Q5 was the runaway winner after comparing to the new RX (what is wrong with Lexus??!!), Volvo XC60, Infiniti EX and FX, Cadillac SRX, LR2, and MB GLK among others.(We looked at everything except the BMW X3, which wasn\\'t available yet in December and we knew would be ridiculously priced anyway).The 2.0T will provide the best fuel economy and more than enough power - a shock to me.I would have never through a 4 cylinder could power an SUV like this one. Best car I\\'ve ever owned... so far. I\\'ve owned many cars; (in no particular order) VW\\'s, Ford\\'s, Subaru\\'s, Infinity, Lexus, etc. I have never had a car that was more enjoyable to drive, be in, or look at. It handles so very well on wet, dry, bumpy, smooth, pavement, uphill or flat. It\\'s quick and tight. But it\\'s also very comfortable and plush. The seats are amazingly comfortable and supportive. Visibility is wonderful.It\\'s got the Nav., which I was hesitant to get, but now LOVE! The Audio system is great, especially the iPod dock and controls.Got the \\'Teak\\' with the Cardamon (beige) leather. Gorgeous! I\\'ve never had a brown car, and this is a real beauty.So far... so good. I\\'ve had it less than one week. Look Out BMW and Mercedes I ordered a Premium Plus 2011 exactly to my specs with B&O stereo (worth every penny), 19\" wheels, hitch, and navigation.Quartz Gray w/ Cinnamon interior.The Q-5 blew away my expectations.With 12,000+ miles it is consistently delivering 28 mpg on the highway. Amazing!Also ordered special Audi package 20\" wheels with Pirelli Scorpion Zero Asymetrico all-season aftermarket tires on it.WOW!The car tracks like an arrow and looks fantastic.The interior functions are laid out better than any vehicle I have ever driven.Don\\'t need to take your eyes off the road for any reason. Great SUV This is our 4th Audi and it\\'s our favorite one.We had a Q7 and it was awesome, but a bit too big for us.We went down to an A3 and it was too small.However, the Q5 fits in the middle and it suits our needs perfectly.I can\\'t get over how fun it is to drive the Q5 and it drives very much like a car.It\\'s a very practical car and we think it\\'s awesome! First rate ride I just traded in my wife\\'s 2008 Platnium Toyota Sequoia for this small more manageable Audi.Having been a fan of Audi\\'s for the last few years, I drive an A8L, thought she would enjoy being able to step into, instead of climbing up into, a luxury vehicle.She is extremely satisfied with how the car handles, the excellent visibility, and the smooth power train, not to mention the upgrade to the bang and olfsen sound system. Audi is the vehicle to challenge all others. Soooo much better than the X3 I bought a used 2010 X3, drove it for three weeks and hated it. Rode like a brick on concrete wheels (ultrastiff).I\\'ve owned BMW\\'s before and can say that the X3 is a complete mess.Returned it to dealer who gave me full value back - thanks Carmax. Having success years ago with an A4, I test drove the Q5 and bought it on the spot. A similarly equipped unit from Benz or BMW would be thousands more. BTW - A voluntary recall is in effect for the 2011 Q5 and it deals with a computer update that improves transmission shifting. (downshifting was a bit rough).Existing inventory on dealers lots should already be updated. The update on mine did the trick and the trans works perfectly Sweet Machine This is a sweet handling, tight, good looking personal utility vehicle (PUV).The size is right and the 2.0t engine/8 speed transmission combination is like driving a Swiss watch.The power/torque curves in the 1500-3500 RPM range we live in are actually stronger than the 3.2 V-6.It handles and rides like an A4 but hauls anything you want to haul.The panoramic sunroof is stunning, and the feature content of the base model is all you need. If only it had a better transmission After 1500 miles a few observations about the car. While overall a nice ride, it is hampered by the 8 speed tranny. It stutters and can be very harsh at low speeds (under 10mph). It feels similar to a car that is sputtering at idle, although it is coming from the transmission, not the engine. The tranny also is constantly shifting, and the sport mode doesn\\'t seem to make it any \"smarter\" at gear selection, it just holds it for higher revs. My Sienna minivan provides smarter, smoother, quicker shifts (how\\'s that for an insult?).    Fabulous vehicle We recently purchased a 2011 Q5 3.2.  I am very pleased with our purchase.  My last three vehicles were a BMW X3, a BMW X5, and a VW Tiguan.  The Q5 has the convenient size of the X3 with superior handling, the luxury and comfort of the X5, and the biggest surprise it has better gas mileage than the Tiguan.  Audi Raleigh has treated us like life long customers and definitely make us feel like we matter.  A world class vehicle from a world class dealer.  Thanks Audi and Audi Raleigh. Exactly what I needed I drove a 2500 chevy silverado for the past 4 years, driving over 60 miles a day to school and back.  I questioned whether I would need the pick up function of my pick up truck, but I do not miss it one bit.  I test drove all the other new vehicles and this one out classes them all. I spend my winters in VT at the ski hills and the Q5 is very sure footed.  I have zero regrets, I LOVE the Audi Q5. Awesome, fun to drive Audi! Soccer Mom looking for more fun while getting close to \"mid-life crisis!\"  Got the fun back!  Wow, love the power and handling and feel of this drive.  With hardly any inventory around, had to take the offered package 2.0T premium plus and love it.  Sporty, luxury, can\\'t-take-my-eyes-off-of-it beauty!  Tight space inside but the sacrifice is worth it.  Not getting the mileage yet that I was hoping for and premium gas pricey but still worth it! Hope the Audi \"quality\" holds up over the years.  A little concerned about a big hiccup feeling when slowing down towards stop sign (outcome of drive-by-wire?). Interested to know what that is and why and is the car okay?  Overall, very pleased with Q5 Wow! It was time to replace our Grand Cherokee & had pretty much settled on the new Caddy SRX.  Then, we actually drove one and left the lot horribly disappointed.  But the Audi Q5 Prestige?  Wow!  This car has power, even on the worst San Francisco hills, handles like a Porsche, but rides beautifully, and is so crammed with features that you can\\'t list them all.  It\\'s been a \"head turner\" too.  The feel of well engineered quality is there everywhere you look.  We are elated over this car which seems to perform well above its competitors and doesn\\'t have the \"run-of-the-mill\" feel that most of them have.  Highly recommended. New 2011 Q5 2.0T After driving the Q5 in V6 form several times I was glad to see the 2.0T come out for 2011.  It definitely sounds like a 4 cylinder (albeit a smooth one) and the new 8sp transmission does need to shift more often to keep up to speed. But overall I am extremely happy with the Q5 in 2.0T trim.  It drives like a car with great handling and a quiet, smooth ride.  I have the Premium Plus with standard 18\" wheels as well as the Nav package and B&O Stereo.  So far a great vehicle. New 2011 Q5 2.0T The 2.0T engine in the Q5 seems more than adequate to me.  It seems almost as fast as the V6 with considerably better gas mileage.  It is also quiet and refined for a 4 cyl turbo.  The vehicle is screwed together extremely well and is a pleasure to drive.  Did not know if I would like a CUV after having many sport sedans but so far it is a great handling vehicle. Loving my new Q5 I have never owned a crossover vehicle before, We\\'ve had the Q5 3.2 Premium Plus w/navigation for a few days now and I have found myself taking the long way home whenever I can. It drives much like a car...handles great and and has a nice turn radius.I love the quietness of the car when your inside with the windows closed it\\'s well soundproofed.   Cross country tourer, urban worker  Superb driving dynamics,  I last owned an Audi in 1998, and everything has moved well ahead.  Also owned FX35, RDX. This is better than both on sheer driving satisfaction - fast, quiet, comfortable, roomy, competent and handles great.  28mpg on a 2,700 mile cross country trip to LA, over the Rockies. Panorama roof and screen were fine, and quite enjoyable under varied conditions.  Opted against Navi, not a 3d fan and in 5yrs, resale on Navi I am betting will not be worthwhile given many great options emerging on handhelds.  Love the 2.0t and also the 8 sp and the S drive choice is quite a good aggressive option for urban cut and thrust.  Roomy, efficient, and beautiful. Big ups for the Q5. My Best Car Purchase Yet After researching dozens of cars for months, I decided to visit my local Audi dealer to check out the Q5.  I was immediately in love with this car.  The design is beautiful,fit and finish is amazing.  The engine is smooth and powerful.  Audi has a real winner with the Q5.  AUDI Q5 fun to drive I have only driven this car for two weeks and am thrilled with it. Two most outstanding attributes is it\\'s performance and comfort. The torque generated from this engine is incredible. You feel as though you are driving a car with a lot more horsepower. The size and pep make it so much fun to drive.   Happy with  I moved from a Mercedes ML350 to the Q5.  I went with the 2.0T over the 3.2, it seemed more fun to drive and I like the turbo sound when it kicks in.  The vehicle is quiet (not as quiet as the ML) and the ride is very nice, firm yet quiet and solid.  The steering is good but I wish it was more tight like the Mercedes and the BMW. The handling is superb, much more car like than truck like. The comfort is very good, the seats are much better than the Mercedes and it seems like there are more adjustment options.  I wish there was a little more thigh support.  The rear seats are a little thin and there is not much leg room but not an issue for me. Gas mileage looking promising, I got 24 combo. One sweet ride This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. It drives very smooth with plenty of power for a 4 cylinder.The build quality is up there with Mercedes & BMW. I had a 2003 Acura MDX and paid more for the Acura. The Audi Q5 as far as I am concerned is a lot of bang for your buck. Loving it Comparing to most of the SUV, the ride is so much smoother and quiet. Handling is excellent. Pick up is good with lots of power. I love the sporty look and gorgeous design. I love the new color \"Teak Brown\", it is cool, elegant and unique. Although the price is slightly higher than other competitors, it is still worth it. Can\\'t go wrong with the German technology. Don\\'t need the V-6 My girlfriend and I drove both the 3.2 and 2.0T, needless to say we went for the 2.0T. This engine delivers more torque than the V-6 and torque is what drives power to the wheels. The 2.0 felt more tossable and having 8-speeds vs. 6-speeds made this vehicle a blast to drive. So far we are averaging 22 mpg combined driving. We also cross shopped the Mercedes GLK and Acura RSX but none of these other vehicles felt close with respect to interior comfort features. Looks and Performance Audi has a winner For people who want a zippy crossover with great mileage and luxury. Excellent handling, smooth ride, Navigation and Bluetooth are easy and very driver friendly.  Nice to Drive I sold my MB C230 to buy an SUV, I was undecided about the Q5, but searching through similar vehicles ( Toureg, X3, and GLK350) I\\'m sure I didn\\'t make a mistake. My Rocket Ship Went to buy new Ferrari, saw R8 and saved over $150,000, and got same performance. We ove our R* spyder! We hope they cahnged the fact that the radio turns on every time you start the car! Otherwise, superb. Audi R8 First 3 Months Review This car is simply amazing in every regard except fuel economy, but I guess that is to be expected with this caliber of vehicle. Styling and Performance are incredible. Gets looks and attention everywhere it goes. This takes some getting use to.  No regrets I\\'ve had this car nearly a year, and it earns all the accolades it has received in the extensive press coverage. It has enough power for street use even if slightly underpowered. Although it handles nearly as good as anything out there at 10/10ths, most non-professionals could likely get closer to the limits without tragedy than in other high- performance cars. Although it is borderline in power for an exotic, it\\'s appeal is definitely in the exotic category.  It is also incredibly comfortable, and I\\'ve had no problem issues in 11,000 miles. Versus its class, it has tremendous fuel economy.  As good as expected or better The car is incredible. It is so comfortable and practical (for what it is) that it could easily be a daily driver. Everywhere it goes it gets the looks and gawks of admirers while also the challneges and revs of the wannabes. Love the car...can\\'t think of another under 400k I\\'d rather have. The Incredible R8 Audi got this car right!  The fact that this car is mentioned in the same breath as a Porsche 911 Turbo and other high end sports cars says a lot about a car that didn\\'t exist 2 years ago.  The R8 drives like it is on rails and sticks like paint.  Be prepared to be stared at in the R8 and watch as little kids point at it.  The engine sounds awesome. I have considered many sports cars but $ for $ there is no better one out there.  Probably why there is a 2 year wait for it.  Do whatever you can and get one From a twin turbo convertible Picked up my R8 this week after having deposit down for a year. I traded in my \\'04 911 turbo convertible. While I do miss the convertible, the Audi\\'s exclusivity and sense of driving is second to none. The build quality surpassed my expectations and the sound when driving the car is amazing. I let a friend drive it and when I heard the car coming down the road, it sounded like a hurricane blowing in. Amazing. Everywhere one goes it captures a crowd and the looks of this car make it the best looking car on the road in my opinion. I have always been a Porsche guy, but am thrilled. Audi R8 ... awesome This car has it all. Striking styling, elegant interior, craftsman-quality of build and mind-blowing performance and handling.  After 2000 miles I am only beginning to explore the limits of this vehicle which, despite its breathtaking performance, is comfortable and driveable as an every day car.  The after sales care from Audi USA and my dealership have far exceeded my expectations.  It attracts unbelievable attention everywhere I go.   Audi R8 This is one amazing piece of craftsmanship. Audi has really stepped up their game far beyond what they have ever been. The only downfall is everything is a option. It made it so much more pricey. I know it\\'s money well spent, but it\\'s like Ferrari, everything is an option. The sound system, bluetooth connection, navigation system and the convenience package are all worth paying for. The performance from this vehicle is such a dream. It changes direction so effectively. The braking is okay, a little touchy, but it stops the car in short distances. It\\'s a manufactured perfection basically.  Audi, unexpected elegence. This car is a dream come true. Everything about it is stylish and classy with a sort of dirty elegence. When I first sat in the drivers seat of this beauty and felt the leather I knew that this was beyond ordinary. With its superior handling and stream-lined body style this is truly a car to be appreciated. Long Term Believer OH for the love of a car!! The Audi R8 1st Generation is truly \"ART ON WHEELS\"!!  Audi\\'s First Gen R8 will be a history maker well into it\\'s 3rd and 4th Generations.  Much has been said about the 1st Gen Tiptonic  Automatic Transmission but after 13,000+ miles I would buy this Supercar all over again. Absolutely no transmission problems with regular maintenance and care. It\\'s the Best Daily Driver Sports Car on the market even 7 years later. I plan to own this car indefinitely as it will most surely be a sought after Investment Grade Classic Car in 20 years time.  This 1st Gen R8 will be known for putting Audi back into the luxury market of quality built cars.  The versatility of the vehicle on the track as well as touring to the local wineries makes this vehicle a very fun vehicle to own. Not to mention the looks and attention you get when driving it. The car is also easily adoptable to making the V8 into a howling muscle car or with many after market add-ons a show piece worthy of any high end car show. From a practicality view it most definitely blows the doors off any Lambo and is much less common than any Porsche. The corvettes of 2009 don\\'t even compare to the drivability and road hugging capability of this unique car. Anyway you look at it the 1st Gen R8 will take your breath away and if not careful take you up to an easy 90mph before you see the rotating red lights of your local\\'s finest coming up behind you. Coupe or convertible you can\\'t go wrong with owning an R8. A Jewel of a Car Silver/Carbon Blade/Black interior, every option offered. The R8 is designed, engineered, and built beautifully. The engine is very smooth and revs like a 4-cylinder with the power of a V-8. Handling is great with mid-engine & low polar moment. The car is so confidence-inspiring that you want to go 10/10th\\'s through every curve and turn. V-10 power might be welcomed but the car is very well- balanced and quick with the V-8. You do need to keep the revs up past 4000 to extract max power & fun. The seats are the best I\\'ve felt in an exotic, as comfortable as my A8L. Lots of comfort for two but not much space for things. Footwell space is also minimal, especially on the passenger side. What a great car! The Audi R8 is the best car I have ever owned.  Its styling turns heads at every intersection.  Its performance puts it in the Supercar category.  Audi treats its R8 customers like royalty. It is a car that has luxurious interior.  The fit and finish is impeccable. It is a wonderful daily driver and it can go from the street to the track with no changes needed.  The R-Tronic transmission in auto mode is terrible.  The R-Tronic transmission in manual mode using the paddle shifters is the best transmission I have ever driven.  As a daily driver it gets ~19 mpg.  On the track...it does not matter.  Nothing passed it on my one track day.  This is a car to own. MY R8 2009 Audi R8 silver/black interiors with carbon sideblades. After a year of wait I received my fully loaded R8 almost for Christmas. I chose manual transmission as it is a real sports car. The car works flawlessly, it is beautiful and attracts a lot of attention, the driving experience is unparalleled. I use it as my daily driver, I plan to put 10,000 miles per year to it; you get used to the task of driving it in the city traffic and the constant looks and comments from almost everyone. The engine roars with menace after 4,000 rpm, the sound is breathtaking. Today, I would not choose any other car over this one, maybe in 3 years when the roadster is available. The Best Of The Best Audi has really outdone themselves.! My wife and I are Audi lovers having first experienced the Q7. I must say it has more dependability than my BMW 645i. This car for it\\'s first stab at luxury and performance has done admirably well.  It\\'s a joy to drive at all speeds.I drove both transmissions and chose the R-Tronic. It is touchy at slow speeds but you have a shifter plus paddles plus a sport position. All make it versatile and worth a one year wait.  I find it\\'s virtually impossible to pull into a gas station for a quick fillup without engaging in a long discussion of it\\'s merits. Gotta love it !!! Just a terrific car! After all the waiting I finally have my 09 R8. It exceeds all my expectations. It sounds right, handles fabulous and turns heads everywhere it goes. My only initial misgiving was the R-Tronic which had be given mixed reviews. Having driven boththe 6 speed and now my R-Tronic I can say that it comes down to personal preference. I actually enjoy processing the R-Tronic and find it very capable of satisfying me. No regrets here from this owner. Love the roomy interior, fantastic seats, and look and finish of the carbon fibre trim inside and out ( Blades too! ) Have friends with Italian exotics and would not trade this for any of them. This car is really special and my favorite of all! One month review Traded in older 911 4S for this. The R8 is a lovely car - the manual is buttery smooth and handling is good. Interior quality and design is excellent.  The V8 is strong but not supercar fast. Downsides are limited storage (as expected), older MMI, no Bluetooth music, USB to phone dongle is poorly designed (it\\'s too short and requires an extension cord for your phone). Finally the S Tronic This is the 4th R8 I have owned & it is by far the best . Dumped my 012 V10 R-Tronicblack optic edition for a 2014 V8 w/ S -Tronic . I love this car , smooth , powerful & sounds great . Comfortable for longer drives it is like they say.. an every day sports car .Gets a lot of attention when I park it , people love the car .  Love my R8 I bought it used, and feel I definitely got a good bang for the buck. It\\'s a gorgeous car that turns heads, even though I couldn\\'t care less about that. It\\'s of course a super car, and the performance, handling and braking are fantastic. What\\'s different is that in the regular settings, this car is far more driveable than many high performance cars. It\\'s very comfortable, and could easily be a daily driver, whereas many of the others in this category beat your kidneys and back up. I love the car and plan on keeping it for many years. I\\'ve had almost zero mechanical issues in two years, and just really enjoy it. So close to perfect . . . I took delivery of my first R8 in Jan 2008 and of my second (V10) in July 2010.Both are amazing machines, giving an average driver such as me a sense of control over the car and safety in aggressive driving that I have never experienced in other cars.If you want to beat every car you\\'ll ever meet at a stoplight off the line, this is the not the car for you.Several Porsches, a few V12 Italians, and even one Cadillac and one Corvette can do it, even with the V10.But none do it with this combination of speed, control, safety, looks and noise -- undoubtably the best-executed set of inevitable design tradeoffs automotive engineers have ever pulled off. R8 4.2  I shopped the R8 v the Porsche GT3 and while hardcore fans will think i made the wrong choice, the GT3 was jst too extreme to be enjoyed otherwise than the track.The R8 is so enjoyable as a daily drive that trns heads.Let\\'s be honest, nobody gives a darn abot a porsche.One drawback to the porsches classical styling and the sbtle changes over the last 50 years is that nobody cares.The R8?Snaps necks everywhere yo go.This car is so mch more beatifl in person and it backs that up with amazing performance.I considered the V10 bt becase of the car press\\' comments that the 4.2 is nderpowered...it is not.Perfectly balanced car Fun S7 Great all around car....sporty but very flexible....can haul...people or lots of stuff . I have a 2016 A7 and just wanted to try the S7. My biggest complaint is on all cars now ....the auto turn off when you are stopped...You can cancel this feature but the car defaults to it every time you shut the car off. New S7 Had A7 for 2 years, excellent car! Bought a 2017 S7 loaded. WOW! Amazing vehicle...   Worth every penny. Stealth Performer This is a beautiful looking and performing 4 door sedan. Acceleration is effortless especially with the twin clutch transmission.  The S  version is the way to go with every Audi model. S7 sport package option is a must to maximize performance and black optics package provides a more aggressive look. S7 Heaven I have had my S7 for two weeks now and it is an amazing vehicle.I just got rid of my Porsche 911 as I decided I needed a little more refinement with my driving experience.The S7 is explosively powerful, quiet, nimble and incredibly fun to drive.The blend of driving performance, technology and comfort is astonishing and I could not be happier in this car.I get more stares and more comments on my S7 than I ever did on my 911 and that is something a car nut like myself also appreciates ... people say \"I love your car\" and I say \"So do I, thanks!\" Luxury Sport Sedan As a driving/car enthusiast the S7 is the best of both worlds. Refined and luxurious interior, powerful turbine like engine. Automated manual tranmission can be driven as smoothly as an automatic, or as aggressively as any high performance manual trans would allow.Test drove Porche Panamera 4S. Same performance with better fuel economy and less costly maintenance and sticker price. Power and speed are deceiving due to flat torque curve almost throughout entire rpm range. Launch control is houligan\\'s delight. Got back into my wife\\'s MDX and thought the parking brake was on when accelerating. Smooth powerful brakes. Car drives like a smaller and lighter vehicle than what it is.  June 2016  Alas this sexy Lookong vehicle\\'s lease has expired.  3 years later not one defect.  20 inch rims are delicate and not strong enough for NJ winters.  Routine maintenace costs are 2-3 Times more expensive than similar Asian vehicles.  Car is very roomy with hatch adding utility.  Engine is detuned so as not to compete with S8 it RS7 even though mechanically similar. Some engineering oversights such as rear seats cannot be locked , radio goes on Automatically every time you start the car, hatch cannot be closed with remote, Windows and sunroof cannot be opened with key fob on hot days. The S7 is a Sexy High Performance Machine I love this car! Smooth, smooth and smooth. Fast, smart tech, quiet, and great gas mileage for a 4.0 twin turbo.  0-60 in 3.9. The European delivery was excellent! A couple of small things I would recommend to Audi: 1. Clockwise should be zoom in on the nav, not zoom out.  It\\'s counterintuitive. 2. After I hit the start/stop button to turn off the engine, the home link won\\'t activate the garage door. 3. No S7 rubber door mats, just with A7 logo.  Getting in/out of the rear seats is fine, for some reason other reviews think this is cramped and it really isn\\'t.  I\\'ve had it for two years and still love it. Daily Commuter with Benefits Absolutely love this car. Has been performing well as a daily commuter, but has the power and performance when I have a chance to push it. YEEEESSSSSS-7! Absolutely love the fit & finish of this car!  The silver leather quilted interior is excellent, and I get a lot of compliments on it. But the best thing is the acceleration and handling. It has all that, and more!  Fabulously smooth turbos will put you back into your seat. The only downside is the cost of maintenance-$1900 for the 35k service? Really?!?  For essentially a tune up and filter replacement?  That, and the fact that after three years, and only 15,000 additional miles, the car I paid $65k for from the dealer\\'s wife is only worth half of that.  I truly expected it to hold its value better.   But I do love the car. 40,000 mile review This is my 4 th Audi since 2007. The S7 is fantastic. It\\'s cramped in the back. And it\\'s not as comfortable or as quiet as my A8. It gets around 18 mpg. But beyond that, it\\'s fantastic. It has all of the great techno-baubles Audi has been delivering for several years now. Fortunately, mine does not have the bioptic adaptive cruise feature. I spent a day driving a new A8 loaner with it and didn\\'t like it. The S7 also does not have the Eco engine cutoff feature that the other A7 models have. I find that feature distracting. The S7 is very quick and while not as capable on snow as my old 8 it seems sure footed on wet streets. It did occasionally hydroplane on deeper water because of its wide tires but I changed the tires to a more wet friendly tread and haven\\'t noticed that problem. The 7 has been a great car with only one problem so far. The air suspension was making a noise when the car was cold. But that was last year. We\\'ll see if it picks up again this winter. It\\'s a very impressive, well optioned car at the price point.  I keep trying to justify buying another M or an AMG and I\\'m always astounded at how much more expensive they are than Audis. I have since bought another Audi Q7. A testament to their overall value and dependability. S7 Engine Malfunction Fault Engine Malfunction Light came on after 60km. 4 months later and 8350km and 3 more times of the fault light coming on Audi can only say that it is a set ofcircumstances in the fuel system that causes low pressure and the engine malfunction light to come on. Audi has changed the pressure switch and the fuel pump numerous times now but with NO success.Has anyone else had this problem?Very discouraged with reliability and Audi not being able to isolate problem and fix it.  A car with self-confidence Imagine spending 70k for a car and being glad you did.   For the money, I think you would be hard pressed to beat the quality, functionality, and performance of this vehicle.   The exterior is modest but handsome and understates what lies within.  Most non-car people don\\'t have any idea what this car is about.  For me, that is appealing.   I read all the reviews and most were spot on.  The only downside is having to constantly watch your speed (although there is an alarm for that), as the car demands to be driven fast.    Running errands is no longer a chore.  If you are considering this vehicle and need something luxurious, practical,  and a thrill to drive, buy it as the possibility of buyer\\'s remorse is non-existent.  This car won\\'t let you down. Quick, sporty, and comfortable. Style is subdued, turbo V-8 is nice, smooth comfortable ride when taking it easy, and fun driving when you gun it in Sport mode. All I can say is WOOOOOW! My first Audi, and definitely not my last!  Similar to anyone else looking at this beast of a car, I checked at BMW and MB.  Although all 3 were great in their own right, I REALLY liked how Audi brought the fun to drive aspect of the BMW together with the luxury of the Benz.  It\\'s not as flashy as either one of its competitors, but that\\'s something I like.  It\\'s understated elegance is perfect for me and anyone else who wants to drive an amazing car that doesn\\'t say \"I\\'m trying to keep up with the Joneses\".  Car enthusiast know what you\\'re driving but the average person just thinks you got a clean, elegant looking and nice sounding sedan.  Some of my favorite features are the massaging seats (many variations of messaging available), 14 speaker - 630 watt Bose sound system, infotainment system (once you figure it out), options on ambient lighting, Google maps (the best!), Apple Car Play, USB connections (finally), clean exterior lines, gorgeous interior styling, acceleration (off the charts), and finally driving and handling ability!  If I had to give a gripe (and I have a couple), the gas mileage can be really bad if you\\'re not careful and the noise level on highway speeds is higher than I would have liked (It\\'s about the same as the others in it\\'s segment, I\\'m just used to an SUV and it seemed quite because your higher off the road....I guess).  Keep up the good work Audi, you knocked this one out of the park! Grown up car It is true this car doesn\\'t handle as well as other in it\\'s class and price range. With that said, 99% of most drivers (me included) don\\'t drive on the track and don\\'t reach the limits of this car or any other in it\\'s class. And then you enjoy the comforts of a grown up car, while having ample power and fun. For me, I couldn\\'t think of another car to own. 2017 S6 - super fun to drive! 2017 S6 Prestige Mythos black,  Cold weather, handling package, driver assistance, black optic pkg.    I shopped around at BMW (550xi), Maserati (Ghibli), Mercedes (E400), and Jaguar before making my decision on the 2017 Audi S6.   In comparison no other car felt as athletic, well grounded, and luxurious all in the same package as the S6.  The S6 is awesome, by far the most enjoyable Audi i have ever drove or owned.  I am looking for reasons to take it out (grocery store, pick up fast food, run errands, etc).  The engine gives you massive hp and torque at low rpms, and the exhaust note is intoxicating, but is not overstated.  The S6 has plenty of room for both front and rear passengers, and has lots of tech upgrades such as bose audio system, apple car play, google based navigation, and tons of safety features.  With configurable settings for ride height, transmission, and suspension the car can go from stiff and sporty, to comfort and luxurious for longer drives.  I love this car! Great car, horrendous repairs and maintenance I purchased this car with approximately 40,000 miles on it and by 60,000 it needed over $4,000 dollars in repairs. At 50,000 miles the \"check coolant\" message appeared every day until a visit to the dealer revealed that a new water pump was needed at around $2,000 with labor. Not 5,000 miles later the engine developed a high pitch squeal at idle. The remedy for that was a costly repair to the high pressure oil system.  Throughout the ownership of the car a clunking noise could be heard from the passenger footwell over every bump. This was never actually solved but was believed to be the front drive shaft and was replaced. Granted the dealership sympathized with me over the problems I was having and had Audi cover the cost. The adaptive cruise control went out of calibration several times and disabled the cruise until a $400 calibration was completed. Besides from the mechanical issues several interior rattles showed up in quick succession. Maintenance costs were as expected for oil changes but in order to perform the 75,000 mile service the entire front end would have had to be disassembled adding up to a $2,000 plus charge. All that aside the car itself was fantastic. The engine sounded rich and the acceleration was insane. The interior looked premium and the quilted seats were gorgeous. The exterior of the car had just the right blend of sport and luxury. All in all the dealer was exceptional and I would recommend the car if you don\\'t mind the high maintenance and repair costs. 2013 Audi S6 is a bargain I traded my 2011 Audi S4 Prestige with drive Select on a 2013 S6 with the invovation package. Although the S6 was 30% more expensive than the S4, I consider it a bargain. It rides better, handles better, is faster, and is techincally much more advanced than the S4. It also gets just as good gas mileage. I have been driving Audi Quattros since 1987 and This is my eleventh one, so I do have considerable experience with the brand and know what I am saying when I say the 2013 Audi S6 is one awesome car.  Awesome machine Traded a 09 C4S for this. We wanted something we could drive everyday in Chicago and still be fun. The V10 is just awesome. Love the sound. Put the car in S mode and hold on. Drove the Panamera before purchased, I just can\\'t get past the ugly exterior.  My S6 review This car has been fantastic over the past 2 years!  The only faults are that it is  heavy car, and isn\\'t as nimble as my 3 series BMW. However, the front seats are amazingly comfortable, the interior is top notch, and the power and torque are monstrous but precise...fantastic engine growl and acceleration.  No denying that a V10 is truly addictive. Gas mileage in non-sport mode is quite good...around low 20\\'s mpg.  The only issues I had have been electrical...automatic headlights didn\\'t function correctly after a few months and had to be completely replaced (under warranty).  Also, I have gone through several sets of tires prematurely...you have to keep an eye out for uneven wear due to weight. Dissapointed Car drove and performed well. Service and reliability were a nightmare. At one point I was told they needed to remove my engine to replace a sensor. Many occasions where my car was never even looked at or serviced after having been left all day.  Bottom line had to get rid of the car because of sevice and reliability will never buy an Audi again S6 is the bomb! Simply an awesome vehicle.  The V10 engine is unlike any other and the overall balance of the vehicle at high and low speeds is perfect. Interior features such as bluetooth, iPod integration, speech recognition are easy to learn and enjoyable. Interior comfort is superb and four people fit comfortably.  A car that makes you want to drive more. Love my S6 Compared to Jag, BMW M5, MB E63, Audi seemed to have the best value for performance and interior quality. Ride a little firmer than my CTS-V, but it\\'s not punishing. MPG average on the city/highway was 19, not bad for such a large car. Trunk is huge, seats are wonderful. The nav, radio, satellite, bluetooth phone controls are easy to learn. It is as fast as my CTS-V was, but much more sophisticated. Don\\'t see any S6s on the road, which is nice. Haven\\'t found any negatives yet. Good choice if you\\'re looking for a quick, comfortable, roomy four door sedan. And it was a lot less $ than the benz and bimmer. FANTASTICO!! I just puchased this amazing car and let me tell you, it\\'s everything that I ever thought it would be, only much much more. The design is perfect starting from the body right down to the beautiful interior with soft Italian napa leather seats and a console that lights up like a 747 jet cockpit at night. Being from Italy though, I will tell you that the most impressive thing about this amazing machine is the roar and power of its V-10 Lamborghini Gallardo engine,and the handling that this car has in the curves. This is proably the best money that I have ever spent. I still can\\'t beleive that my wife let me buy it! (She loves it too.) And so will you !! S6 Rules I smile as the starter whirrs and the engine lights up!  This is a REAL sports sedan. Drives totally different from my 2006 A6: engine, suspension, steering, brakes, handling.  Worth each dollar! Best Top Secret in the Market Audi A6 S6 will exceed your expectation.  This is a car for the \"connoisseur\".  The only way to appreciate the A6 S6 is take a test drive.  Once you sit behind the wheel, you will see what I am talking about.  This is a luxury car inside out and the V10 will let you know that you have a rocket in your hands.  Attach your seat belts and enjoy the ride....   Most impressive vehicle I have driven Purchased the S6 in Nov and soon found out I had much more car on my hands than I had expected.  Finesse doesn\\'t describe this car\\'s ability to accelerate, brake, manuever or perform.  Handles everything with ease. The best part is that aside from the 19\" wheels and the dimuitive V10 and S6 badges, this vehicle looks like a nice A6.  Pass someone and their eyes and ears are opened by the rumbling of the 5.2 liter powerplant.  This is a rocketship! Sport vs comfort Overall very good car with excellent drive train, decent fuel economy, good handling for big car, and thus far above average reliability. Very good MMI information system.  Downside, sport seats are hard, so consider buying with comfort seat.  20 inch wheels looks great but ride and noise level are affected so go with 19 inch wheels. Great car to drive, fiddly electronics I have leased the 2016 S6 and just passed the 15K mile threshold.  The car performs largely as advertised.  Accelleration is steady and very powerful, continues to build way past any speed at which I am comfortable to drive (and way past any highway speed limits). The dual clutch transmission is also smooth and fast, though driving with one takes a little getting used to, particularly when changing from reverse to drive or at low speeds. The sedan is also quite nimble for its size, and with the active suspension it has very little body roll. In particular, it is a pleasure to accelerate through and out of turns, let the torque vector push the car around the bends.  The interior is very quiet and comfortable, and the comfort seat package IMHO is great (I think ventilated seats are a must in a warm climate). My only gripe is that the touchpad system is terrible. Audi uses it for radio presets, and it will often mistake a touch for an attempt at setting a new preset, causing you to have to go back and re-input your intended stations. I just don\\'t use it at all for anything but navigation entry (the handwriting recognition is good). The audio quality is solid (I didn\\'t choose the top-level system, just the upgraded sound).  Fuel economy is about what you\\'d expect for a car of this type, and I average about 22mpg in mixed driving. Overall, if you want a beautiful, understated but very fast, very luxurious sedan, this is a great choice, and I\\'d get it again. Power Awesome car. Absolutely Fantastic This car is worth every dollar... and you will pay for the privilege.  Extremely comfortable, fast, quiet inside, great exhaust note on the outside.  Fully adjustable steering, transmission, engine response, exhaust volume, wonderful stereo.  This thing is built like a tank, but dances like a ballerina.  The unaware would be very unwise to challenge you at the stoplight.  Update - Even more impressed on long road trips and handling in the snow, including almost 30mpg at 70mph.  Continues to be supremely fast, comfortable and capable. 2016 Audi s6 I custom ordered the car.it took 63 days,it\\'s my first Audi and I am loving it.traded in my 2012 Acura TL 6 speed manual,all wheel drive,tech package.very happy with the dealership,Coral Springs Audi.tried to order the car from braman but they wouldn\\'t do it and they wouldn\\'t give me the price I wanted.the Audi s6 has the bang and Olufsen music system,sport package,black optic package,black wood and aluminum trim,rear side airbags,black cloth headliner,all weather rubber floor mats front and rear,trunk cargo liner,wheel locks,cargo box,prestige trim.florret silver,black interior.,cargo net.i have had the car 6 months and I can\\'t believe how great this car drives.the power on demand the luxury how this car rides if you have the means buy this car it is so much fun to drive.its now been one year that I bought this car.its the best car I have ever owned.only 2 negatives I have about the car.one is I am only able to rip77 cd to the hard drive.the car only has 10 giga bytes for cd.the other negative is the indivual tire psi is not displayed.thats it for the negative.i love this car if you are able buy one before they do away with the v8 engine.its the best sleeper muscle car.no problems at all with the car.i had my 5000 mile service and 3000 miles later I had to add three quarters of a quart of oil.thats it the car has been a dream to own and drive.edmunds ask me to update my review.well I have 14500 miles on the car and I am still in love with this car.i have to add half a quart of oil every 2200 miles approximately.i drove this car from West Palm Beach to Alpharetta ga.

Traded in a 2015 Carrera 4 GTS for 2016 S6 After one day I am greatly enjoying the car.  Understated and powerful, luxurious and sporty, it\\'s a perfect fit for my lifestyle. S6 purchased 1/14/16 It was tough getting my hands on one of theses guys. I didn\\'t even see one to test drive before i picked mine up. When i finally did I had absolutely none of the buyers remorse that often come with forking over 80+K for a car. From the way the car starts and revs when you press the classy res start button, to the diamond leather stitching inside the car is a true gem. The controls , especially for media and music have a learning cuvre, but the touchpad and nav are truly top class. I opted for the black optic package and 20 inch wheels which give the car a bit of an edge not seen on the basic model,  and I recommend payimg for the extended 10 yr warrant as I can only image what this puppy will cost later on t o fix, but this being my 3rd audi, I know I wont have much to worry about until year 10 and beyond. The car is a dream to drive, and I love flexing its muscle to the unsuspecting speed racer nob heads you often encounter on the road. Car came with summer tires so i immediately got the snow tire package and am actually begging for snow. The car has tremendous grip on snow , as most audi\\'s with quattro do. Basically I love my new car, and inncidentlly it looks better then the slightly more expensive s7 in my opinion. My new 4 door sports car I\\'ve happily owned my S6 now for 19 months. Still see very few on the road. I\\'m often asked if this is a REAL S6..I\\'m happy to say yes..I\\'ve just gone over 14,000 miles with ZERO problems or complaints. The seats are amazing.... In fact the whole car is amazing.... The B & O sound system is the only way to go.. I plan on keeping this sleeping beast for quite a while.. Ultimate Daily Driver I got this car because i am tired of SUV\\'s slowness and bad handling. but i do need the utility part. 340hp make ur right foot feels good all the time, and the car\\'s look will never get u the bad attention from cops.very well build, every little details that shows great craftmanship. enjoy drive it everyday, every where. and the good part is it does not bother me with TPMS, non-seat belt warning those extra annoying features. Well, Bad thing about this car is expensive to fix, timing belt cost more than $2500. Also all the audi/vw\\'s cockpit control button\\'s letter ez to wear off, make the car looks older. try to upgrade but audi do not offer V8 wagon no more, and Q7 just not as sharp! Elegant Mule I\\'m an Audi Collector. Which is why I bought this car. They are relatively rare for the US market. It\\'s a powerful beast and holds the road. It snugs right into the fold of the B5 S4 & D2 S8. Although I have to say~ although similarly outfitted, the S8 holds its weight better than the S6, thus, it is faster around almost any track under various conditions. The offset to this is cargo space. The S6 has its place and I love it. Excellent Car!!! The car has great power and stability.  Quattro handling is excellent in snow.  The flexibility of the transmission from full auto, sport auto to pseudo manual with paddle shifters is great.  I never think twice about power to maneuver.  I look forward to driving the car every time.  Also, the lower/wider stance keeps the car firmly gripping the road and gives it a great look.  It is the perfect blend between utility and sport. This car is wonderful. Recently purchased this car Audi CPO.  Drove it 1000 mi home - It was like a vacation.  This car is perfect. Everything from the dashboard lights to the advanced braking system work in perfect harmony.  Some notes: leather seats without alcantara insets are simply TOO slippery for spirited driving.  I spent a lot of my trip home planted to the door because I slipped out of my seat.  (Learned to offset that a little by stomping on the dead pedal.) Probably wouldn\\'t be an issue for a wider person.  Yes, you get terrible mileage.  It IS worth it.  If you\\'re doing mostly highway miles (like me), you\\'re getting about 18 mpg, which isn\\'t horrible.  City?  Hopefully you don\\'t drive very many miles :) Audi S6  will spoil you for ever. Sorry! bought the beautiful wagon for my \\rwife\\'s birthday after 6 volvos.J ust \\rbought a 2nd S6 because its \\rcomfortable, classy, very fast, fun \\rlike Nascar, and now i can drive my \\rown. just plane sweet meat; a treat \\rfor the feet and you won\\'t get beat in \\rthe real racing seat. \"Best car I have \\rever had\" says the little woman. Very \\rReliable. Absolutely blow your kids \\rhair and minds when you press the \\rpeddle on the way to school... but the \\rcops think you\\'re a little, albeit, \\rcute wagon! Ha! Yeah, right! 340hp \\rmama at 07:30 am don\\'t need no \\rstarbucks to get a buzz.  Great family car with spunk. We\\'ve owned the car for over a year, \\rand we enjoy driving it very much. \\rIt\\'s powerful, but also practical. \\rIt\\'s great in snow, too, provided you \\rget yourself some winter tires. The do it all super car I have been searching for five years \\rto find the ultimate combination of \\rperformance, practicality, luxury, and \\runderstated styling. This car has and \\rdoes it all.  While the RS6 beets this \\rhands down, this car has more than \\renough oomph and rail-like handling to \\rmake me smile from ear to ear.  \\rBeside, have you tried stuffing a few \\rkids and a few dogs with associated \\rgear into your uber-sedan for a treck \\racroos the country?  Also, exactly \\rwhere do you live that the roads and \\rthe cops will let you test the limits \\rof your double turbo Porsche? Audi doesn\\'t get it yet The car is really fun to drive, but \\rthe front seats are not the Recaros \\rwith the adjustable thigh bolster that \\rthe manual shows and there is very \\rlittle thigh support.\\r The real problem is Audi dealers.  \\rThey never tell the whole truth when \\ryou buy the car - every deal is a one-\\rshot relationship.  \\r Until Audi gets its dealers to act \\rlike human beings, buying and owning \\ran Audi will be a constant source of \\rirritation and frustration.  \\r Is it worth it?  With all the \\rcompeting products on the market, I \\rdoubt it.  Audi dealers are the worst \\rI have ever encountered.\\r Extraordinary I drive this car in extreme conditions, \\rand on uninhabited secondary roads,and \\rhighways, it\\'s performance is \\rspectacular. This car has been through \\rdeep snow and ice conditions with \\ramazing stability and confidence. There \\rare still a few places out west where \\ryou can push a cars limits , this car \\rhas seen speeds of \\r164mph! It remained as stable and quiet \\ras it was at 80.My dealership is as \\rgreat as the car \\ritself,reliable,courteous,efficient .  \\rThey know how to treat someone who \\rloves cars and pays that much for one\\r(they are a value at $62,000). Audi \\rshould be as proud to have their \\rproducts sold there as they are of \\rselling them. The wagon that thinks it\\'s a sports car \"...does not display the power/style \\rdifferences over other models to \\rjustify the extra cost...\". Well let\\'s \\rsee, the only other real competitor is \\rthe Mercedez Benz E320 4Matic wagon, \\rwhich has 221hp compared with the \\rAudi\\'s 340.\\r In terms of style, I like them both. \\rFrom the front, I have always liked the \\rE-Class, but after that, it\\'s all Audi. \\rThe same goes for the interior, which \\ris top shelf.\\r Is it worth the money? As someone who \\rloves sports cars, but also has a \\rfamily to think about, this car does \\rboth, and brings a smile to my face \\rwhenever I drive it. So for me, it\\'s \\rworth every penny. Persistent Vibration Too bad that this great car has a  Hottest Wagon on Earth Thought my 2002 A6 4.2 was as good as \\rfamily cars get . . . then I bought an \\rS6.  It has the punch and handling edge \\rof my 1998 Corvette, with infinitely \\rbetter build quality and chassis \\rsolidity.  Only downside is car was \\rdelivered with warped rear rotors \\r(which might have been caused by the \\rdealer over-torquing the aftermarket \\rwheels I had him install).  But the \\rdealer replaced the rotors the same day \\rI picked up the car and discovered the \\rproblem.  LOVE this car! Awesome Car This car is awesome!  It looks great,\\rhandles like a dream, and has the best\\rinterior I have ever seen.  You have to\\rget this wagon.  It drives like a car,\\ryet hauls like a wagon!  There is no\\rbetter combo!  You hardly ever see one\\ron the road, which I think is a good\\rthing, yet it needs to have some more fame! S6 Great handling and speed for such a  Overrated and overpriced I have driven this car for 3000 miles\\rand I am totally disappointed. WHile\\rthere are many admirable features, it\\rdoes not display the power/style\\rdifferences over other models to justify\\rthe extra cost. I am already looking to\\rsell this vehicle. 2002 - Audi S6 Avant This vehicle has done all that I have \\rasked it to do and the list is long. I \\ruse the car for quick, quiet, and \\reffortless business travel over long \\rdistances (800 miles per day)with and \\rwithout cargo. \\r Living across the road from Killington, \\rthe S6 Avant proved its worth when \\routfitted with Nokian snow tires. It is \\runstoppable in snow, ice, rain, and mud \\r(all at once)!\\r As for performance, on the stock tires \\rat Lime Rock Park in Connecticut during \\ra BMWCCA event I was able to put up a \\r1:06 flat lap while carrying a student \\rin the passenger seat. \\r Overall, this is the best wagon to do \\reverything qucikly and quietly in high \\rstyle. Great car No longer made by Audi. What a shame! Awesome Audi 2 years into ownership of this car, and I have NO regrets.  I cannot say enough about the performance of the little V8, even at high altitude. (I bet this would be a beast at sea level.)  I have 2 young kids (6 and 3), a wife, a big dog, a little dog, and stuff to haul back and forth to grandma\\'s house 275 miles one way - this car handles it amazingly well!!!  It is perfect in every way. Family Values If you have children and passion for what you drive, this is the car for you. Those who cannot or will not work on your own vehicle, move along. Audi cars do require extra service attention, but the 2002 S6 Avant will reward you handsomely with luxury, performance, style, and comfort that no SUV or mini-van can or will. You gotta pay to play! A sports car with lots of room!  I talked the wife into getting it because of its inherent virtues of safety, stability, reliability, versatility, and luxury.  I just wanted something fun to drive that would fit a family.  You won\\'t win many off the line against some of today\\'s high performance vehicles, but the power delivery seems endless once you get past 60.  I might as well pay in advance for speeding tickets.   Maintenance/gas ain\\'t cheap! 8 quarts of synthetic oil/$40 filter 20+gal of premium (I get 19-20 combined MPG, when I\\'m easy on it). Big vented brakes = big $$. Trust me - it is all worth the experience!   So far it has proven to be very solid and reliable. 2002 Audi S6 Avant This drives like a Porsche, but hauls Christmas trees, and all sorts of gear.  Sexier than any minivan or SUV, but not noticed by speed cops.  Great ski vehicle.   S6 Avant  eye opener The biggest \\'sleeper\\' on the road.  no one knows what they are dealing with until after the S6 taillights disappear from view.  Take this wagon seriously. Just Awesome Picked up my S6 as a CPO car after lusting after one for years.  I previously owned a 2000 A6 sedan, and the S6 is everything I wish that car had been.  This is simply the best wagon ever: gorgeous, fast, luxurious, and incredibly useful.  The fuel mileage is abysmal, but I was fully awared of that going in, so it\\'s not really a negative point for me. The Best This is the best car we have ever  S6Avant I have owned a number of Audi\\'s over  exciting solidness Astounding performance, excellent build \\rquality. Combines the best aspects of a \\rperformance car with a feeling of \\rluxury and comfort. This car has been \\rcompletely reliable and a constant joy \\rto drive, all in a wagon package that \\radds unexpected utility for a family \\rcar. Start of a Beautiful Relationship I got the S6 just last month and I love \\rit!  It handles well, is responsive, \\rand speedy (does as I ask it to, when I \\rneed it - especially in \"sport\" mode).  \\rIt\\'s the true \"mid-life crisis \\rcompromise\".  The front end belongs to \\rme and the back end belongs to the kids \\rand the dogs.  Great utility and fun!  \\rI hope it remains reliable in the \\rfuture. Far beyond emagination Probably one of the most reliable cars  Disappointed What a shame; a great concept spoiled  Under the radar high performance Audi S6 Audi\\'s \"Never follow\" ad campain \\rencapsulates the S6 perfectly in all \\raspects. The only way to discribe this \\rcar is :\"it\\'s stiff,responsive, focused \\r& fast\".                         \\rThe car is a decathlete in a grey \\rflannel suit; pubesent racers will have \\rto look elsewhere for presumptuous \\rwings and other mutant aero appendages.\\rWith 36.4 cubic feet of luggage space \\rand roomy interior for four adults, the \\rS6 is unmatched in it\\'s versatilaty and \\rluxurious comfort. All in all this \\rrocket lux wagon has an equal level of \\rsports performance that will rival any \\rBMW M or AMG sports sedan.              \\rThanks to Len Hunt ,for giving Audi new \\rDNA . Nothing but Audi This is my second try for Audi after \\rAudi 80. And I would say nothing \\rbetter than this car has ever been \\rmade, even stupid-bulky Mercedes \\rcouldn\\'t be even close by to this \\rvehicle, I have a friend of mine who \\rownes S500, he really envy me. :))) \\ralthough my Audi slightly smaller than \\rhis potato carrier. A Real SUV Probably the ultimate compromise \\rbetween sport and utility -- as much \\rroom as an SUV, way more fun to \\rdrive, and any more performance \\rwould be too much for North \\rAmerica. Stealth Wagon I agree with the others here; this is a  It can only get better with an RS6 The only thing I crave more with this  Family image This car is truly awesome! It satisfies  Finest All-around Vehicle On the Planet Power is awesome, v aggressive esp in \\rsport mode with a perfect growl from \\rthe engine/exhaust. Tranny\\'s v.smooth, \\rlittle slow in normal mode, much \\rcrisper/quicker in sport mode. Very \\reasy to elicit desired downshifts.  \\rHandling: light and nimble, surprising \\rfor 4k lbs. Better than S4 Avant. \\rSuspension is very comfortable in \\reveryday driving. Flat and firm when \\rdriven with vigor. Virtually zero body \\rroll, pitch, or dive. Very accurate, \\rsltly overboosted low-speed steering, \\rperfect at high-speeds.  Interior: \\rflawless, Alcantara is very nice and \\rgrippy.  Typical perfect Audi. Exterior \\rstyle, especially in Amulet or Black is \\ramazing...very muscular... Ultimate Family Car I traded a 2000 S4 sedan which I loved \\rin order to gain more room for kids. \\rIt was a tough choice, but worked out \\rwell. I love having a torquey V8 again \\r(fond memories of youth) and it \\rhandles surprisingly well for big \\rwagon. I can haul the family around \\rand blow the doors almost all traffic \\rwhile doing it. Sticks like glue rain, \\rsnow, or shine and feels safe. In some \\rways it is better balanced than the S4 \\rsedan. Very good brakes (though not as \\rgood as S4). The interior is \\routstanding and my kids love the third \\rrow seat. The styling is still a work \\rof art and looks great from any angle. \\rOne of the best compromise vehicles \\rever made. The best handling wagon From the very first day these marvel \\rhas really make me be happy driving \\rallday , if you don´t believe please \\rjust go to a dealer and test it , then \\ryou will understand. Undercover rocket. This has been a fully satisfying vehicle. Since I picked it up, every time I drive it, I enjoy the experience.  I only have a 2 mile each way commute for work, yet I find myself looking for opportunities to \"go and get groceries\" or really any excuse to drive somewhere, anywhere.  \\r A very firm yet comfortable car which generally doesn\\'t arouse the constables.  Those who know what the \"S\" badges front and rear mean are the ones who appreciate this fine automobile. Spectacular car, not cheap though. Don\\'t kid yourself, this car gets expensive fast, expect no more than 17mpg unless you do a ton of highway miles. Cheap repairs are 2k+ a set of tires is easily 1800. It really should be babied to keep up appearance and performance, plan for 400+/mo. If none of that makes you cringe, then I highly recommend  it. It will keep pace with if not outright decimate most cars out there, and happily put domestic upstarts to shame, while looking so much classier doing so. It handles beautifully, even performs drifts well, especially for a heavy luxury sedan. Every day with this car is a treat, it makes every mile so much more fun than my 08 S4. The onboard tech is very impressive, and for someone with back problems, it\\'s extremely comfortable, even on very long drives (8+hrs).  If you\\'re considering this car and have the desire to spend the money on it that it deserves, just do it. Anyone who says the 3L turbo A6 is comparable is simply wrong. This is an entirely different beast. Who writes these reviews? I almost did not purchase this car after reading what Edmunds and alike had to say, but luckily did after driving both the E63 and M5. They are definitely fast but so is a ZR1 corvett or a mustang! Point being, Audi owners have more in mind than pure horsepower. It\\'s the ability to have a car that handles under all conditions and environments, and do it in a way that doesn\\'t say look at me. And seriously, the engine is a thing of beauty! The M5 will take me out until it starts to rain..he\\'ll be in the ditch and I\\'ll be eating dinner! I have seriously considered getting an R8 but can\\'t come to grips with giving up such an all around wonderful car.  Amazing This car is absolutely amazing.  The Led lights are stunning.  The white and red interior dashboard displays are amazing.  The sport seats are very comfortable and keep you strapped.  Everyone that sees this beautiful and yet understated beast knows that there is something very special underneath the hood.  I might as well replace the stock hood with a transparent hood to see that Lamborghini derived V10 beauty.   There is no comparison This is my 4th Audi and by far my favorite. You can\\'t compare this car to the M5 or the E63, That\\'s what the RS6 is for (We won\\'t get the current 570bhp in the states) For those of us that know about Audis, this car will blow away any E500 or twin Turbo 550i and you will look better doing it. This is the best S I have owned. I had the 2001 S8 and that was a blast too.Until the 2011 RS6 comes this is the next best thing or the 2003 RS6. Wow and simply amazing Purchased this car Friday and have not stopped admiring what this car is capable of and how much fun you can have in a sedan. Tested M3 M5 but for the price, refinement and handling, hands down this the car is the best. It\\'s a Lambo in a sedan\\'s clothing and the grunt the engine make when it\\'s pushed is awesome. Plus you have quattro stabilty and handling.  Classy-Performance Sleeper Saw the A6, then the S6 and there was no comparison. I had to have it. performs and handles so superb and with its understated elegance, fools others who cannot believe how much sportiness and luxury is poured into one car! Has better, more luxurious interior than the competitors, yet keeps it sporty. It\\'s a rocket limo I bought the S6 after owning 3 Porsche\\'s.  I shopped the E63 AMG, GS460, Jaguar XF and M5.  The S6 is the best combo of ammenities, price, performance and looks.  After driving it a while it\\'s better than I expected. Great Car I bought this car last month and seem to learn that it can do more, much more, than I\\'ll ever force it too.  Knowing it has the power and handling is great on I 5 and heading to Seattle on the weekends.   Excellent Car Love it, most fun to drive car I\\'ve ever owned of the 50+ exotics and luxury cars I\\'ve had so far.  Get it while you can! This is a very special car that will never exist in this form again since the Lambo/R8 V10 drivetrain will be replaced by a smaller, supercharged engine in the next iteration of the S6. And while it will no doubt outperform the current V10, it will be a much more generic experience. This car is simply a great overall value in this class all things considered (V10, AWD, Audi interior, loaded with options). And you probably will never see yourself coming or going on the road. If only... Before 3 of the 4 air suspension bags and air suspension pump failed..the car was fun to drive...there have been so many little things, coupled with the big things- I feel like after 30,000 miles my Audi was nickel and diming me to death...with the air suspension failure (apparently inevitable with this car) I\\'M DONE!....and I\\'m not alone, -google Audi forums- EVERYONE hates the KNOWN failures of this car. Wish I had stayed with my old reliable VOLVO.  Tempermental Performer Bought mine used with 35K. I\\'ve had a few problems from the suspension airbags to drive seals and electrical bugs. Car is now at 70K. It is a highly engineered car that is also intended as a \\'rugged\\' vehicle.  Maybe too much for the billing. It can be costly to keep but it does run hard, always looks good and is differentiated even from new cars.  It is feature rich and the fit-n-finish quality evident. Depending on driving patterns, off-road etc. the air suspension, brakes and cooling systems can be faulty. You do have the turbo lag and heavy transmission shifting that the manual tiptronic addresses.  The car is a beast in wet or snowy conditions and runs well in cold weather and desert. Beware! First, the good news.  This car is fun to drive and fits a great niche (like a Volvo XC70 or Outback).  Now the bad news.  Reliability.  Or should I say unreliability.  I purchased an allroad certified from the dealer with 30K miles on it.  Since then, the car has had probably 15 trips for repairs, totaling over $20,000.  Everything you can imagine.  The first few years, the dealer covered it.  But I\\'ve paid out about $10K personally now.  Audi needs to get its act together.  I hope they do, but this Audi is my last.   Audi Loyalist Purchased car used with 48,000 miles but with a six year 100K warranty.  Auto has proven to be the most versatile vehicle I have ever owned. Now that the car is getting up in mileage (82,000) I am getting concerned about ownership costs. I had both front air struts replaced at a cost of $2,700 (ouch)and have had two sets of front brake rotors warp and the air bag sensor needed to be replaced, all major items but my extended warranty covered everything except the shocks (coverage expired two weeks before shocks blew). Regardless I have greatly enjoyed the ownership experience and am actually scouring the market for a low mileage 2005 model as no other car on the market comes close. Learned some things Bought car used while still under Audi warranty.  110,000 miles on the car now, and no squeaks or rattles.  The car isn\\'t as reliable as older Audis I\\'ve owned, but more reliable than some cars.  Wears tires quickly (a trait of AWD cars) but fat, sticky rubber isn\\'t supposed to last.  It is a car that looks like it belongs in a most affluent customer\\'s driveway.  Positive comments from everyone from airport valet to Samoan tuner/racers to a Porsche racing equipment vendor.   It isn\\'t an economy car, but will comfortably run rings around \"sport\" SUVs while getting far better mileage than they will.  The Swiss Army knife of cars. Car from HELL! I purchased the Certified Allroad to replace my wife\\x92s 1999 Lexus RX300 that had zero problems in 90000 miles (65000 when bought).  My wife passed away from cancer and it was emotionally difficult for me to drive her car.  I thought the Audi would serve a dual purpose of SUV for camping and nice transportation for travel to my children who live several hours away in snowy regions.  I underestimated the enormous unreliability.  In 18000 miles, it\\x92s had problems with the suspension system (very pricey), the cooling system (shop for 10 days after very frightening breakdown), windshield wipers, transmission, electric windows, airbag system, trim falling off or breaking. Audi has been no help. Ultimate Snow Car I have lived in Colorado Ski Country for 47 years and have driven Jeeps, Landrovers, Ford Explorers, BMW\\'s and ugh, yes even a Mercedes. The Audi Allroad with Michelin snow tires is the finest handling snow car in the world! Really!! I drive from Denver to Leadville and to Aspen every week during the winter and navigate multiple 11,000 and 12,00 foot passes all winter; even during the height of three and four foot snowstorms. Trust me, this car has saved us from serious injury at least twice. However, as I approach 90,000 miles, I\\'m getting very nervous that my 100,000 warrantly is nearing its end.Only serious problem has been the hydraulics. They\\'ve been replaced three times on warranty.  Be warned - this car could bankrupt you We bought this car as an SUV alternative - loved the carlike driving, decent performance and Audi style.  Unfortunately, the car has been dreadfully unreliable.  We\\'ve lost $20,000 in depreciation in 30,000 miles and had over $20,000 of warantee repair work done - thats $40,000 to drive 30,000 miles!! WOW.  The list of repairs (covered by Audi but inconvenient to say the least) is too long to fit here: 2 replacement transmissions; new brake rotors every 15,000; new front air suspension at 58,000; front tie rods at 55,000; 2 air flow sensors; 3 hazzard light switches; new radiator at 52,000 miles; steering angle sensor (controls ABS)  No racing-no accidents-no excuse for this experience Great automobile but....... Incredible automobile - styling, design, drivability, etc. Works well for Maine winters. Minor problems along the way BUT no sooner than the 50k/4 yr warranty was over the whole transmission blew! Cost: $5,600 to replace. Audi \\'split\\' the cost and paid 75% while I paid $1,300. Bummer as the lease is almost over and had to fork over some large $$. I got nowhere with AudiUSA on this issue. No good explanation from anyone on the cause of the issue other than \\'it occasionally happens\\'. This is my 2nd Audi - first was a 1998 A6 which I purchased. Decided to lease this one. I\\'m afraid after 2 tries I\\'ll not purchase another Audi again.  I fear the undependability and future costs to maintain it. What a ride! I\\'ve had this car for about 3 1/2 \\ryears now, and it\\'s been great- the \\rbest car I\\'ve ever owned.  Twin turbo \\rengine mated to AWD and a variable \\rsuspension lead to a car both fast \\r(got my first ticket in 10 years in \\rthis car) AND utilitarian.  I still \\rget looks and the best comment I ever \\rheard was from a little kid who \\rpointed and said, \"Daddy, that\\'s a \\rcool-looking car!\"  Aside from usual \\rwear, there have been very few \\rproblems.  I\\'m switching out now, but \\ronly because I miss having a manual \\rtransmission (which is available for \\rthis car- what a mistake not getting \\rit!). The renaissance vehicle The allroad has been flawless. Great \\rhandling. Most impressive AWD system. \\rGets me from the coast to the coldest \\rand snowiest places faster than any \\rother vehicle - for the third year in \\ra row. After 40k miles, it\\'s proven \\ritself. Gas mileage has been 21.5mpg \\raverage for all my driving - and I \\rlove to accelerate! Beautiful Headache Redux I reviewed my car at 46k, now a follow-\\rup at 73k. The headaches are fewer, but \\rthe car didn\\'t shape up until after 50k \\rand MANY dealer visits. Audi put on \\rsame tires as A8 and balanced them \\rright. Vibration gone. The brake rotors \\rwarped after 23K more miles - Audi \\rrefuses to help.  3 visits to fix leaky \\rw/washer system. It never ends.  I love \\rthis car, but never again.        Excellent alternative to SUV bought certified pre-owned. Owned car \\rfor 6 months now. Very reliable-no \\rmechanical problems.  Only issue was \\rgetting use to transmission lag-I find \\rthere is no turbo lag-the transmission \\rdoesn\\'t shift down fast enough (to \\rimprove fuel economy) causing \\rlag/hesitation. This issue goes away \\rwhen you use the tiptronic shifter. I \\ralso find the lag gets minimized if you \\rgo easy on the gas pedal initially and \\rthen lay into it. This also creates a \\rmore linear power curve. Been driving \\rit around in NE winter storms. The all \\rwheel drive is capable, but not as sure \\rfooted as my Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo \\rin the snow--the Jeep has a slight \\redge.   Awesome, But. . . . .  I love this car more than any others I \\rhave ever owned. But the quality leaves \\ra little to be desired. At 5k miles, \\rthe power steering pump blew up. At 10k \\rmiles the waterpump cracked. Battery \\rkicked out at 12k miles. At 30k miles \\rthe air suspension developed a leak -\\rone the dealer kept insisting they \\rcould not replicate. All items were \\reventually taken care of professionally \\rby Audi. But you have to wonder about a \\rcar that listed at close to $50k new.  Love it with a couple reservations This has been a great family car!!!!! My \\rhusband is European and likes a car that he \\rcan really \"drive\".  This works for us, and yes, \\rwe text drove everything out there.  He drives \\rit with the tiptronic and it gets a bit better gas \\rmilage. It is comfortable for long drives, has \\rbeen steady when driving on flooded and \\rwindy roads; and still turns heads in the \\rpreschool parking lot.  An unexpected benifit \\rof raising the car has been less bending \\rneeded when taking the children out of the \\rcar! Fabulous car! This is one amazing automobile! It is \\rfun to drive, corners as well as our \\rMercedes but has many more creature \\rcomforts. Even with a bit of turbo lag \\rtime, this car can beat anyone out of a \\rstop signal. On a highway, the ride is \\rpeppy, and very comfortable. The car is \\ra rocket going up a steep hill. It\\'s \\rjust a kick to drive!  No need for SUV...  I bought this car in in 2001... fully \\rloaded with 6 speed manual. I had very \\rlittle bugs with it, the only thing I \\rreplaced was the bushing for the front \\rseat... After 40k miles the car runs as \\rsmooth and as fast as the day I bought \\rit. I chipped the car and it produces \\r310 HP and really don\\'t have any turbo \\rlag... the engine feels like a 4.2 V8 \\rwithout the weight. I will keep this \\rcar for another 5 years, it\\'s just that \\rgood!! Hope you will have the chance to \\renjoy this car... Good driving....   Allroad 6 speed The best of all worlds: sports wagon \\rperformance and handling, plus the ability to \\rdo all the back road and off-road driving I \\rwill ever need. Quiet, effortless cruiser at \\r90mph. Manual transmission makes car \\rmuch more lively than autobox. Shifter is \\rnotchy when new, loosens up nicely by \\r10,000 miles. We always run the car in the \\rlowest position for paved road driving: firmer \\rride and much better handling. fun wagon I don\\'t think I would go back to  \\'02 Audi AR  16000 miles & no problems. Turbo lag \\rno problem, can be easily overcome.\\rFun car to drive, still turns heads. Beautiful Headache After two plus years and 46,000 miles, \\rI\\'ve got mixed feelings.  I got the \\rfamous 45 mp wobble, a vibration that \\rstarts at that speed.  The dealer \\rbalanced and aligned wheels \\rrepeatedly.  I lost track of how many \\rbrake rotors they replaced. Finally the \\rAudi rep had the dealer replace the TCM \\r(computer software for automatic \\rtransmission) and it only wobbles above \\r65 mph.  If that one problem could be \\rresolved I could deal with the initial \\rquality problems (all finally fixed) \\rand I would love this car without \\rreservation.  But it\\'s like a nagging \\rheadache.  I should have waited for a \\rsix-speed. Unlike any other Amazing car but had several problems that \\rmake me fear owning this car after the \\rwarranty. Had brake issues and spiral-\\rspring (in the steering wheel). Its a 6-speed \\rand I think the clutch is burning down pretty \\rquickly, but that is not definite yet. \\rPerformance for a vehicle like this is \\runtouchable and I love the engine....all I can \\rsay is WOW. snowtoy It\\'s been a bombproof car.  Amazing in \\rbad weather, quiet comfortable and \\rreliable. best in class I have never owned a car that was as \\rmuch fun the first day as it is today!  \\rPure enjoyment from almost every \\raspect, except the small pre-turbo \\rlag - what a gas this car is.  But \\rspeaking of Gas, please make sure \\ryou have plenty of cash with you at all \\rtimes.  Mileage is not the best, really \\rits not good at all!  From day one \\reveryone has been  interested in \\rwhat the car is and does, I am super \\rhappy with my Allroad! WOW Allroad Wow what an amazing car! My Allroad has \\rbrought me only good things. It\\'s power \\rlooks and (hustler) biturbo just makes \\rme smile. I think no other car i\\'ve \\rowned (ML430,Acura MDX-never buy and \\rLexus RX300 has made me happier. It \\rhandles like a charm, looks like a doll \\rand out runs most sports cars, with \\rhelp from my Audi tunning chip(300hp+. \\rI strongly reccomend this car to \\reveryone! better than any SUV If you are looking in the luxury SUV \\rclass (mercedes, bmw, acura mdx, etc) \\rdont miss this one. It is unique, \\rfast, great interior, more ground \\rclearance than a land rover discovery, \\radjustable suspension, and more \\rluggage space than bmw x-series. Nice car but would not want to own it I leased this car for 4 years.  Thinking back about it, the positives that I remember are that is was comfortable, had nice ergonomics, good looking (if you like a wagon).  The negatives were that it chewed through brakes and tires, had electrical gremlins, not so great build quality, and general quirkiness.  Malfunction lights would light up on the dashboard; when I brought it to the dealership, they would report nothing wrong.  One day the windows would not work ... the next day they did.  Net net, the negatives outweighed the positives.   Best all around car I have owned. I have owned a number of high-end German cars over the years, the allroad is my favorite 4-5 door German car. The Audi a6 allroad has timeless style, will go anywhere in the snow, ice or rain with extraordinary confidence.  This is a great car for wet and snowy weather. The allroad has a very smooth ride and great handling due to the air suspension and quattro (all wheel drive) and still has a sporty feel and good turbo acceleration.  The car has style and classic good looks. In addition to all of the aforementioned this car is very practical; it comfortably carries 4 adults and can be used to haul a variety of things from the garden store/nursery and hardware store.  Audis are luxury cars and generally maintenance is not cheap, if you can\\'t afford to have the car serviced by an Audi dealer you probably should consider another option. Audi still produces A6 allroads, however they have not been imported to the US since 2005. The A4 allroad is a smaller car than the A6. If Audi would import the A6 allroad I would buy another one without hesitation. I love my Audi Alroad Best used car I have ever owned hands down. Even runs better than some new cars I have owned. Great acceleration,handling,braking. So parts are a little more expensive but it\\'s worth it. Plus how cool looking is an Audi anyways? Best car I have owned This car is still as good as the reviews from 2004-5 paint it.  Luxurious, well equipped, safe, phenomenally practical in all weathers and great for those of us who ski, canoe, back pack,  etc.  I carry plant material in the back, and dimensional lumber on the roof rack.   I actually use the adjustable height suspension in snowy conditions, beach driving, and  unpaved back roads.  It works and adjusts on the fly.   But the best part is the engine:  great torque, great sound, and it gives the allroad very good acceleration and passing performance.  I had looked at  2.7l allroads in the early 2000s, and was put off by their lack of punch.  Bought Saab 9-5 Aeros instead.  Have owned Audis, BMWs, old Porsches before.  Car before this was hotrod Outback.   In terms of overall performance, this is the best.There are some drawbacks.  I bought this car 18 months ago, with 60,000 miles on it.  It now has nearly 80,000.  It is expensive to maintain.  I have had to replace large parts of the air suspension system and odd mechanical gremlins are present.   Navigation system and cabin electronics are historical artifacts.   Previous owners had broken or mislaid interior and exterior trim parts. Nevertheless, this car may become a hobby as well as a mode of transportation.   I already have more money in it than I could get out of it, but what could I replace it with?OCTOBER 2016 UPDATE: I stand by my previous conclusion, car is great for long days of high speed driving, etc., etc.   I must note, however that at 86,000 miles the engine self-destructed for no reason that Audi or my independent mechanic could figure out.  There seem to be no rebuilt ones available, and so my Audi dealer found a used 4.2 L engine and installed it in the car.  This  took over a month.  Audi dealer was very cooperative with loaner.   New used engine just as good as the original one, it seems.  Drove it from Portland to and from Bay area recently with no trouble. New Used Quattro Well designed auto.Very comfortable.We enjoy driving.Some difficulty steering, I assume because of the all wheel drive.My wife loves it.Plenty of room compared to other vechicles in it category.I\\'d recommend at least a look. Aways Allroad Sleekly designed wagon with break neck acceleration (biTurbo).  Will reach 80 mph on the highway in a flash (watch out for speed traps)!  AWD keeps this beast glued to the road - especially in the rain.  Every imaginable (and distractable) creature comfort exists in the cockpit.  Seats are \"La-Z-boy\" comfortable.  Red lit interior buttons at night send the coolness factor through the roof!  Factory installed Bose 6 speaker sound system rocks my entire block!   Thank God it\\'s gone It was a dream wagon but turned out to be a nightmare. Goes through tires and brakes with at an incredibly fast pace due to its enormous weight. The suspension is a huge selling point giving you that capability but it was a hassle from day one with failures in the electronics and controls. There were numerous times where the check engine light would come on due to failed electric sensors. The V6, although a twin turbo unit, is underpowered for a car this heavy. I came to know the Audi A3 inside and out as I was in a service loaner A3 more than my actual car as it was in the shop ALL THE TIME. Never own one out of warranty. The warranty companies wont cover them anymore due to its reputation. Allroad Best 4WD Station Wagon We purchased this vehicle because of the harsh winters we have in New Hampshire. If you\\'re looking for comfort, style, reliability and performance this car is a great choice. It powers through snow, great in rain and a pleasure on dry country back roads. Tough and durable without losing grace and style.   13 not out I thought you may be interested from a UK  review. This is my 13th Audi and our 2nd allroad. It is a 2.5 turbodiesel which is the most populat model over here. A tank of fuel produces 515 miles on the cruise. Petrol is too expensive here; US $10.41 per gallon. The turbo lag can be overcome by depressing accelerator a cm or so which gives it time to start spooling up. Allroads are superb vehicles and worth the slight premium over the Volvo.In the UK the A6 and Volvo are the biggest estate cars and more user friendly than pure SUVs. Built better than a BMW, more space than BMW and other drivers admire you but would never let a BMW out at a junction. Audi allroad - perfect driving machine Never had a nicer, more dependable car. Fun to drive, never get stuck in snow and very comfortable. Great car Audi allroad it\\'s a great car, here in europe the diesel 2.5 tdi with 180 cv are the most wanted, very spacious for legs, children and baggage, great engine, with 450 nm/m of binary, excellent quality in interiors and exteriors, good road driving, it\\'s the car that you expect in every situation. Unexpected satisfactions Allroad is continuously giving me unexpected surprises and satisfactions. The build quality, performance and fun to drive. Fuel economy can be improved using higher gear thanks to the incredible wide torque band. Three gears are available for most situations. Can drive as a luxury saloon in an elegant atmosphere, but also as a sporty touring wagon with the exceptional overtaking acceleration, then it turns also a SUV-like vehicle. In short, all in one for every situaion and condition. It\\'s expensive but it\\'s worth. You can find the reasons in almost details even in invisible sections. Looks like even a master piece of craft work. Nice but.... The car drives very smoothly and with a powerful engine allowing for impressive cruising. The strength, solid protective mechanisms, and wonderful brakes allow a family to enjoy this vehicle for both its family size and pleasure of driving. However, I found several of the heavily promoted features to be of little or no use. a jewel on the road An exquisite, elegant design that goes beyond trend since it\\'s introduction in 2001 with it\\'s original design virtually unchanged. I\\'m glad that Audi will not produce allroad anymore (pending it\\'s future concept production) that would give this particular model rare value. 2.7T engine has enough power to smoothly lift 4,200+ lbs. of weight with confidence. Always trustful, impressive quattro all- wheel drive. Superb handling, ride comfort and beautifully crafted interior w/ top quality materials as Audi\\'s tradition. This is a true jewel on the road.    allroad...allright! My wife and I purchased an 2003 allroad with 31K miles. This is my second Audi, we have an \\'98 A4 in the family. Our two bulldogs love the cargo area, and my wife adores the seat warmers. I love the 40-60 MPH acceleration, although sometimes from stop-start is hesitates a little. We are really happy with the car eventhough we have owned her for only three days.  Almost Perfection This car is the best I\\'ve owned.  It combines very good performance with sufficient interior space and a feeling of luxury in its ride, handling and appointments.  And the fuel economy is really pretty good if you drive reasonably.  I\\'ve received compliments on its styling from stangers...and young ones at that.  This one\\'s a keeper. exceptional It seems to do everything exceptionally well.  Its amazing in snow and rain, and even mud.  But still fun to drive like a sports sedan.  Rarely does a car that does so many things competantly do any of them so exceptionally, but the All Road does. The Ideal New England Vehicle I gave up my history of three SUVs for the allroad and have never looked back.  The allaoad gives winter road handling with greater confidence than most SUVs.  But there is no compromise on the pleasure of highway driving.  Greater interior space than most of the current \"trendy\" SUVs (Volvo, BMW). Outstanding Have had my 2005 Audi allroad for over a year and have driven 75% of the miles on snowy mountain roads. The performance has been outstanding. While the car drives on the heavy side, its performance in the mountains and on snow slick roads has been simply amazing. Tiptronic shifting on downhill grades is also an excellent feature. Overall the car is very comfortable to drive and ride. The only downside is that you have to use premium fuel and it gets poor mileage. My overall fuel usage since purchase has been in 16 mpg range. One needs to remember that this is a 4.2 litre V-8 engine which clearly adds to mountain and high altitude (6,500 feet or higher)performance. I traded in a BMW X5 4.0 and find the Audi to be a superior value & higher performance vehicle. The allroad is a winner My 2005 Audi allroad has been great.  I moved from a BMW 330i (lease end) to the allroad.  While the handling is no 330i the allroad has plenty of kick.  I have only driven it in the snow twice and it stuck to the road like grim death.  I love the build quality.  The car is unique and people are always saying they like it and have never seen one before.  I highly recommend this car. allroad review The Audi allroad is the ultimate vehicle.  It provides tremendous performance and road handling capabilities in a unique package that always gets positive stares from other drivers.  Fuel mileage could be improved but the performance is worth it.   I love this car! I have had my 2005 Auti allroad for a few months and I love it! I was rear ended in November, the car (2004 Accord) of the driver that hit me was close to being totaled, I drove away with a few scratches and hardly felt that I had been in an accident. I was very impressed by the safety of my allroad. The State Trooper commented on the way German Cars hold up in accidents.  Audi Allroad Is Fun To Drive The auto allroad is an oveall great car and I love it.  It\\'s easy to drive, has plenty of power and handles well in all weather conditions. The interior is well manafactured and the design features inside are impressive.  The rear leg room and headroom are amazing for this mid size car and are as comfortable as the front seats.  I like the dual climate control, but wish it had heated seats like my husband\\'s Audi TT.  The Bose sound system is better than most luxury cars that I have owned in the past and the speakers are placed all over the interior.  I have had no mechanical problems with the car and everything from the exterior to the interior are holding up beautifully.  I think you\\'ll love it too! Hidden Treasure Our Audi Allroad is at home in any \\rsituation. The perfect commercial \\r(hint Audi) would show this car on a \\rrace track, a snow covered highway and \\roff road in the mud - It has done it \\rall and always delivered! On dry \\rpavement the ride is compliant, and \\rhandling around town or at 80 mph is \\rimpressive.  Rain - see drive pavement, \\rno difference.  Snow/mud - this car is \\rsensational.  The adjustable suspension and \\rall wheel drive give me comfort knowing \\rmy wife and two children are safe if \\rcaught in such a situation.  I have had \\rmany cars, but this is the first that I \\rbought with practical family needs in mind.\\rSafety is the most important thing to me \\rand this car does not disappoint.  It is\\rpractical, safe, and a blast to drive! Wow! What a Car! Sweet car to drive. The power is awesome, and it handles like a sports car.  There hasn\\'t been a day that someone hasn\\'t came up to me and told me how sweet that car looks. This is my third Audi I traded in my A6 for the Allroad. I \\rwanted the features of a wagon but did \\rnot want a suv. This car is fun to \\rdrive, very similar to the A6, but \\rgives greater flexibility to carry \\rlarger items, without sacrificing \\rride, handling, and comfort.   Awesome Allroad Consistent mileage over 24 on the road at 70 \\rMPH+.  Mix of 92 octane and 87 octane seems \\rto work great.  No noticeable turbo lag in \\rsportmode.  Tremendous handling in all \\rconditions, great comfort for 6 footers.  So far \\rhave only 4000 miles on it.  No problems to \\rdate and all maintenance included for 4 years \\ror 50000 miles. LOVE my Allroad! OK everyone....I am the original owner of my 2004 Allroad and was married to an Audi Tech, which helped of course with repairs. He would always tell me myallroad was the exception. I have had very little repair or major issues until past year. I am right now at 226,000 miles on it. I replaced alternator last year and am doing front axle repairs. I have pretty much replaced all air suspension and am on lifetime warranties all 4 wheels with Arnott. My car has been in my driveway now for two weeks and transmission shot. Im debating what to do and working with local tech who has an allroad sitting. Debating whether to do transmisison on mine or buy other allroad or somehow make one great allroad. Im not in a position where I can buy new right now, so decisions are forthcoming...Hmmm great all weather car I bought this at 137k miles so some of the well known problems/maintenance had been performed already.It now has 145k miles and I really like it!superb all weather traction/capability, comfortable, quiet and powerfulSince this is a 6 spd manual car, no troublesome auto tranny issues, but will need a clutch b4 long, Needs both front cv axles replaced (normal wear item), and some oil leaks fixed.  Not as solid build quality as I\\'d thought it would be, several plastic breaking issues. I think this is a great USED car buy IF....proper maintenance has performed and you don\\'t take it to theDEALER, get good independent mechanic.Update: 159k. More oil leaks repaired, expensive hoses($180), windshield( normal wear), brakes, water pump, thermostat (caused overheating ).   Still like the cars capabilities, should be past most wear items for a while ( only paid 8% of original purchase price ).  Great performance after computer remapping ( \\'chip\\'), definitely worth it. 2004 Audi Allroad - Super Car 2.7 V6 Biturbo Bought this car used from a dealer in Rockland Ontario. It\\'s a 2004 Allroad 2.7 V6 5-spd automatc.I was able to find the Audi dealer in Montreal who serviced the car and obtained all the service records from Audi. There was a 50$ service charge but well worth it. The previous owner\\'s name was blacked out but all details were there indicating full professional service and verifying the mileage. After a few weeks I had to replace 2 front upper control arms and fix a transmission oil leak. After 18 months I decided to upgrade the air suspension. Adore my allroad I traded my Lexus RX300 for this 04 Allroad three years ago. The Lexus was wonderful and reliable but the Allroad is so much more fun to drive. The Allroad has 170k and it drives like a new car. I have had some minor problems brake light switch, window regulator, temp sensor, water pump, 1 front ball joint, spark plug coils, 1 cv joint and brake pads. in the last 50k.I have owned a BMW 540i and although I loved it the Allroad is even more fun to drive.My wife drives a Volvo XR-70 which is a wonderful auto but it cannot compare to my Allroad in the fun to drive catagory.My biggest delema now is what to buy next so I have decided to keep this Allroad as long as I can AWESOME CAR! nothing like it on the road Got over 100K miles and drives better than great. Recently forked over a grand to get belts and pump changed as is routine for a vehicle with these many miles. Worth every penny for peace of mind. I can\\'t say enough about the styling. There\\'s no other car out there in this class, new or old, that looks this good. You would think the interior would be dated but looks better than a lot of the newer luxury brands out there. The car looks great both inside and out! Quality superb!Driving dynamics and performance will keep pace with a brand new german or japanese sports sedan any day of the week. \\\\And I have never, NEVER EVER driven a better car or SUV in the snow! AWESOME CAR! German cars are expensive but in my experience reliable if cared for properly as with any car I\\'ve owned my 2004 Audi Allroad 2.7T V6 automatic for 7 years.Still enjoy getting myself behind the wheel each morning.Given the fact I\\'ve pampered the vehicle in a garage for all this time and brought it in for routine maintenance religiously using nothing but synthetic oils, this vehicle has returned the favor by giving me reliable service and performance for 135k and counting. When the time comes to swtich to a new car I have no idea what I\\'m going to do.This car is the perfect blend of German performance, design, luxury, all-weather ruggedness, space and utilitarian conveniences. Can\\'t think of another vehicle in todays market that blend these qualities as well as the Allroad! Hunk of Junk Buyers beware of this Audi at any price!I traded in my wife\\x92s Lexus RX300 with 100K (great car) for a 2004 All Road with 75K.A week after we got the Audi the turn signal failed and the part cost over $100.To make things worse, it is under a front dash plate that is impossible to remove without breaking the cheap tabs that hold the metal clips ($150 to replace).Within a month it started to leak oil and I was told that the seal was a known problem and impossible to replace without a top end tear down (eight hours of labor).I did this repair and the trimming belt at a cost of over $2,600.Then a coil went and I was told to replace all six due to an Audi recall.A few months later warning lights started coming on and sensors that cost $300 plus to replace started to become common.I am now at 90K and I have another oil leak going to the turbo (min $500) and the air suspension has gone bad ($1,700 per wheel and should be done in pairs) and my check engine and ABS lights are going on and off.After owning over 65 cars, this is truly the biggest hunk of junk!Audi should step up and do a recall on the suspension and oil problems. While they did the right thing by discontinuing the \\x93All Road\\x94 model they apparently still have many problems with the A6 (according to a 2010 worst rating survey) and God help you if you have an A8.My brother gave his to the \\x93Cash for Clunkers\\x94 program. 2004 Allroad V-8 4.2 L I bought the car for its looks and engine and having owned another Audi for 10 years.  I must admit it was a fun car to drive but then it started to go down slope after I bought it.  One day, my wife forgot to turn off the lights, somehow both front air- springs went after 8 hours.  That\\'s three grands of repair.  Then the windows switch went bad, and together with the transmission seal, another grand.  Today took my car in for check engine light, the torque converter needs to be replaced, the cost: $3700.  I wanted to keep the car but can\\'t afforest it anymore. Granted I bought the car used, but at 75K miles the car is falling apart.  Is it true that you can only lease Audi now? Best car I\\'ve ever owned This is my sixth Audi Quattro.  I\\'m an AWD only person, living in snowy MI. The V8 and the air suspension are wonderful. The interior is gorgeous, and I can drive it all day and feel SO coddled. I feel that this is a \"no excuses\" car.  No matter the weather, the road (no holes in the oil pan due to rocks!) or the occasion (black tie dinner or plaid shirt camping trip), this vehicle delivers.  I love this allroad. I have the monochromatic silver body and I really like the sophisticated, yet ruggedly athletic, look of this wagon.  My wife\\'s car is a 1995 Audi S6, which is not too shabby, either, but does not have the \"no excuses\" aspect of this allroad...be careful on rocky roads! Great, reliable vehicle I\\'ve owned the car for 3 years and am living in central Idaho.  We received 300+ inches of snowfall this year and have dirt roads to contend with in the summer.  Aside from a couple of minor oversights, like front seat cup holder placements and a split rear seat that only folds one way, this wagon is arguably the best on the road. Coupled with a 6-speed manual gearbox and it delivers excitement at every shift. Amazing car Although the EPA rates this car\\'s mpgs at 19, I found that by being gentle on the gas I could usually get around 25. This was the greatest car I ever owned. Amazing in the snow. Love my allroad Have driven and owned 14 Mercedes Benz cars since \\'86. My last MB was \\'06 ML 350. Bought my 1st Audi and it is perfect in every way. Our \\'04 Allroad is a CPO car in perfect condition. We are 2nd owner and I love driving it, it is an absolute blast. Gas millage is not very good, but I was not looking for an economical car. I probably will drive less 5000 miles per yer.   New allroad owner We had a 2002 Discovery II. Loved the thing! After our son, the Rover was just too impractical. Looked at the Volvo Cross Country and the allroad. Our 04 allroad is the perfect combo. Awesome looks, super nice interior and a turbo! We\\'ve only had it for a few months but so far so good. Do anything This is such an amazing car, you can be flying down the highway at 120 mph in total comfort, then go offroading at 15 mph in the rocks and mud, go drive at 60 mph in the snow in total safety, and carry (inside) 10 feet long molding back from home depot. Very good canyon carver too.  This is the ultimate SUV crossover.  Does it all, does it well. Family in CT We have loved driving this car and find it is an adequate size for our family of 3; we have a 10 year old daughter. We feel very safe in it and love the power and performance of the 2.7T. We wanted to trade it in for a Volvo, as we\\'re looking for a less expensive car; the \\'08 A6 avants are $55,000! Yikes! But when we went to trade it in, the Volvo dealer only wanted to give us $16,000.  We\\'re very disappointed with the fact that this car didn\\'t hold it\\'s value, even though it\\'s been discontinued. We thought there would be a big demand for them! 2004 Audi Allroad 4.2L Bought this car after selling 2001 Allroad 2.7T; liked everything but turbo lag. Love versatility of Allroad; deceptively large cargo area, ski bag great - holds 3-4 skis, so ski rack not needed.  V-8 very responsive, great handling for an SUV-type vehicle, terrific exhaust note.  Fit and finish of both exterior and interior excellent.  Overall, does almost everything I want.  Only wish Audi continued to import Allroad to US.  Plan to hold on to this one for a long time. Real, Solid Value, A \"Keeper\" It seemed pricey at first, but the Allroad delivers.  Great style, amazing performance (on the highway at least), and build quality that MB should strive for (I\\'ve had 15 MBs  and never again). The Allroad is simply amazing.  My only regret is that Audi chose to go for the awful Q instead of bringing in the new Allroad.  Looking at the new A6 it\\'s nice, but no Allroad.   I\\'ve had no problems, wonderful driving experiences (yes, there\\'s the turbo lag thing, but you \"adjust\" ). The Allroad is a competent, accomplished vehicle from a mark that is a benchmark for the interior quality -- shame on Audi for not giving us the new Allroad.   Best of the Germans I have owned a Mercedes, a BMW, a Volkswagen, a Porsche, and my little Opel Kadett in college.  I loved my Boxster S for the pure driving experience, but all told, no car I have owned has matched the Allroad I bought a little over two years ago.  It hasn\\'t given me a stitch of a problem and there isn\\'t anyone who hops in the car with me that doesn\\'t mention how great the car is.  I have even had strangers come up to me asking me about the car.  I like the zip it has on the road when you really need it, and I definitely feel safe in it - it has a real solid feel to it.  It\\'s no Honda when it comes to mileage, but at about 21 mpg (mainly highway driving), I\\'m happy.   Tires are the problem This is our third Audi wagon and second allroad. We are averaging 20 MPG in all kinds of driving.  The car is fast and comfortable and has had few problems. Great combination of luxury and utility I owned a regular A6 2.7T before getting the allroad.  The allroad was a pleasant surprise in almost all respects.  It has all the luxury Audi is known for.  I prefer the Allroad\\'s ride to the regular A6.  It can be raised to SUV height which is great for driving around the city and off road.  It is as good as any vehicle in snow.  It is a genuine autobahn cruiser on the freeway.  The only limitation is hard off road.  It needs beefier tires and it would be dumb to beat up such a nice car with that kind of use.  I don\\'t know why more makes don\\'t offer this great combination of features.  Con: lag is noticeable in regular Drive.  Sport drive helps in newer models. AWESOME!!!!!  OWN NO OTHER CAR I must have asked about 25 allroad owners before I bought this, and I didn\\'t hear one negative thing.  I still ask other owners and honestly have never heard a complaint.  I love this car like no other.  It is epitomized as a sports-car SUV with good MPG.  The 6-speed manual is gutsy and responsive.  The 2.7T is perfect for this car and gives good mileage for a car of its size, weight, and safety.  The way this thing handles on the road is like my previous A4 quattro, but I\\'ve got room for my bike, snowboard and the like.  I really like the fact that this will raise 6-8 inches; I have an SUV with much better gas mileage (manual trans helps) and the power and handling of my previous A4. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome I bought the Audi All Road for my wife.  I got the 4.2 engine for me.  Hauls the family, all our gear, and it hauls fast!  Beautiful with the solid body Black.  Many looks driving this around. Audi allroad I LOVE this car..... The best Audi yet !!! I love this allroad.  This is my 2nd  Twin Turbo bliss My third Audi, this car is wonderful.  \\rInterior appointments are second to \\rnone.  Seats are comfortable for long \\rdrives.  Bose sound system is top \\rnotch.  The car is quick and handles \\rwell for a big vehicle.  Cargo space is \\rexcellent. joy of driving I change a BMW-X5 2001 for this car.It  Great Car Good all around car, perdect for people \\rwho are active in the outdoors and do \\rnot want a large SUV. A good sound \\rsystem and clean interior make for a \\rpleasant ride. More than enough power. \\rInterestingly enough, since we bought \\rthis car, 3 others in our area have \\rbought one and it is a common sight \\raround NW portland. Allroad 2001 Great in bad weather very stylish  excellent experience Great highway cruiser - We spend alot  Perfect Car Needed a car for suburban driving and  Love this car I got the 6 speed O4 version of this car and I love it. \\rFuel economy is not great, although this bothers \\rme more because of more frequent pit stops than \\rbecause of the economy aspect. The car has had \\rsome growing pains with a noticable vibration in \\rthe steering wheel @ 60 mph and a slight clunk on \\rsevere left hand turns. But every day I look forward \\rto getting into this car more and more. ALLROAD Built for the road I traded my BMW X5 for my Allroad, and \\rI enjoy driving my Audi more. It has \\rbetter road feel and the acceleration \\ris comparable. I just finished a 1400 \\rmi. road trip over 5 states, mountain \\rpasses, under many different road \\rconditions, and I can report that there \\rare very few autos that can match the \\rperformance, comfort, and utility of \\rthe Audi Allroad. It is one of the best \\rcars I have ever owned! what a car the allroad I purchased rides like a \\rluxury car with the speed of a sports \\rcar, it has everything in it from xenon \\rheadlights to esp(must read description \\rfrom audi). automatic suspension high \\radjustment for different speeds and \\rtiptronic trans. great car/wagon Traded the 2.7 for the 4.2 I love this 4.2.  2.7 fun but a bit \\rproblematic...turbo lag, engine warning light \\rnever resolved. It was 2001 though, but \\rmostly loved the car. So, this 4.2 is fantastic, \\rthe best features of the 2.7 but better. Full \\rbody color is beautiful, engine is a blast, \\rinterior is gorgeous and beautifully \\rconstructed, if you don\\'t count cupholders. \\rCan\\'t praise this car enough.  Audi\\'s the new standard! After driving large American SUV\\'s for \\r15 years, I thought I\\'d try something \\rdifferent.  WOW! Fit, Finish, Power, \\rHandleing, Acceleration AND AWD? what a \\rpackage... pres turbo lag bad bad fuel millage  No Doubt I am Pleased This is my 5th Audi. I lease every 3  best car I\\'ve had Fuel economy and mild drive-by-wire  you will like them all This is my third Audi and they keep \\rgetting better. I am sold on the \\rcompany and they stand behind thier \\rproduct, but I have never had anything \\rwrong. I have had this car lest than a \\ryear and have put many miles on it fast. A Car For All Seasons We chose this car because it is easy to\\rget in & out of and is very prectical in\\reveryday use.  But unlike other wagons,\\rit has a bulletproof full-time AWD\\rsystem, a great ride, excellent\\rhandling, terrific performance, and an\\radjustable suspension that gives 5.6\" to\\r8.2\" of clearance.  Reliability has been\\rexcellent, and the warranty covers\\reverything for 4yrs/50K miles, including\\roil changes.  A bit better offroad than\\ra Subaru Outback, but rides like a\\rCadillac.  Fuel usage averages 19 mpg;\\rnot bad for a heavy, powerful AWD car. allroad fun car to drive on the highway. The  Mostly good Great car, but had problem with the \\rauto trans; it was replaced within a \\rfew thousand miles on the car.  The \\rdealer was great in helping me with \\rthis problem. The car has had not \\rproblem after this, and it swifts must \\rbetter with the replacement - the lag \\rtime between pushing on the gas & the \\rcar starting to move has improved. I \\rwould buy another allroad, but most \\rlikely with the 8 cyclinder.  The \\rexterior & interior design is \\rextremely nice, though the seats can \\rbe a bit uncomfortable at time - not \\renough side support.  It is altogether \\ra great car to drive in both good & \\rbad weathers. Who Needs an SUV? We swapped an A6 2.7T for the \\rallroad.  It is simply awesome... my \\rwife doesn\\'t ever want to give it up!  \\rGreat acceleration, braking, steering \\rfeel, very comfortable, large cargo \\rarea, adjustable suspension, towing \\rcapacity.  Love the beige interior.  I \\rget more looks driving this than my \\r2002 A4 avant w/sport pkg.  I think \\rits the wheels/flared arches and \\raluminum accents. love the car!!!!!!! Love this auto even more than my last amazed! I drove mercedes e class for last 10 \\ryears. I was amazed at the overall \\rquality and attention to detail. Feels \\rlight, nimble and rock solid.  \\rExcellent performance.  The perfect \\rblend of luxury and utility.   allroad...allright! This is one beautiful car. The interior \\ris outstandingly elegant and practical. \\rThe 2.7 is a sweet engine, but the \\rturbo lag does take some getting use to.\\rBuild quality is very good to \\rexcellent, but does not equal the \\rJapanese hi-qual cars. It\\'s a delight \\rto drive under all weather conditions. \\rThe styling has it all over the boxey \\rVolvo wagon IMHO! The car doesn\\'t need \\ra V-8, even though one is now \\ravailable. An upgraded chip for the V-6 \\radds another 65 hp! Fuel economy is not \\rgreat, but the range with the 18.5 \\rgallon tank is still good at 350 miles. \\rThe adjustable height suspension is a \\rnice feature.  My opinion Solid ride,ease of access and easy view \\rof all controls (both daylight and \\rnighttime.Driver\\x92s seat and passenger \\rseat have power adjustable.The driver \\rhas lumbar suprt. Stiffness of ride can \\rbe adjusted. The higher you raise the \\rcar softer it is. Lowest great for \\rhighway. In town raise it one setting \\rso it will smooth out city potholes. It \\rhas twin turbo\\x92s but that unfortunately \\rincludes turbo lag, which can be \\rcompensated for by using the Tip-tronic \\rshifting when necessary. My car came \\rwith ESP and handles like its on rails. \\rIt\\x92s an SUV with touring car comfort. \\rVersatile. allroadchuck Have a home in Palm Springs and in \\rCripple Creek,Colorado.Spent the month \\rof July in Colorado,and just drove the \\rauto.Love it.Can it climb. Swiss Army Knife of All Trades Who needs a SUV when car like this  Audi All Road This is a great car Everything about is \\rsuper first class. It is fun to drive, \\rgreat looking. practical and a great \\ralternative to a full blown SUV. It is \\rall wheel drive, handles and drives \\rlike a luxury sedan and has all the \\rutility of an SUV The \"end-all be-all\" crossover vehice this vehicle is trully the \"end-all be-\\rall\" crossover vehicle.  Drives like a \\rproformance car but carries a load.  \\rLooks good on the strip or in a stream. \\rversatility makes this a star. Amazing \\rhandling on all road surfaces, this car \\ralso handles extreme driving conditions \\rwith ease.  I am not a dealer, or stock \\rowner, but this car fits in tight \\rspaces and feels as solid as a truck.  \\rPeople mover or furniture carrier, this \\rcar does everything... trully; \"the \\rultimate driving machine.\"  Be Careful of Automatic Transmission The ZF Automatic Transmission is known to have MAJOR problems in this car.Audi apparently was aware that the 2001-2004 Allroads had bad transmissions but never did a recallThe first thing to go is Reverse Gear.It slips when going uphill backwards.Reverse might be okay on level ground but not on inclines/hills.It\\'s a very costly $4,000+ repair and you can\\'t replace it with a used transmission because that one will also probably go bad.It must be rebuilt.Audi changed the transmission in 2004 or 2005 because they were that bad. Best Car Ever Made I love my Audi Allroad. All of my family and friends can\\'t believe it when they see this car, it is beautiful. It is ULTRA luxury, ULTRA comfort and the nicest car, I have ever owned for what I need - family / sporty enough for a \"Guy\". It is awesome for my family, trips and just to cruise and it is also a lot of fun when I am alone. It\\'s twin turbo is quick and I have never been so happy and felt so suited with a car for a combination of all my needs and still an unbelievably \"hot\" car. And if you take trips to the mountain and do any winter driving then this car is a MUST. 5 Stars. It was the best of cars..it was the worst of cars Purchased 2003 Allroad in September \\'05; parted ways in November \\'11. I chose the car for practicality and a need to be able to get around in winter..no matter what. It was perfect for that and was super comfortable on long trips. The downside: it went through tires and brakes like crazy. I am embarassed to admit how much I spent in repairs: the front suspension bladers, turbos, heater over and over, etc. Even my mechanic told me I could not afford to keep it.I will miss the winter reliability, but not the drain on my bank account. 99 Problems but a Hörch ain\\x92t one I killed my Audi today. After almost four years of Allroad ownership I should be qualified to write a thoughtful and informative review of my experience. Alas, I\\x92ve spent more time in and out of cheap rented harlots; Nissan Sentras, Chrysler PTs, Toyota Camrys, KIA Optimas and Chevy Cobalts, while my Audi slept in greasy mechanics shops with her claws on my credit card. If you like money in your pocket, don\\x92t buy this Audi. If you like to drive your own car, don\\x92t buy this Audi. If you, like me, are a masochist, hell-bent on suffering and burning money, check out the Audi Allroad. My Audi was four years of abject languish, watching something I love destroy itself and my finances. Do not buy an Allroad These cars are great for a while...like a short while.Like another poster said, each shop visit is going to cost 4 digits and they are going to happen a few times a year...not to mention 800 dollars tires.They are hungry Brake eaters as well...there is another $800 routine maintnance bill.They are money pits, but I did love it when it was behaving. Not fun to fix I loved driving the allroad, but I hated to fix it.  Every time it went to the shop it needed at least $1000.  Leaks here, bad parts there, $90 oil changes, Mine was becoming such a money pit I was glad to sell it at a loss.   The 2.7T can be tuned to make great power, but it also leaks oil like a sieve and is expensive to fix.  Parts go bad on these cars far short of what I would consider an acceptable life span.    I love it, warts and all This car is now 7 years old, approaching 100K miles, and still looks and drives like new! I like this car so much I\\'m willing to tolerate its high maintenance; I recently needed a new clutch and brakes; tires last for one year; the 105K maintenance is due soon ($$$). I have owned a BMW X5 and a Subaru Outback with similar functional images, but there\\'s really no comparison to this Audi. It\\'s a silly car in a way: the manual trans\\'s first gear is so tall that this car is a clutch-burner off-road and on boat ramps. I use this car to pull a boat trailer, haul bikes, kayaks, camping and skiing equipment, and drive fast, especially in the snow. My adult kids like to borrow it when they\\'re in town You can do everything with it I wanted a car that was stylish and had good performance and handling, all while providing enough space to haul my equipment and tools around because I am a contractor. I have never been disappointed with this car. For work or play it delivers. I am not a fan of SUVs, because you really can\\'t drive and have fun. You forget that you are in a wagon. IT IS A GREAT CAR WITH GREAT LOOK! Is a great car when not in shop This is my 2nd Audi, my previous one was the A6 sedan. I have driven other luxury cars and nothing is more comfortable for long or short drives than the Audi. My 1st Audi I sold at 102K miles, unfortunately this one is having all the same problems as the last one and the extended warranty is running out. I bring my car into the shop 5 or 6 times a year beyond my religious tire rotation and oil changes. You must be religious on rotating tires every 5K-6K miles just to get 20K miles out of them.  This is unique to the Allroad.  Both area dealers have excellent service,and they are prompt with loaner cars. Excellent car as long as it is under warranty.    Partially Underrated Very good, safe vehicle. Convenient. Great on winter roads to go skiing \\x96 perfect; never put winter tires on it and never slipped once. I don\\x92t like the rugged bumper-look, however, you do spend most of your time on the inside looking out, so the interior must be super-good, and it is, comfy and lots of gizmos. Variable ground clearance is the coolest \\x96 it\\x92s why I got it. I expected it all to be broken by now, but 100,000 miles later it still works (and I use that toy). They say EPA is 16/23 city/high: my combined average is 22.1mpg at an average speed of 33mph, but I am a very gentle/boring driver. Overall smooth and relaxed vehicle; go anywhere any speed, over a pass or valet parking.  allroad Very fun to drive. Quick and nimble considering it is a great snow car. Aggressive looking enough not to be ignored and subdued enough not call for unwanted attention. Fun for longer road trips and a great every day kid (2,4) hauler.   Best all arround ever After having 3 and 5 series BMW crossovers and SUV, I finally got the Allroad. Wish I had gotten one years ago. Amazing ride, power, versatility, comfort. Quattro system is a blessing in bad weather, adjustable suspension works like a charm, family dog loves riding in the back separated by standard mesh screen. Perfect! Do yourself a favor and get one now! Great Car Just purchased a CPO recently.  A truly wonderful car.  Love the exterior and interior design.  Real comfortable ride, kinda like driving a suped up Caddie.  Feels like a bigger vehicle than it appears.  Though heavier than most wagons, this gives me a safer feel.  Performance has been very suprising so far.  Instrumentation is a bit confusion though.  Overall, great car. Audi from Hell After 30,000 miles the Audi sevice people gave up on trying to fix the surge/lag problem that my 2003 Audi allroad has developed. I have spent $6,100 on new turbos (2),a  torque converter, ECU, transmission control unit...etc. This car has had roughly $10,000 in warrenty work with no fix. Now they have made me an insulting offer to get me out of the car as a \"courtesy\" to buy another piece of junk Audi.  I\\'ve owned Audi or Volkswagen products since, my 1970 Audi super 90, 1978 Scirocco, 1987 Quantum, 1998 A4 Avant, and 2003 allroad and after all that they make a lame offer of settlement.  It\\'s Audi\\'s service problem not mine. Unless things change and change dramatically I will never buy another Volkswagen or Audi product again...GO Toyota !!! Audi allroad 2003 Successful blend of utility and comfort,\\rgood looks; fun to drive. Power. Roomy.\\rMany useful features like the ski\\rstorage, the net in the luggage area,\\retc. Unlike with other German cars,\\rcontrols and information display are a\\rperfect compromise between completeness\\rand ease of use. Very comfortable seats,\\radjust easily. Cons: Insufficient lumbar\\rsupport, road rumble, excessive tire\\rwear ($800 per set every 20,000 miles),\\rpronounced delay of turbines on dead\\rstart, initial glitches that are typical\\rfor German cars. But with the excellent\\rAudi service at Maplewood Imports, I\\rhave trouble remembering the details of\\rthe faults. The care now runs flawlessly. Audi Allroad Excellent in winter conditions very dissapointing turbo lag is huge Car gets lost in comparison I am a wagon fan.  We used to drive \\rVolvos, but shifted to Audis after \\rnumerous test drives.  The Audi Allroad \\ris the most complete car we have had.  \\rGreat interior and exterior, great \\rsound system, fun engine, great \\rversatility because of the pneumatics \\rthat allow you to increase clearance at \\rthe touch of a button, the only \\rdownside is very average gas mileage \\rand some parts problems from third-\\rparties.  Having had both, there is no \\rcomparison between this car and the \\rVolvoXC70 (which is a great car) - the \\rAllroad is just better -- more fun, \\rmore capable.  If I had to have only \\rone car (and didn\\'t need a third row of \\rseats) this would be it. Awesome with some minor adjustments Great car that I love to go to work \\rin. The 1.2hr commute each way is a \\rbreeze. Don\\'t like the lag but I have \\rto adjust to it as I did on the ML. \\rWipers were misaligned. Got that \\rfixed. Noisy and squeeshy brakes - \\rdon\\'t like. With bike rack fairing, \\rthe buffet-thumpning wind at 45 with \\ropen sunroof stopped. No more problems \\rthere. OEM tires feathered out at \\r8500m. Rotated and will need to \\rreplace soon already. Stupid \\raccel/resume button for cruise control. Better than PORSCHE Cayenne S The allroad offers more amenities for \\rthe money, incl. air suspension, rear \\rseat heaters and OnStar, which is \\rextra on the Cayenne S and standard \\ronly on the Cayenne Turbo (actually \\rOnStar not available at all). Also the \\rallroad\\'s on pavement handling is \\rbetter and smoother then any of the \\rtwo Cayennes. They do feel more \\rlike trucks. The interior in the allroad \\ralso appears to be more \\runderstated and elegant. Needless \\rto say the AUDI materials are real, vs \\rthe Cayenne\\'s painted plastic. My 6th Audi - they keep getting better Why would anyone get an SUV?  Beats me.  Moved up to an Allroad We have put almost 7k miles on this car since \\rwe purchased it it the end of  Jan. 03. I was \\roriginally going to replace my A4 with an A4 \\rAvant, but travel / space requirements moved \\rme up to the Allroad. This vehicles took some \\rtime to get used to after my 1.8T. But, driving \\rto Central Oregon through rain, snow, etc. has \\rbeen a joy. The acceleration through the \\rmountains is fanastic. I was able to pass at \\rtimes where the A4 required major advanced \\rplanning. The family/ friends also appreicate \\rthe extra room in the back seat.  I have been \\raveraging 20.2 mpg. For the weight of this \\rvehicle, this is not too bad. Most beautiful wagon-who needs an SUV An amazing car. It is too bad that Ausio chose  not my parents\\' wagon Shopped wagons for new family but \\rstill love to drive.  Tested Passats, \\rVolvo XC, Saab, BMW 3 & X5, Audi A6.  \\rAll good cars but 2003 allroad really \\rstood out.  Looks cool, great build \\rquality, perfect utility, spacious, \\rtop comforts, quick and fast.  Turbo \\rputs your head back and no lag with \\rmanual.  Handling softer than our A4 \\x96 \\rwider steering, longer shifter throws, \\rocc tire give in fast corners \\x96 but \\rstill always a hoot.  For a wagon it \\rdazzles.  We actually use variable \\rsusp (low hghwy, high city) with very \\rdifferent drive feel.  More money than \\rrunner-up Passat but way more fun. sporty & fun to drive I\\'m extremely happy with my purchase. \\rThe car is extremely safe & well built.\\rI needed something safe to drive \\raround in with my family. I also love \\rthe allroad feature plus that you can \\rraise & lower the vehicle, this came \\rvery handy with all the snow that we \\rhad this year. The vehicle really \\rsticks to the road. It has a sporty \\rappearance & the quality & elegance of \\rGerman engineering. I also own an Audi \\rA4 and remain a loyal Audi customer.\\r  The Service departments & customer \\rservice are excellant. You are treated \\rlike a King. utility and comfort Elegant style, more subtle and \\rcomfortable ride than the X5 or ml \\rclass. Engine powerful, quiet and \\rsmooth, turbo lag is not that apparent \\ronce one gets use to the trottle. Best Car Ever Lots of exclusivity and support from  My review This car is totally great idea for the \\rpeople interested in offroad use and \\rdon\\'t want to give up the luxury, in \\rother words those who don\\'t want the \\rhassles of a huge sport utility. Just leased my second Allroad Had a 2001 for two year with no \\rproblems, although turbo lag is less \\rthan joyful.  But for fit, finish, \\rsilence and downright useability it is \\ra superb machine for its avowed purpose.\\rTaking delivery in two weeks on a 2003 \\rAllroad with same equipment and using \\rthe $2,000 Audi Loyalty contribution.\\r Wish there were broader exterior color \\rchoices and happier less dark interior \\rcolor combinations - but that aside, \\rthis longtime Audi wagon owner is quite \\rhappy to go back to zero miles and \\rstart again with a totally reliable \\rGerman high quality machine. Thought she\\'d never own an SUV My wife just traded an A6 2.7T sedan \\rfor her Allroad. She\\'s wanted a wagon \\rfor years and hates SUVs & Minivans.  \\rShe loves AWD, and strong performance \\rso the Allroad is perfect.  It\\'s a \\rgreat blend of interior space, \\rgorgeous interior & brisk performance \\r(the new tiptronic is much more lively \\rthan the one in her \\'00).  The more \\raggressive styling is pleasant without \\rbeing overly masculine.  We would do \\rwithout the variable suspension, since \\rwe\\'ll never off-road, but it may be \\ruseful if we have another winter like \\rthe last in PA. I can\\'t go back for less anymore I have to drive this car everyday and it  360 degree eye catcher This is my first german built car.  It \\ris the best car I\\'ve ever owned.  \\rInterior quality is superior and rear \\rseating is confortable and \\rsurprisingly roomy.  The driver\\'s side \\rentry is a tight fit.  But once \\rinside, the car is pure car-comfort \\rheaven.  Tiptronic was fine for my \\rprevious 300M, but I much prefer 6spM \\rfor the Allroad.  I would not go back \\rto tiptronic, even in 4.2L. Snow Snow Snow I just survived the Denver blizzard of \\r2003. I had to drive in a foot and half \\rof wet, heavy snow. I raised the \\rsuspension to the top and drove \\rthrought the crud with ease. As I \\rpassed the abandoned suburbans and \\rjeeps I asked myself, \"Where are the \\rcameras? What a commercial for Audi \\rthis would be!!!\" ALLROAD Station wagons are cool again...it\\'s \\rhard to be cool with two booster seats \\rin back, but this car helps. This car \\ris fun to drive(6 spd), has a beautiful \\rinterior, and has an impressive list of \\rsafety features. After owning a car for \\r8 mos. I am usually starting to think \\rabout what\\'s next, but I would buy the \\rAllroad again today in a heartbeat No more SUV\\'s for me.... sports car handling, adjustable \\rsuspension, luxury....the perfect \\rurban assault vehicle! I love this car! We were looking for a car to take the \\rplace of our Merecedes wagon -- one \\rwith more creature comforts \\r(cupholders, a decent air conditioner \\retc.), yet being able to handle as well \\ras a Mercedes. The allroad fit our \\rneeds perfectly. It is fast: 250 hp, \\rtwin turbo. It is slightly higher than \\ra tradional car, so the visibility is \\rbetter. It is luxurious inside, it\\'s \\rvery responsive and it\\'s a kick to \\rdrive. What more could you ask for? Best SUV/All purpose vehicle made The best part of this car is that it is \\rgreat at EVERYTHING!  Overall quality \\ris second to none! The \\rperformance/handling/power is better \\rthan luxury performance sedans plus, it \\rperforms the same in the RAIN where the \\rothers have to change their driving \\rhabits, the Allroad performs the same \\rin the rain as it does so well on the \\rdry!  The adjustable suspension gives \\rme more ground clearance than most \\rSUV\\'s - If this isn\\'t enough it is a \\rblast in the snow - absolutely \\runstoppable!  I am 35 - with a young \\rfamily - it gives me the flexibility of \\ra wagon in a fun, \\rprogressive/aggressive package - This \\ris not my mother\\'s Volvo wagon!!! fantastic a great fun family car The most obscure Audi Someone has probably already called the \\rallroad, the Swiss Army Knife of \\rautomobiles. They\\'re correct.\\r The version of the allroad that makes \\rnot only this \"universal soldier\" \\rimpression, but adds to it a huge dose \\rof near sports sedan performance and \\rfun is the manual transmission version. \\r This car, unknown to most people is THE \\rone car to have if you can have only \\rone -- it can go anywhere, anytime, \\rkeep up with most everything else on \\rthe road and allow you and your \\rpassengers to arrive in style, comfort \\rand safety. Best Car On the Road I bought this because my boyfriend has \\ran A4. Is he jealous now! Not only is \\rthe bi-turbo engine extremely fast, but \\rthe car handles better than any SUV \\rI\\'ve ever driven on rugged Colorado \\rmountain roads. It is by far the best \\rcar I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of \\rowning. And it\\'s good lookin to boot! Love the car, hate the reliability. We have a love hate relationship with \\rthis car. In much the same way as you \\rlove the blacksheep of the family. Our \\rallroad is fast (abeit with a little \\rlag), smooth and very well thought out. \\rThe interior is prety much perfect, as \\ris the exterior styling. It has and \\rdoes everything we need as a family car \\rwith great aplomb.\\r On the flip side it has been off the \\rroad for more than 2 weeks in less than \\r16k miles. The brakes were redone 3 \\rtimes, new turbos have been installed, \\rnew interior lights, some squeeks and \\rrattles were fixed, new drivers seat \\rframe & motors, and a new gearbox was \\rinstalled. This was all covered by the \\rwarranty but when is enough enough? First 10months A great \"compromise\" between \\rperformance, luxury and utility!  \\rBetter gas mileage and a more side \\rsupportive seat would be appreciated \\rbut overall a very special vehicle \\rthat is a joy after almost a year. One \\rmechanical problem fixed immediately \\rby dealer and none since. Needs Work My Allroad has been in the shop \\rmore times than I\\'ve driven it. From \\rout of round tires, 4 sets of rotors \\rreplaced, squeeking seats, to an \\rengine that needs to have it\\'s heads \\rreplaced.  I love th elook and comfort \\rbut  I can\\'t justify paying $45000 just \\rfor that.  Although this car is crud, the \\rAudi service center and customer \\rservice has been outstanding. turn the esp off ! Best car I ever owned , and I got 14000 \\ron it! HOWEVER , I live in upstate NY \\rand as soon as the roads get slick , \\rshut OFF the esp . It drives so much \\rbetter that I wonder why it\\'s \\rincluded.When it\\'s on in slick \\rconditons the car is way worse than my \\ra4 quattro that did not have it.\\rVery fast , why chip it ? Very \\rcomfortable. I do use the adjustable \\rsuspension with work , driving on farms \\ron dirt roads, it\\'s great ! So Far...GREAT CAR! I have wanted an Allroad for 2 years, \\rbut the 9 month wait for a 6 speed \\ralways sent me away.  Found one on the \\rlot last week and bought it \\rimmediately.  Why would anyone buy the \\rauto, when the 6 speed is so much more \\renjoyable.  Best way to do away with \\rturbo lag is wind it out a bit before \\rshifting.  And if it breaks...they fix \\rit for 4 years.  Hope all remains \\rwell...it\\'s great so far!!! Great car Traded up from an A6 wagon.  Liked the \\rA6 but like the Allroad even better, in \\rparticular the increased power and \\rgeneral updates.  It\\'s a great car. Wooowwwww!!! I bought this excelent built half wagon  Neat Machine Fantastic substitute for an SUV!  I \\rupgraded from a VW Passat 4Motion and \\ram still impressed by the craftsmanship \\rof this car (and the VW was pretty \\rimpresssive in it\\'s own right).  So \\rmany great features, but inexplicably, \\rno GPS moving map (in the US, the \\rEuropean models do have it).  Everyone \\relse has cashed in on this feature, why \\rnot Audi? Very Impressed... I just picked up a 2002 Audi allroad quattro this week, and I couldn\\'t be \\rhappier with its performance and elegant interior.  Externally, it\\'s one of the \\rbest looking cars are the road - wagon or sedan.  \\r The car handles very well.  The only drawback with the allroad is the poor \\rfuel economy.   Nevertheless, the car is amazing.  After I had considered \\rmany SUVs (i.e. X5, ML 320, RX 300, GX 470), I\\'m very glad I decided to get \\rthe allroad.  Its aggressive styling, performance & utility made it the best \\roption for my family.  \\r Rich\\rTorrance, CA Like a Rock ! By far, this is the most comfortable \\rcar I have driven for long trips. The \\rride is just soo much better than the \\rBMW 3 series. The cargo space is much \\rbigger than other SUVs and wagons. The \\rpowerful bi-turbo engine is a sheer \\rdelight. The AWD system, safety \\rfeatures, curtain airbags, and Onstar \\rservice makes me safer on trips. Anything but fuel efficient Great car, great ride, coolest kid on \\rthe block.  However, fuel efficiency \\rsucks! great vehicle Having owned two Landrover 4.6\\'s and a \\rBMW X5-4.4 in the four years before \\rtrying this car, I didn\\'t know whether \\rI would like it.  Love it!  Quieter, \\rroomier and more reliable than the \\rBMW.  Much faster than the Rovers.  \\rKind of funny looking but a great \\rdriver and quite quick.  Turbos are \\rgreat in the mountains. all roads \\'Start\"  from here.  Nothing beter for taking our long \\rawaited vacation to MN\\'s \\'North Shore\\' \\rIt is a magical place for its beatyful \\rcolor vistas, Nice roads compred from \\rlast year should make thi one the bes \\rever,,no small thanks to our allroad \\rand the many features that make a long \\rroadtrip not only bearable but \\rdownright exceptional Loved it... but it beat my wallet into submission This was a fantastic car.  I had a 2002 purchased with about 45K mi on it.  It was immense fun to drive, thirsty, and practical.  However, once things started to break... I had trouble finding mechanics that would work on it, then the bills were staggering.  I sold the car with 120K mi on it after the final straw fell... while on a long road trip the alternator failed - not a big deal, but the repair was $1.1K!  Timing belt and other minor work was $5k, clutch was $3k... it was just crushingly expensive to keep alive.   But it was AMAZING when it worked right!  If you\\'re a mechanic, or are friends with one, then go ahead and buy one.\\r quick, powerful, smooth..... BUT.... My audi has 160,000 miles bought it not too long ago has no major problem but the oxygen censer gave up on me. other than that drive like new. the turbos are very nice has very little lag, it pick ups on the highway. the car hauls and has won me a race with a 740 bwm.my only big concern is the mpg in the city! this car really shine in the highway. for the power that it has it ok but i would love to see me squeezing a bit more on my fuel tank. Fully Mature, Past 100k I am the third owner of this steroidal, German brute. This car was never designed to be a drag racer...so no need to treat it like one. Where this car truly shines is the open freeway and out in the open wild. Where can you get on-rail handling and passing power of a Porsche? Where can you charge down a snowy, dirt road at nearly 75mph with confidence? How about scale a  25% grade complete with ruts, roots and loam and not even break a sweat with wheel spin?  Audi and its Torsen AWD is everything today\\'s crossover/SUV owner wants. This car simply has Bentley comfort and Porsche performance. Is it worth the upkeep costs?  YES.  Life is too short to be driving dull, uninspiring cars! 7 yrs old and 90K miles and still like it I really like this car. Mix of sporty, utility, and family wagon.  Mine is 6 speed manual (rare) with the factory jump seats in the back (even more rare) so seats 7 (5+2kids).  It\\'s the best SUV.  Drives like an Audi ... but ... I knew that by purchasing a used Allroad I may have had problems with the air suspension. but didn\\'t expect so soon. Within 3 months I spent 1000 dollars per side (yes ... they are pricey). Then because the car is so heavy, I am experiencing problems with the ball joints (other common problem). Tire wear is abnormal. Overall it is a great car to drive, very comfortable ... but I wouldn\\'t buy another one. The Volvo XC is much better option and without those expensive air shocks. Good at first, horrible, then great! I bought this car with 110,000 miles on it in spring in northern NH, ahem: MUD. awesome in it however, when the winter months came the suspension BLEW completely gone, and it was horrible, I had been told that it was  common problem and goes away with warm weather, so i had it checked out, an air suspension sensor had fried, and was replace for roughly $300, had the timing belt done, and now it RUNS LIKE A CHARM, i love this car, i will always drive an Audi, perhaps something a bit cheaper to fix, but i <3 Audi of America. At an annual Audi owners of America banquet which i worked at and found all too ironic, i told them I drove an allroad, and many were jealous, i get daily compliments. A fun family hauler No problem with the car, once you know how to get off the line no problem with the turbo lag. The only issue I have is these front brakes, have only 54,000 miles on it and I am on my second set and the warping happened again after 5000 miles of driving.  Always use permium fuel 91 or higher and the mileage I get is about 25-30 miles, mostly urban driving. Fun car, but expensive maintenance A really fun car to drive and very convenient for all activities.  I can put my bike or kayak on the roof rack, and even slide my bike in the back with the seat down.  Great options, love the back-up beeper, heated seats, etc.  My only issues are the less than stellar gas mileage, especially when using premium gas (pricey) and maintenance and repairs are VERY pricey once the 50K warranty and maintenance plans expire. Not without problems Extra wide fenders over tires make manevering a challenge; fun to drive, but MANY issues with engine and transmission.  Additionally, tire wear much higher than average and fuel well below rating. All in all not sure I would buy another Audi.  Not sure there is a significant advantage to an all-road over an A6 AWD. On the rail and quick acceleration The great satisfaction after one year ride. This purchase was the compromise of a sporty sedan and a SW, and perfectly satisfied the both. Remember, this is a near 2 tons weight of SUV-like wagon, but you can still drive it like a sport car on hwy or pwy. It goes exactly on the rail in almost any situation even with heavy rain or few inches of snow. Overtaking acceleration is excellent. (Use premium gas, that makes a difference!) The interior is chic and elegant with no complaints (for extra cup holders, use the openable sidepocket or the one under the rear seat). The build quality is definitely better than the same generation A6. Overall, the long lasting state of the art. Audi Allroad This car is AMAZING!!! Great car to cart the kids around and have fun while doing it. The 2.7 twin turbo gives out plenty of performance while the car is still very practical. The car handles extremely well and handles everyday abuse. Will reach very high speeds on the highway with extreme confidence. Excellent hwy hauler Purchased this car certified used.  Got plenty of compliments about the way it looks (i.e. expensive).  People at work were questioning if I got some secret raise.  As far as driving the car, it\\'s not quite the drivers car but I knew that coming in.  What it excels in is a highway hauler.  I needed something to drive up to Lake Tahoe hauling my skis, mtn bike, and friends while cruisng in comfort.  Once this car is on the highway it just hauls and is very quiet and comfortable.  Much more than an Outback I use to own. Turbo/transmission lag is annoying and heard it can be fixed with an aftermarket ECU.  Also when the car is cold it feels like it\\'s running on 4 cylinders. love my car I have never owned an Audi before my\\r2002 allroad.  it\\'s a solid-feeling, safe car,\\rwhich is very important to me because I have two \\rsmall children.  I feel in complete \\rcontrol with this car.  \\r My last vehicle was a Jeep Cherokee.  It \\rhad too much play in the steering \\rwheel.  I wasn\\'t comfortable on the \\rturns to the extent that I never \\rwanted an suv again.  So, with this \\rcar I have the 4-wheel drive i need \\rduring the winter, but it\\'s low to the \\rground, comfortable and, again, solid. A Delight to Drive We wanted SUV performance without the  Keep accelerating--it will go eventually The acceleration lag in this car in \\reveryday city driving is horrible.  \\rIn \"D\" mode, very high RPM before it \\rshifts through the lower gears. \"S\" \\rmode is a little better.  On several \\roccasions, I\\'ve stepped on the gas \\rfrom a stop and literally nothing \\rhappens unless the accelerator is \\rpumped.  Good thing no oncoming \\rtraffic or I would have been a sitting \\rduck.  From what I have read on this \\rsite, this is not unusual.  Anyone \\rhave any solid feedback from Audi on \\rthis issue? Big Hat, No Cattle... When I first saw this car, i thought \\rWOW!! that\\'s one cool car.  Audi\\'s \\rhave usually delivered \"the goods\" \\rwith regard to performance, but, alas \\rthis car is somewhat disappointing.\\rturbo lag is very evident (automatic \\rtransmission); so far so that a group \\rof disgruntled owners are petitioning \\raudi of america to fix the \"problem\" \\ras they call it a safety hazard.  \\r other HUGE performance problem is \\rwith the brake rotors.  my allroad has \\r32,000 miles and i\\'m on my fourth \\rset...that is completely unacceptable.\\r driver door rattled from the first day, \\rbut always intermittently, so the \\rrepair guys thought i was an idiot...\\r   belvedere to much turbo lal bad fuel mileage  allroad --  segment busting since 2001 This vehicle does so many things much \\rbetter than adequately: blasting down \\rthe freeway on the lowest suspension \\rsetting, sliding around backwoods \\rAdirondack dirt roads, plowing through \\rsnowbanks up on the highest setting, \\rpacked full of (heavy) band equipment \\rwithout noticable wheezing or whining, \\rand then cleaning up very nicely when \\rcalled upon to do personal limousine \\rduty.\\r The only serious con continues to be \\rthe (perhaps) intentionally engineered-\\rin transmission lag ... but allroad \\rdrivers learn to use sport or tip mode \\rto lessen its effects.    a fine compromise Aside from the severe color pallete \\rthat Audi seems to prefer for offroad \\rvehicles - and interior colors which \\rremind me of the German Army Wermacht \\runiforms -- the car itself has been \\rtotally reliable, does all I have ever \\rasked, and if it were not leased, I \\rwould chip the engine and transmission \\rfor more oomph both from Stratmosphere \\rin Rush, NY -- but no complaints at \\rall.  also have a great dealership. One of the most amazing cars ever I cant say anything but WOW. When i got in  got one the car is very sporty-a good small  Audi Quattro Allroad Fun to drive, Technically superior to \\rany vehicle I have driven This Car Does It All This is an excellent sports wagon,\\rbest-in-breed for a wintertime vehicle,\\ras well as crusing at 100+ mph.  It\\'s\\ragle, fast, sure-footed, and\\rwell-engineered.  This car can take on\\rthe bush or carry a family to the mall\\rwith aplomb.  The auto-tranny is good;\\rthe 6-spd. is great!  After 10K miles,\\rreliability has been excellent. AllRoads Lead to the Audi After a thorough review of sports sedan \\rvs sport ute, I found the Audi to be \\rthe best hybrid of both.  It has the \\roff road capabilities of any \"commuter\" \\rsport ute on the market and the \\racceleration and handling of a great \\rsports sedan.  I Love the fact that \\rmany people see it as a \"whimpy wagon\" \\runtil they\\'re breathing my exhaust as I \\rfly to 60 in 6.8 seconds :o)  After 2K \\rmiles it is performing beutifully.  I \\rhope to enjoy it for the long haul. The Allroad is no Wagen I use to drive an A4 and then had my \\reye on the TT.  I had one problem.  I \\rcouldn\\'t fit the kids in the TT.  The \\rnext best thing was the Audi Allroad.  \\rMy kids fell in love with it in the \\rshow room.  Now when I go on trips we \\rtake the Allroad and leave the \\rWindstar at home.  It\\'s too much fun \\rto drive, so why leave it at home. shop hog mother owns car i see it every day.Has  All Road All The Time Fit and Finish outstanding.  Handling \\ris very comfortable from a car of its \\rweight.  This car is a dream come \\rtrue for the driver who wants \\reverything in a car, looks, handling \\rand a place to put your cargo. A Stylish Rocket! Have had the allroad about 4 months \\rnow. So far so good! Great styling, \\rperformance, handling and stopping \\rpower. Suspension a bit bouncy on rough \\rsurfaces, but manageable. Seems to be \\rbuilt like a Swiss watch, fit and \\rfinish is outstanding. Anxious to see \\rhow it does in snow (live in Colorado). \\rA real blast to drive in the mountains, \\rit really flies up the passes. Suspect \\rit will not do as well in snow as my \\rSubaru Outback, however, tires on Audi \\rare very wide. Turbo lag a definite \\rannoyance. Own one.  Now. The only complaint I have about the \\rcar - since I feel any review needs \\rsome type of criticism - is the lag in \\rthe Turbo. Compared to the A6 with the \\rsame engine, the allroad\\'s longer \\rdrivetrain and heavier body give the \\rengine a split second lag off the \\rline.  Once you get going, though, the \\rcar is peppy, and so much fun to \\rdrive. Allroad Great looks, many compliments.  Not \\rtoo many around so it has a great \\rappleal.  Excellent fit and finish.  \\rPoor full ecomony, but does have \\rfulltime 4 wheel  drive.  Very fast \\rpickup, but sensitive throttle.  I have \\rabout 10,000 miles on the car with \\rzero problems.  I really enjoy driving \\rthis car. Who needs an SUV Great car. Front end shake at 65-70mph \\rI understand is a common complaint \\rthese days. Design flaw in wheels. Snow \\rgets packed in them and causes the \\rwhole car to go out of balance and \\rshake. Other than these relatively \\rminor flaws, fast, fun, comfortable and \\rthe looks you get..Great Car. Understatement but not underpowered An evolutionary creature of my 99 A6  audi = porsche, without envy This is a wonderful car to drive. It is \\rfast, comfortable and easy to handle. \\rMy previous car was a BMW 633 csi. My \\rnew Audi may not be as flashy, but it \\ris every bit as fun to drive. Also it \\rdoesn\\'t evoke envy, which is a nice \\raspect since I live in a university \\rtown. The ultimate family vehicle There\\'s no need to have to give up \\rdriving enjoyment just because you need \\rto take the family along.  With a firm \\rsuspension, powerful twin-turbo engine \\rand 6 speed manual transmission, \\rdrivers who enjoy driving will \\rappreciate this car all the time (the \\rlag some people complain about only \\rhappens on the \\'tiptronic\\' auto\\rtrans versions), while the rest \\rof the family will enjoy the room, \\rcomfort and appearance of the best auto \\rinterior on the market.  Cargo and load \\rcapacity is great (better than most \\rSUVs)!  \\r There\\'s nothing else that combines the \\rpower, handling, luxury, carrying \\rcapacity, and real AWD capability - \\rESPECIALLY if you want a manual trans! I hope it doesn\\'t snow where you live I live in the mountains of Vermont. The \\rallroad has been an extreme \\rdisappointment here. You see, every \\rtime it snows the town puts down a \\rdirt/gravel/salt mixture that ultimatly \\rends up drying on the inside of the \\rwheels.  The allroad then shakes  \\rviolently at speeds as low as \\r20 MPH. Even Spring hasn\\'t ushered in \\rany relief from this problem.  A trip \\rdown my unpaved driveway replete with \\rmud puddles renders the wheels \\runbalanced.  My other two vehicles \\rdon\\'t have this problem and they don\\'t \\rhave Speed Vision infomercials touting \\rtheir \"go-anywhere\" versatility.  Avoid \\rthis car for use in snow country. Audi allroad Great alternative to an SUV. Great build Allroad Review I don\\'t need to say much but the \\rAllroad is great! I have had it for \\rabout a year and everything about it is \\rwonderful. Its 0-60 performance(6.8sec) \\ris wondeful, it\\'s handling is \\routstanding and its looks are perfect. \\rI took it up in the mountains and it \\reasily went through creeks and mud and \\rI love the fact how it rises up with \\rthe touch of a button. I did hesitate \\rbuying an Audi but I was convinced they \\rchanged(reliability wise) and that they \\rdid. Last I would like to say this car \\ris just not a Wagon it has Suv/wagon \\rappeal, Audi\\'s chrome affect looks, \\rPorschea handling, and a beatiful \\rinterior to fit. audi allroad Bought one of first in area. Love the \\rsix speed as it turns the wagon in to a \\rsports car. Excellent handling for such \\ra big car. Of course, wish the mileage \\rwas better, but we have averaged 20.3 \\rin 15000 miles, burning plus grade.\\r Used off road with pumps cranked up. \\rHandled rocks and ruts quite well.\\r Second Audi, the first being a 1996 A4. \\rCan not say enough about innovation and \\rquality (how far Audi has come in just \\ra few years!) Audi always has been \\rinnovative and now it has the quality \\rto boot., and is one of best marques on \\rroad, including BMW and Mercedes. great car have only had car for a week but am \\rextremely satisfied with it.  am also a \\rbmw owner and was skeptical reagrding \\raudi.  i could not have been more \\rwrong.  the car is powerful, tight, and \\rbuilt like fort knox.  i highly \\rreccomend this vehicle if you are \\rlooking for an all wheel drive wagon. Great Car EXCELLENT CAR, MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN \\rANY EUROPEAN WAGON. Who needs a truck? A great ride overall. This car has no major weaknesses, and a whole lot of strengths. Pros: Good looks and performance.  Great interior and overall comfort. Excellent handling and braking for such a heavy car (4200 lbs.)Adjustable suspension is great for trips on rough city roads, plus it\\'s cool when it auto-adjusts at a stoplight. Optional third seat in rear helps haul small kids around without taking up space for adults in back. Good build quality -- over 4K miles and no problems. And best of all, it\\'s not a truck!\\rCons: Fuel economy could be better.  A bit pricey, but you can pay more and get less for a truck! 2001 ALLROAD Elegant looks-inside and out. Very comfortable for long rides.  An absolute joy to drive.  Acceleration is very good (could be better with a V8) and handling is superb with minimum body lean, no tire squealing. Both elegant and practical Love my audi all road wagon - it handles well in all kinds of weather, and is fun to drive. I feel very safe when I am driving, no matter the conditions of the roads. Just about the best car I have ever owned Buy with confidence, it\\'s  a delight. It works as a car and as well as a wagon. Besides that it is one of the most attractive set of wheels on the road. Solid Replacement for the A4 Wagon Picking up an allroad slightly used was the only way we could find to replace our beloved 2007 A4 wagon.  We still have the wagon but since it has 146,000 miles we decided to \"leave\" the wagon to our daughter.  It\\'s a great replacement and is performing well.  The 8-speed transmission is butter (no, I did not mean better). Great mover Bought this car to replace a 2002 S6 because my wife really likes wagons. Moved our daughter from Humboldt over the weekend driving 14 hours straight. The wagon swallowed a ton on accumulated stuff, handled the twists and turns of highway 101 like a sports car and was a very comfortable cruiser on Interstate 5. The engine had plenty of power for passing but I had to use the paddle shifters because in drive mode the transmission kept the higher gear too long which made for a jerky  ride when you were trying to shoot the gaps. The sport mode shifted sooner but I didn\\'t want to pay the gas penalty.Overall it is a comfortable cruiser and 14 hours behind the wheel was not an issue. I highly recommend this car. All Road is Not All That Let\\'s start by saying this car (type) is the ideal car for me. Space for cargo--although not as much as one would think--car-like handling and great style. Audi builds great looking cars. My issues are with maintenance and driving performance. MAINTENANCE: had to replace tires, rotors and brake pads at 20,000 miles. Have a mystery rattle that was never found so the premium Audi came in handy to drown it out. Great sound system. DRIVING CHARACTER: Coming from an Avante, the driving characteristics of the All Road are not as refined or sporty. Little more body roll in corners and some squirlyness on imperfect roads. I would advise not buying with the upgraded 19\" wheels as they render the car useless in snow or conditions where Quattro will be functionally useful. Look good but compromise ride quality. Ask the 8-speed dual-cutch transmission is clunky at low speeds. Finally, Audi decontented the cars packaging from the avant. Many of the handy cubbies and drawers were taken away in this iteration of their wagon class. Ironic, considering it\\'s positioned as an activity vehicle. THE GOOD: The car does accelerate nicely when asked to and the fit and finish is really good. Cabin noise is very quiet. Looks great, alright the front end styling is a bit soft. Subjective. I\\'m stepping out of my All Road into the new Golf Soortwagon after looking at the BMW wagon--very pricey--the Volvo V60--no paddles on the R Design AWD--and stellar reviews on the Golf. It\\'s good all around, sans AWD, and is a great value. Papa Bill\\'s Allroad Excellent auto and the 2017 redo should be even better. All road fan  All around excellent vehicle I\\'ve had this vehicle for almost two years now and it\\'s been a very fun vehicle to drive!! I have the Prestige version and it\\'s fully loaded with blind spot monitor, rain sensing wipers, upgraded stereo. What I love most about it: Bang and Olufsen stereo..really sounds great, panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, power liftgate.What I don\\'t like about it: seats aren\\'t the most comfortable, and the rear seat leg room. Also the options can be $$$ when you move up in trim levels.Other than that, the Allroad is very fun to drive!Update: I sold this vehicle recently because minor problems kept happening and I was tired of taking it into the dealership.  The dealership near me is always busy and it\\'s hard to take my car in for a quick fix.   The bluetooth connection with my phone was always slow taking at least 5 minutes to connect and I had to wait for everything to \"initialize\" (including the radio).  The best thing about this car was the handling and power. MMI Disappointed that I am unable to upgrade the system; major flaw. Best bang for the buck (amazingly) in its segment I drove my smallroad from L.A. to Denver.  I went from 117F in Death Valley to 37F on Vail Pass, all in the same day.  The car had plenty of power cruising the straights of I-15.  I calculated my MPG during the trip, and it came out to 29mpg (rated 27mpg highway).  That\\'s including climbing from sea level up to CO.  I have the Sport Package with the Sport Seats, and they were very comfy for my 1000mile trip.  There\\'s all sorts of supports that you can change to make sure no single part of your body is aching from sitting in the same spot for too long.  I planned to break the trip up into two days, but I just love driving this thing too much, so I soldiered on through the night.  12noon to 5am.  Done and Done.  My only beef would be that while the xenon headlights are plenty bright, they might be aimed a little too low for me.  It was easy to overdrive them ;) ;) ;) There\\'s plenty of brightness to project further ahead, but not sure if it would result in blinding oncoming traffic or not.  The MMI with Sirius is a godsend on a roadtrip.  If you are in the market for a smallroad, get the updated version where the controls are near the center armrest and not on the center dash near where the radio is.  It\\'s so much easier to use that way. The Allroad makes sense... To begin with, I am a SUV refugee. I have lived in the Colorado mountains near Denver and got stuck driving SUV\\'s to have snow clearance so that my vehicle wouldn\\'t be turned into a snowplow at the wrong times. But I did need the space to haul road bicycles inside the vehicle in the summer during rainy weather along with baggage. Also needed power for climbing the mountains and good gas mileage for driving long distances without living in a gas station. This Allroad does it all with ease and style. This reminds me of my first Allroad of years past but this is truly a starship in comparison. Love this car and the handling is great compared to a SUV which is its true competition. Unbelievveable package The ride, look, performance, it is all there!  Audi hit a very HIGH point with this car and subsequent automobiles will be hard to out perform.  The RS 4 has 2 weak point that I will mention later but overall the car is REALLY sweet.  I used to own a M3 and this car (as a total package) outshines it in handling, daily driving and ICE (In-Car Entertainment).  Notables:  Brakes, V8 engine and exhaust note, crisp handling as well as balanced ride, short throw shifter and Quattro!  If you add an aftermarket exhaust (like my car has) it will make it sound like angry RS 4 (which is maybe the way it could have come from the factory). Total Package Great car. It really is a great package, sports car performance with room for 5. Though the rear seats are tight, there fine for my 3 younger children. Great performace, engine, brakes, handling, does all very well. I like the 08 M3 coupe, but it only seats 4, and the 08 M3 sedan looks too much like a plain 3 series. Audi hit a bulls eye with styling for a 4 door car. Bulging wheel flares remind me of a mid 1980\\'s 911 Turbo. Audi builds a great car, and the RS4 is a total package of performance, quality, and style. Bulletproof It is difficult to find any fault with this extremely well engineered car. Its DRC offers a very compliant ride when desired, but stiffens in the corners for confident handling in aggressive mode. The engine is superb and an aftermarket exhaust system (several are available) actually makes meaningfully more power. Its redline is 8250 rpm and it is a joy to drive with smoothly delivered power across the rpm range. Winter handling with winter tires is exceptional and the car is on rails in hard packed snow. The design is distinctive even compared to current model A4s. Perhaps the only thing that I would change is the seat height, which does not lower sufficiently for me (I am 6\\'). Great Car. Coming from an 2005 S4, my 07 RS4 is a completely different beast.  Has more power, much better suspension, looks better, feels better, just a better car and yes you pay for it.  However, I would like to see more power because people who buy RS4s crave power and 420hp just isn\\'t enough once you get used to it. An Amazing Car  I would have to say that this car is the most practical performance saloon on the market today. The amount of power you get from that 4.2litre V8 is astonishing. The handling far surpasses anything else in this range. Audis of old used to be really nose heavy and the understeer alot, but with this one you really have the confidence to shove it into the bends. I think this car is better than an M3. Sick, sick ride This car is just ridiculous! You can carry a family comfortably in it and still will blow ANYONE off the line. I had an S4 before this and it\\'s well worth the investment.  The best way to describe this car is an S4 on steroids. I haven\\'t had any problems with this car and didn\\'t have any with my S4 either. Take care of the car and it will take care of you for sure.  No one ever needs a car this fast, but why not have it anyway. I waited a year for this one This car is all that is \"cracked up\" to be; they put all their eggs into this automobile. It handles like a scapel and is so quick, that I have never had this kind of thrill. I have had an M3 and a 1997 911 and no car ever has delivered like this one. Worth the money and what you can expect to get in mileage with this kind of power. My favorite Audi so far. I\\'ve owned a total of 4 different Audis based on the A4 so far, a 1.8T, a 2.8, an S4 and now an RS4. Clearly, the RS4 is vastly superior to the earlier cars (surprise, surprise).  Huge fun to drive, awesome acceleration, outstanding handling & stopping power - at the same time comfortable, fine for everyday driving, it easily seats four people.  Still in lust with it after a year or so of owning it... a total sleeper... it doesn\\'t turn heads until you stomp it. Then - it moves. Perfect Car I have 6000 miles on my RS4 with no vibrations, no oil consumption, and no questions of build quality.  The car is just wonderful. Power is smooth and a lot of it there. I am averaging up to 25 MPG hwy @ avg speed of 79 MPH. I want my gas guzzler tax back! The car handles very well for a 4000 lb vehicle. The 60/40 front/rear Quattro bias is great. I have yet to feel front torque steer which I found quite often on my B6 S4. On the street/highway the car is perfect. On the track the DRC with the 400 lb spring rates is inadequate (Esses @ Infineon). The brakes are not meant for track use and the pad wear will be a problem. Replacement pads and rotors are not cheap.  Happiness is... RS4 Having previously owned an LS 400 Lexus, BMW 325 and the S4 2005 model, I find that the Audi RS4 without any doubt it is the most exciting and most comfortable car I\\'ve had the pleasure to drive. The interior design is exquisite and the aggressive exterior finishes this car superbly. Then of course there is the V8 4.2 FSI engine which tops it all with that \"purfect\" sound to go with it. A wee bit on the expensive side but I truly believe one gets what one pays  for with this unique car.  Beautiful!! I came out of an S4, and bought the RS4 after an ample test drive.  The driving dynamics and engine feel remind me of me 1997 M3 (first of three I owned), which I felt handled better than the 2001 and 2004 models I had.  It\\'s still a little nose heavy, but compared to the S4, it\\'s really hardly noticeable, and the braking, engine and lateral stability are outstanding.  Its really a wonderful machine, and the all wheel drive in the midwest makes it a near must.  If you are an M3 fan, you should really try this car before the next M3, especially if you are in the midwest or northeast.  Personally, even though its heavier, I couldn\\'t bring myself to give up the all wheel drive.  Try it and see. WOW! Don\\'t judge a book by its cover.  This is all race and high performance from the word go.  A small innocent looking button on the center console is marked with a green S ... it should come with a warning - \"no amateur drivers, professionals only!\"  This car is for the owner that appreciates and understands performance.  RS4 excellence in the road The best car I ever had, satisfaction for someone that has had the best cars, the mixture of performances in the RS4 make it the best car in its class Dream Car I just recently purchased the RS4 and every time that I just look at my car (which is often) I get a silly grin on my face and my heart starts to race. I remember feeling this way when I had my first love. Forget the performance of this car, there\\'s nothing out there in it\\'s class to dispute that. Some of my freinds said to me that I should go with something that stands out like an M3 but since I have had this car I have had several people comment on what an amazing looking car I had. The people that had to inspect the car for my title told me that they where fighting for the honor to test it! Power, comfort, ride, look, and an immaculate finish to everything in this car make the price well worth it Well-dressed Beast Undoubtedly the best sedan available.  The power and handling are awesome.  The gas mileage is better than an Audi S4.  The silver interior is breathtaking.  The voice control, navigation, and MMI are all very much intuitive (have yet to open the manuals with questions on any).  Everything is executed with class.  It\\'s not an inexpensive car, but it\\'s worth it. Worth all the hype I bought my car about 2 months ago. its been a pleasure to drive it everytime I get a chance. Its fast!, in control! a focal point on the road. You have all kinds of people waving you down begging you to hammer down on it so they can see it (for a few seconds at least) and get to hear it take off. I dont have the shaking of the steering wheel problem but my car has been consuming a lot of oil. Other than that the car is a lot of fun, and for what I get back, it\\'s worth way more than what I paid.The more you push on the gas, the more the engine calls for more. The \"S\" button is off the hook, it sounds great.  Flawless! This is by far the best overall sports car/sedan I\\'ve ever owned.  The car is incredibly quick, smooth and stable through all gears and under all conditions.  I dare say it\\'s even practical, with a huge trunk and ample back seats for kids.  Mileage isn\\'t the car\\'s strongest suit, but in context, given this car\\'s uber performance, it\\'s quite good (about 19 mpg under normal driving conditions).  Excellent interior and fit and finsish.  Audi did it right -- truly a great car. The fastest little 4 door with a HEMI The RS4 is sweet, its fast, it corners the best, and o\\' does it like fuel.  If you ever owned a S4 you must try the RS4.  It is so much better.  After 1500 miles I\\'m sold that this car is well worth the money.  However, I have 1 concern.  There is a vibration in steering column at 61 - 65 MPH.  The Audi engineers need to fix this quickly before it becomes a standard complaint about this most wounderful automobile.  Congratulations Audi... you have out done yourselves. The Best Car I Have Ever Owned The title sums it all up.  This is one great car!  You just can\\'t find this level of performance in a four-door, AWD, sports, sedan?  Read the glowing automotive press reviews and realize that they are not just hype.  The car is really that good.  Forget about the competition because this car blows them away. Wow is the only word I can say. The moment I turn on the engine... wow. Sounds so solid, I mean solid. Once you press the S button, it sounds even sweeter. Handling is fabulous, acceleration is top notch. Yes is a bit pricy but nothing compares at this moment so you pretty much have no choice. Best of All Worlds Yes, it is worth the money. Let\\'s get that out of the way first. The RS4 does everything my STi did, and more. Considering it costs twice as much as a STi/Evo, it had better do more, and it does. Much more comfortable and refined for daily commuting but when you get into the higher revs, it\\'s a beast. The exhaust note is amazing and there is so much torque at all rpms. Well balanced handling and it\\'s so much easier to drive quickly thru the hills. I\\'m even getting the same fuel economy as I was in the STi at 18mpg - 4 more cylinders, 120 more horsepower, just as fast and no increase in fuel consumption! Brilliant!  More then expected! My key concern when transitioning from a B5 500 hp S4 was the performance. Now after owning the car for about 1 month the performance is not my focus. The car is blazing fast. Yet Audi\\'s execution of everything else impressed the hell out of me. The car is so solid, smooth, and easy to drive everyday. I can\\'t say that about my old S4, it was getting tough! The car is much happier at 135 though, really smooth. Like it wants to do 190, it\\'s amazing. I strongly suggest the car to any modified S4 owner, they won\\'t want to go back to turbos.  Peerless I\\'ve owned the car for just about 6 weeks, and it\\'s been all fun.  There is no other car at this price that combines elite sportcar-level performance, 5-passenger capability, top-notch luxury features, 5-star safety, and all-wheel-drive. Astounded After multiple M3s and Porsches this car\\'s performance and construction astound me.  Brakes = surreal. I feel like I just begin to think about stopping and I am there, all without any complaint, squeal, or nose dip. Handling - I pull corners and I\\'m amazed the car transcends all its weight  and stays completely flat through the bends. The stick is the stick I had in my 911, that I was always trying to get in my M3s with trying different short shifter kits. Ergonomics - the way that everything is driver centered reminds me of my old BMWs.  Fit and finish, has attention to every detail that I felt was there in Porsche, but is lacking in most other cars. This is a four door car that has world class performance and the fit and finish that it does,  I don\\'t think that there is a better buy out there. Wish my steering wheel did not shake. Driving is great except for the shaking steering wheel at 61-64 mph. The performance on this is out of the world.  It must be more than 420 hp. Also the glove box opens by itself.  After driving 386 miles the oil warning light came on and I checked the oil which was 1.5 qts low.  So much for quality.  Does anyone have quality control?  Another RS4 at the dealership has the same vibration problem.  That is two out of three that shake. Hope the engineers can figure out how to fix this.  It would be bad if all steering wheels shook on this new Audi hotrod.     Perfect! This car is pure exhilaration.  It is extremely quick, hugs the corners and has a rock-solid build quality.  The engine sounds great, too.  This is a fantastic every-day car and not too thirsty given its 420 hp engine. Exhilarating! This car is nothing short of perfect.  It\\'s incredibly fast, grips the corners and has rock solid build quality.  This car is without compromise -- it\\'s a rockin\\' sports car with an ample back seat and a huge trunk.  I\\'m even getting decent gas mileage.  I love this car!   RS4 Cabrio is too much fun I have had my RS4 Cabrio for three months. I am astonished with the car: plenty of power, enough eye candy and the best attribute: I can cause BMW drivers to go crazy with the power I have under the hood. For me personally the best attribute about this car is that it\\'s not flashy and only Audi enthusiasts really know what sort of beast I am driving. I just wish I had more free time to drive it up and down Mullholland and there was not so much stop and go traffic here in LA.  Move over Carrera! As a 15 year Porsche Carrera owner most recently a 2005 C4S, I was sceptical on switching to an Audi. My biggest complaint with my C4S coupe was how noisy it was in the interior. I felt I had to compromise \"comfort\" for power. Not at all with the Audi Rs4!  It out performs my C4S and with it\\'s top down is quieter, too!! Hard to believe but true!  The Audi also offered bluetooth & ipod dock, which Porsche has yet to offer! I love this car!  It is so much fun to drive! It begs to go faster, which hopefully will not be near any law enforcement! Audi Should Just Bring This Car Back to the US My 2008 Audi RS4 with the available options has now turned 32,000 miles. The hardest part of owning this car during my 60 mile per day over a twisty highway is in keeping my speeds down.I put a K&N air filter in, and keep the S button pushed down and whether it is raining or dry, the handling, sounds, speed, control and Gallardo sourced brakes are incredible.This is a phenomenal car.Buy one if you want a Porsche GT3 with usable back seats, that in turn can be flattened out to create a cargo bay, or a place for your dogs to lay down on a trip.Unbelievable car! Awesome car! This is one of the greats, for sure. Classic lines, great build quality, amazing powertrain.  The engine always feels \\'on boil\\' and the transmission gearing matches the power band perfectly.  Great noises - I almost never turn on the radio with this engine and exhaust note filling the cabin. Still gets a lot of looks even though the B8 body style is out.  I\\'ll be keeping this one for a long time to come.  Best Audi Ever This is one of the Best cars out there, better than a BMW M3 or M5, Better than a Benz 63AMG.   I enjoyed Herb\\'s comments on this car, obviously he\\'s never driven an RS4 and must dislike Audi.  Anyone who compares this car to an EVO is, well, not well informed.  Best of luck to you Herb!!  LOL  There\\'s no car out that that can compare to this, it looks like a cute little kitty, but can tear your head right off.  Handling is out of this world and has a fully defeatable traction control which blows your mind. It is a rocket ship First, the Review by Herb posted earlier about this car...is complete nonsense. He clearly has NOT driven an RS4. Everyone that goes for a ride or drives this car...wants one! This is a monster in a business suit! It can rip 100mph quickly from stoplight to stoplight, if you are not careful. This car is about performance and handling with a lot of luxury. Any mention of an Evo or a Subi is ridiculous...this is not an A4 review. The suspension on the RS4 can turn 75-80mph on the highway exchange loop, yes I have done this several times. It performs that well! The car can be pushed farther than I am willing to push it.  Not Truly an \"R\" Car After owning 3 Evos, I really regret buying this car.  The gear box is very clunky and sounds frightening on cold shifts.  The acceleration is rather flaccid because of the low torque output. The brakes are mediocre and really upset the balance of the car on hard braking. The engine note is horrible.  On acceleration the engine makes an excruciatingly high pitched whining nose with no corresponding feeling of acceleration. The steering is terribly numb requiring constant adjustments in corners. Understeer is its preferred mode in corners. It also gets miserable gas mileage, on par with cars with bigger engines and more horsepower. The in-dash CD player went out within 500 miles. Audi RS4 I\\'ve had my RS4 for just over a year. The V8 is amazing. Put it in S mode and it gets scary. The suspension tightens and it sounds like you have a whole different engine in the car. The torque really shows its face when going uphill on the freeway. It just accelerates as if someone is feeding more horsepower. Very little sign of fatigue. It\\'s a heavy car but I like that. Built solid.  Such a joy to drive and own My RS4 continues to amaze me every time I take her for a drive.  Amazing in every way and especially when you consider what a wonderful daily driver the RS4 can be. I\\'ve been able to get 24.9 mpg when driving very conservatively. What other 400+ HP V8 car can you say that about?  My only complaint is the location of the parking brake with regard to the arm rest. Otherwise, perfect. Daily performance Overall, this car has been a pleasure to own. I previously owned an \\'04 S4 that still brought smiles to my face after four years. The RS4, however, really is a very different beast. The engine has a very distinctive character. Not only is the sound phenomenal but it just simply has more oomph throughout the rpm range. This is especially true above 5000rpm  where the tach rushes to redline. Living in the northeast, the car has been wonderful in snow and ice. It is easy to drive even with the \"S\" mode activated (I had read where this made smooth driving difficult, but I disagree). The ride can be harsh but is superior to the S4.  World performance car of the year I recently just purchased a 2008 Audi RS4 roughly 3 weeks ago and just absolutely love it! There is no road or track that this beast of a sedan can\\'t handle. Quattro all-wheel drive being implemented into this car is just fantastic. Driving up a road that was icy cars were unable to climp up that particular pass, I passed them with no trouble whatsoever and the looks on their faces were priceless. Wondering how in the world I managed to do it so easily. Nontheless it\\'s an everyday performance sedan that you can actually accommodate passengers in the back seat, yet alone have enough space for just about anything with an extensive amount of trunk space. Excellent car I purchased the 2008 RS4 in July 07 and took delivery toward the end of October 07. I have not yet had a good chance to put it to any serious tests. However, from what I can tell so far, it is an extraordinary car and has exceeded my expectations on most accounts. You\\'ll be amazed at how nice the car feels driving on mildly winding roads at 30-50 mph, and you\\'ll be equally as impressed with it\\'s ability to easily handle the same at 75mph. Acceleration is actually scary during the first week. All the other aspects you expect (the exhaust sound, the \"sticky\" 4wd, the short throw, the seats, etc.) are exactly as you\\'ll hope: perfect. Chose this over 335xi and M3, no regrets at all. 2008 RS4 Just picked up my 2008 RS4, Daytona Grey. Color is amazing The cars fit and finish, excellent. All  smiles fun factor. Handling excellent, comfort great, back seat is comfortable also but leg room in rear could be a bit more. Engine is amazing, Beautiful carbon under the hood and sounds great. Much more engaging than the new M5 or M3, from first hand experience. You never get bored. Plus confidence of Audi\\'s all wheel. Nothing like all wheel in the rain. I am very pleased. This blows your mind, The future next generation RS4 should even be better. Can\\'t wait. Not necessary but awesome Bought the car used and it’s been a great purchase.  Eye catching car.  Ridiculous performance for a sedan.  Not over the top ostentatious.  Classy power.  Solid build.  No issues.  Love it.    THE ONLY REVIEW YOU NEED TO READ! This car makes me want to work harder, so I never have to be without one.I ask my RS7 for permission to drive it.If Jerry McGuire had a RS7, Renee Zellweger would still be a single mom. RS7 amazing sports utility sedan Its easy to slide into the RS7 and become one with the machine.  Accessing the performance is effortless and the interior controls are seamlessly integrated and logical.  I don\\'t even have to think, things are where they should be.  Beautiful lines on the exterior, amazing utility with the interior cargo area makes this the most complete car I can imagine. It’s not an SUV! A4 allroad is a great combination of comfort, performance, and carrying capacity in an attractive, unique wagon. Great alternative to all the SUV’s out here. NIce Car, But! The 2018 A4 allroad has many positive qualities and I wanted to give it a higher rating but the high level of wind noise when driving it on the highway is the reason I gave it a low rating.  In addition to my own perception of excessive wind noise a passenger in the car recently commented that she thought that a window might be partially open.  I am surprised by the wind noise because several automotive journalists had commented that the allroad was a quiet car on the highway with little wind noise – like many car buyers I did a lot of online reading prior to pulling the trigger.  All of the door and window seals have been checked but the wind noise persists.  There was considerably less wind noise in my prior vehicle which was a mass market mid-sized sedan. Cannot wait for my \"Pocket Rocket\" to be delivered The 2018 All Road is gorgeous. I spent at least 15minutes rubbing my hand all over the exterior of the car. The lines, the design touches, it exuded quality beyond anything I have ever seen before. The interior, drop dead gorgeous. Perfect ergonomics. The leather, the dash board, simplicity raised beyond what most vehicles offer. Driving dynamics, silky smooth with 250 horses and a turbocharger at your command. An article in Consumer Reports in the spring of 2017 all but sealed the deal saying if you are going to buy a loaded Outback look at the All Road as in their opinion it was head and shoulder above the Sub. I am trading my 2011 Outback for the Audi. I had to order the Audi as I wanted a custom color and ventilated seats. I am like a little kid right know waiting for the Xmas presents to be found under the holiday tree. The thrill in Back! The A4 2.0Turbo, is a stealthy wagon often overlooked in the current market of SUV\\'s and crossovers. Fuel economy is great for a mid-size car, above average storage and sporty good looks. Positive stares and comments on a great looking automobile. Enjoy cruising for short road trips and and traveling to vineyards. The overall advantages of a Tesla fighter are evident except for no hybrid option. Audi is leading seller of stylish vehicles with great technology and safety features. We enjoy the front seat comfort, adjustable lumbar and leg bolster support. Very impressive speed from turbo, and with insulated windows low road noise. The 18\" wheels are low profile but give you a more tactical than cushy ride over bumps and potholes. This is THE car for people who like to travel Surprising fuel economy on the \\u200bhighway, comfortable ride in every condition. If you consider buying one of these you need to have the sport front seats and virtual cockpit. Quirky Ergodynamics Handsome car, Excellent Mileage, Great highway cruiser.   Good, not great, in snow with 4 new snow tires.  Ultimately poor ergo dynamics led us to sell the car at 8 months of ownership and 9500 miles.  Getting in and out of the car was difficult without hitting your head or shoulders.  Getting out of the car the back of legs would always hit the door sill trim which sticks out too much.  The gear shifter is different then standard automatics - easy enough to figure out but difficult if going from a different vehicle to this one.  Cupholders are in the worst possible location - under buttons.  Every time a cup is removed or placed in the holder a finger gets scraped.  The MMI (technology) buttons and knob are between the shifter and the cupholders.  One spill on the MMI controls and they are likely to get ruined and replacement costs are not covered by warranty (even the dealer warned us).  The radio volume control knob seems to be in a great place on the console but way too easy to hit with a bag - change the volume, turn off the volume.  The radio display - when a station is changed the display changes to the new station and then mysteriously shows the previous station (does not change the music) for about 10-15 seconds - why would it do that???  Strange click-click from under the car on the first acceleration with each time the car is turned on.  Dealer said it was the anti lock brakes (never heard that in previous cars with antilock brakes).  I wonder if it was the new quattro system. BEST ALLAROUND Pricey but well worth while. Car is an amazing combination of luxury, comfort and utility. It make you smile as you go down the road; however, it will NOT accept a trailer hitch even though articles say it does. Amazing Allroad This car is a joy to drive.  The composure and sure footedness is impressive at any speed.  Going a wee bit :) over the speed limit, you will not know how fast you are going.  Thank goodness for the head up display on the Prestige trim.  This is a silent and stealth car for those of us who are looking to do some spirited driving and get the children to school.  The quiet cabin is amazing as well.  Enjoying every drive! Dream car - very satisfied so far This car is by far the perfect fusion of performance, practicality and technology. Drive select gives you two different flavor of driving, dynamic being stiffer, comfort being softer, and it was more than capable when traveling through mountains or highways. More space than you possibly imagine, huge cargo, very comfortable second row (don\\'t look, sit on and you know what I am talking about). Length is the same with SUVs like Lexus RX 350, only with lower ride height, giving substantially better driving pleasure. Technology wise I don\\'t know a car better than this except tesla, definitely better than current BMW (2017). Combination of advanced lane assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist almost make this car driveless, removing most of driving pressure, but still in practical level (you have the control instead of the car itself). Luxury interior, fantastic lighting and high quality inlay and leather. Only one complaint is that it is not as sporty and stiff as some of the sport coupe, but I guess I can\\'t put all hope onto the same car:) Wagons are back! This is a fabulous car. Enough room to haul my dogs in crates. My 2006 Audi S6 just sits in the garage now. The turbo has no lag and the car is almost as quick and agile as my S6. Beautiful, but only to the eye.  This vehicle is very, very attractive. Mechanically it has been very disappointing. The engine is lame. I don\\'t need a power house but this engine is simply not eager. We\\'ve had many problems with this car, passenger seat jammed, engine light on consistently, front suspension issues, roof won\\'t open all the time, driver window regulator blew, fuel gauge inaccurate and fails, replaced fuel tank evaporator valve, seats squeak, replace engine seals due to oil leaks, water pump failed early, cigarette lighter doesn\\'t work, radio antennae mast failed, trunk lid struts failed and other minor irritants. The car isn\\'t as good a handling vehicle as my \\'97 BMW. Fuel economy isn\\'t stellar. Don\\'t buy 1! Great little car I have driven this car for several years and really have enjoyed it.  It runs well,  the top is easy to operate, and most importantly, it is reliable.  This car is distinct and well crafted, without a ton of bells and whistles.   I\\'m in love! I can only say great things about this car. It has been a sheer joy to drive and it looks incredibly beautiful. Good luck finding one! Be careful I love this car as far as ride and handling goes.  Fuel economy is not what I expected.  It has a tendency to be a money pit with regards to constant minor repairs.  The quality of the car leaves one baffled when you consider the association of the name.  Although, as I said I like the ride and handling, it is most doubtful that I would ever buy another one. Sweet Convertible Cruiser Bought this one owner Audi Cabriolet 2 years ago, drive it only in the summer (top has never been up ).  A real head turner, and always draws comments when parked.  V6 not powerful, no electric seats, no tilt steering, but fun as all hell to drive, no problems to date. Sad to see go The Audi cabriolet has been a fabulous \\rcar for me.  Very reliable, very zippy \\rand tons of fun.  As a petite woman, \\rit was the only covertible that I test \\rdrove where I had any visiability out \\rof the rear.  Have loved this cars for \\ryears and can\\'t recommend the model \\renough -- trunk space is minimal, but \\rso easy to dump things in the back \\rseat.  Happily, a relative is buying \\rthis car from me, otherwise, I \\rcouldn\\'t part with it.  I had three \\rpeople lined up who said, if you ever \\rsell, I will buy! yougottobekidding I like the power compared to my 2.5 TL \\rAcura ,it comes on soundlessly and over \\r60 has the pull of locomotive.Compared \\rto my sold miata it is not the best \\rhandeling but if a SUV (driver/phone \\ruser on wheels) decides to back end me \\rI won\\'t be flatted like a bug.\\rVery comfortable with top down and the \\rwindspoiler in place. Awesome car This car was given to me by my dad, \\rwho loves audis.  If you\\'re looking to \\rbuy a car with a good name and good \\rlooks, this is definently a great \\rpick! I haven\\'t had any problems with \\rit, though sometimes the automatic top \\ris stubborn. Timeless Car This car is now 6 years old, and still \\rdraws attention when it\\'s parked with \\rthe top down.  The design is absolutely \\rtimeless: it looks like it was carved \\rout of a single block of steel.  The \\r2.8 engine (Audi\\'s pre-5 valves per \\rcylinder model) with 170 horses will \\rnot rocket this heavy car off the line, \\rbut that\\'s not the point of the \\rCabriolet.  It\\'s a classic cruiser, and \\rit fills that role beautifully.  I will \\rkeep it 20 years. buyer beware I love the look of this car, but would \\rNEVER buy another Audi.  I had serious \\rproblems with many aspects of this car -\\rfor example, replaced the battery 3 \\rtimes in 4 years.  Had to replace the \\rentire steering system - and the car \\ronly has 46000 miles on it. Yvonne\\'s Good experience with this car!  no big \\rproblems and fun to drive.  I am \\rbecoming more concerned with safety,  \\rthus the convertible may not be a good \\rchoice for me anymore. Fun in the Sun This is a very solid vehicle. It has a nice ride and very low wind flow with the top down, thanks to excellent design and a helpful rear wind screen. A nice bonus is that you can take two extra riders in the back with you, either kids or small adults. Putting the top down is very simple. This has been a very reliable vehicle. A fantastic car I am in the UK, driving a UK spec 1.8 litre model. Not the quickest off the mark, but by no means slow; it keeps up with the high powered rivals and more recent cars quite easily. The handling is excellent, and although I have heard numerous reports of problems with scuttle shake, I\\'ve not experienced this. Some high repair bills, but apart from the clutch failing, it hasn\\'t ever broken down between standard services. Replacements as follows: clutch and flywheel at 80,000 miles, front suspension arms at 75,000 miles, brake discs and waterpump for coolant at 75,000 miles.   Audi Cab Fun car. Would prefer all-wheel drive \\rbut the front wheel is fine for \\ra \"summer\" car. Low noise with the top \\rdown, good sound system, excellent \\rmechanicals, very comfortable for \\rlarge driver. Could definitely use a \\rlittle more bhp but wonderful to \\rcruise New England in the summer.  Different Conv w/ great perf I have had my car for 5 years, and it \\rhas been so much fun.  The best part is \\rhaving a car that you don\\'t see every \\rday.  The backseat is bigger than the \\rBMW, the car is heavier than a station \\rwagon and hugs the road. Cabiolet 98 This vehicle has extensive problems \\rwith the electrical system throughout \\rits warranty period.  The dealership \\rwas consistently unable to difinitively \\rdiagnose the problem.  Since warranty \\rexpired (about 1 1/2 years ago)there \\rhas only been one episode... so perhaps \\rthey finally did fix the source of the \\rongoing problems.  \\rMaintenance is expensive on this \\rvehicle as should be expected and it is \\rnot easy to find a qualified mechanic \\routside the dealership, especially one \\rthat can accomodate my personal needs \\rfor convenience. Extended warantee? Fun car when the top will go down (all  2018 Q3: Sporty, Sleek, Classy Coupe I recently leased my 2018 Q3 about 2 months ago. I have the premium quattro 4dr in all-wheel-drive and I LOVE it! My 5 main pros are: elegant exterior and interior, amazing sunroof that I would expect on a much more expensive car, great lighting system, AMAZING safety features such as parking aids, sound alerts when you\\'re nearing objects, great safety ratings for collision safety, and an overall very smooth ride. There are a few little things I have noticed but they don\\'t really bother me which are: gas mileage could be a bit more efficient and sometimes the acceleration does feel a bit slow. Audi was having a leasing special on this model at the time and WITH tax my lease is about $360 monthly for a great car that does look and feel luxurious. I also want to say that I literally cannot tell the difference in size from the Q models from the outside. My Q3 looks the exact same to me as a Q5 that I\\'ll see on the road. I\\'m not sure why I\\'ve seen so many people comment that this is a small car, it is most definitely spacious. Especially since you can put the back seats down. I personally would never own a BMW so in comparison I\\'d take the Q3 over any similar models in the same price range any day. It\\'s a very sporty, cute little SUV that looks and feels really good (with a Sport mode that you can use if you want the car to feel especially sporty.) A P.O.S. in a shiny wrapper. I drove a 2018 Audi Q3 for 10-days as a rental on vacation. The vehicle had 8K miles and appeared to be of decent initial quality. This, however, quickly diminished. For reference, I own a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited and felt throughout my entire time driving the Audi that it was far inferior to the Outback in almost every way. Virtually every \"convenience\" in the Audi was difficult to use. The sunroof button has 5 \"positions\", two of which did nothing and the remaining three did not consistently work. The buttons on the steering wheel are completely useless, hardly any of which control any of the media electronics. The instrument panel has the speedometer, cruise control or a few other options in at least two locations, but there is no indicator for headlights. The interior door locks don\\'t work with the key removed. The keyfob unlock button wouldn\\'t consistently unlock all doors, wouldn\\'t unlock the rear hatch without using the actual trunk unlock button, and the car would relock shortly after unlocking making unlocking the car from a distance and then walking to the car without the keys frustrating as the doors would relock before reaching the car. The turning radius is horrible for a car so small. The braking system is extremely sensitive and while braking normally the vehicle would sporadically brake harder a few seconds into slowing the vehicle. The cockpit is a tight fit for me, being an extremely average 5\\'9\", 165lbs. The console is too wide, causing your leg to press against it while driving. Steering wheel and seat adjustment were impossible to get comfortable. The rear passenger space is quaint, not being able to fit two adults and one 12-year old or allowing any of them any legroom at all. The absolute worst experience with the Audi Q3 was driving from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles in 90+-degrees heat, slow- to stopped-traffic and a climate control malfunction rendering the air conditioning useless. The fan would audibly change settings but nothing came from any of the vents no matter how we tried to adjust settings. A few hours after reaching our destination, the climate control worked \"normally\". The only positive aspect of the Audi Q3 is that the engine does have decent \"power\" considering its small size, obviously from the turbocharger. But there is no way this car was getting 40-MPG that the trip computer was telling me. Overall, I feel the basic front-wheel-drive Audi Q3 is nowhere near the value of a similarly priced, fully-loaded all-wheel-drive Outback. A lot of the Audi felt cheap compared to the Subaru and I was extremely disappointed with the lack of quality as Audi is generally referred to as a high-quality, luxury brand. The Audi Q3 is an extremely overpriced piece of frustrating garbage. Not that I was considering purchasing a brand of vehicle other than Subaru, but if I were Audi would definitely NOT be an alternative brand I would look at. Great little CUV I have been in the market for a CUV and the Q3 is the one that won my heart. I have a Quattro Premium Plus with Sport Package and Navigation. It was the perfect size for me as I do not have any children, nor do I haul rear passengers often (Q5 was too big). Although my previous car (2016 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited) had a ton of advanced safety features, I found them rather annoying, nor did I ever use the adaptive cruise control. I also had a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited. It was part of the oil consumption class action suit. Burned oil higher than normal and dealer tried to say it was normal. In regards to Subaru and interior quality, I\\'ve been in several other car brands and Subaru\\'s is one of the worst. Also, don\\'t get me started on the dreadful CVT, wind and road noise Subaru has. The only thing pleasant about Subaru was the AWD system. So, I chose Audi because I know they also have one of the best AWD systems too. The Q3 handles well, has a high quality interior, as well as a quiet and comfortable ride. Although, not everything is perfect, there are some compromises. Acceleration and gas mileage is okay. But those are things I can overlook. Otherwise, this is a decent little CUV. Look forward to many road trips with it. A nicely powered crossover SUV Its higher end Excellent car  I had Benz 2010 many years and owned also the GLA 250 but AUDI Q3 much better, for the price, comfort, quality of material and reliability. Every car has pron and cons. Here are winning things in this car perfect size, quality of material, performance. Less noise than in GLA. Excellent navigation systems, Benz NAV is worse I ever seen. The best NAV only Land Rovers have. Panoramic roof very good. Limitations are can’t figure out how garage opener works, it has buttons but I was not able figure out. The wheel I’m not so happy in sport model for that however regular model excellent. Gas mileage are okay, the best was in GLA honestly. But that it, so I give 4 stars for Audi Q3 and recommend this car.  A Converted Lexus User Have been a Lexus user for 20 years but the Q3 was the car that convinced me to change over.  Great performance and safety. Fun car to drive.  The one negative is there is no Homelink for garage door so have to use a clicker which is 30 year old technology.  That was disappointing. Didn\\'t find that out until after I bought the car.  Audi needs to change that and be upfront it currently does not have it. 2017 Audi Q3 Premium Plus FWD (front wheel drive) I used to own an Audi A4 ten years ago so decided to sell my noisy Volvo and go back to Audi. I wanted a small SUV this time with all the bells and whistles. The dealer had a loaded AWD that we drove. I was impressed with the way it handled and drove. Living in Florida, I figured a front wheel drive would be enough for us, so we ordered a FWD Premium Plus. After delivery and driving it several times, I felt like it was not like the car we drove at the dealer. It was sluggish and hesitated at stop lights and the shift points seemed off.  I made an appointment at around 2500 miles to have it checked out. No problems were found; the Audi tech said he wanted to explain something that we may not have known when we ordered the SUV. He said the AWD and FWD have different transmissions and the AWD is more spirited and reacts when stepping on the gas, whereas the FWD is more economy minded. A light went off in my head  that answered my nagging question. Now, I have a one year old Audi Q3 that I don\\'t find fun to drive anymore. I\\'m waiting for the 2019 Q3 and Q4 models to come out, but in the mean time, Consumer Reports Magazine just put the new 2018 BMW X3 at the top of the list for compact SUV\\'s. I plan to go test drive it soon. Highly recommended compact SUV I’ve been a long-time Audi owner (A6, TT, A4) so it seemed pretty straight-forward to try out the Audi line when we were ready to replace our SUV. I had been eagerly awaiting the US release of the Q3 after researching it from afar. Before buying, I drove the Q7 and Q5 for comparison. Both beautiful cars, but we were looking for something compact. I give the Q3 5-stars in every category but acceleration, control logic, and road noise. The acceleration is fine, just a little less gutsy than some of the Audis I’ve fricen before. The control logic is great, except for the sound system control. They’ve moved it from the main center console to the center dash console. (Edit: after driving the vehicle for 8 months I no longer notice the difference) Road noise in an SUV is almost always going to be heard, add in winter tires on weathered roads and it’s pretty much impossible to keep it quiet. Not too bad, considering. Everything else has been exactly what I have come to expect from an Audi. Great Car Would Buy Again!! This is a great car got it when my son was 5 now he is learning to drive with it. The cost to own is a little higher than say, a Nissan, but you are getting your money\\'s worth with this purchase. I would definatley buy this car again. The perfect \"wife car\"! I got this car for my wife, it\\'s her 2nd Q3. Previously she had the premium plus fwd. Honestly if you compare it to the average small SUV out there, this thing is absolutely fantastic. She loves how it looks, it drives better than competitors due to the Audi Quattro. There is nothing like a Quattro Audi, I drive one myself as well and even if you don\\'t get snow it\\'s really nice the way it handles the road. The main thing about the Q3? It listens to the driver. Go try the x3 or the x1 or the lexus rx: they\\'re great cars but they have a mind of their own. The other thing is that we got an amazing deal thanks to Edmunds forums. I found out the residuals and the money rate, I followed advice on how to shop and I got a really great deal. It\\'s a premium plus with the sport plus trim, which makes it look even nicer than stock. Anyways, we love our Audis and as long as I can afford to drive them I will. When I can\\'t I\\'ll switch to VW. 11 months in a fantastic little car, Audi 2017 Q3 Yes, this car could have used 50 more horsepower in the 2.0T model, however the highway mileage is a sensational 33mpg at 65mph (with 89 octane fuel)     It has a nice tight suspension with a super quiet ride. I was looking for a car for 2 years prior to buying this Q3 and am very pleased.   It has taken me from Key West to the mountains of Northern Maine in a confident, safe and secure way.    The down sides:  Be aware that the display is in desperate need of upgrading, the Pirelli brand of tire needs to be changed to Michelin. Wish I kept my base model 2011 Maxima I have never had a car payment until I purchased this car and I was more than happy to pay the large monthly payment when I considered all the \"upgrades\" and the luxury of driving an Audi.  I have had nothing much tech/mechanical issues since the day I bought the car. Overall it is a very nice car. Its stylish, it\\'s okay on pick up (but nothing like the Maxima) the interior styling is very nice and the trunk/folding down rear seats are why I mostly wanted to upgrade to an SUV. However, the minor down sides eventually became so irritating I traded it in for a BMW Gran Turismo. The windows constantly needed the \"pinch sensor\" reset. which means my windows would roll up and then immediately roll back down. This happened 4x. I would need to call and either talk through it with a tech over the phone or drop it off for reset. My BLUEtooth never worked properly. Heaven forbid I answer a call while my 3rd party player was streaming music.... after the call ended I would have to reset the bluetooth system and again maybe play 2 songs before it randomly disconnected. My AC stopped working 7 months into owning the car. ( that was the last straw) The car is very nice, but it didn\\'t wow me. Even aside from the minor issues....the tech package is bland at best. Certainly nothing I wouldn\\'t expect in any other brand, luxury or not. Just did not live up to the luxury I expected from an Audi. Nice car Does not have a touch screen! Excellent Value, Great Car First of all, I have owned a lot of cars. But, I think I found the one. I bought this car four months ago. I have the premium plus. So here is what I like: I love the feel of a luxury car. When I close the door, I feel closed off from the outside and it is VERY quiet, I like that. I love the leather, the style and the look of the car. The instrument panel is really nice. It\\'s easy to understand and easy to operate. What I was really surprised about is the power and the handling of the car. It has more power than I am use too. That is not something I really look for in a car, but this one has it and I find that I really like it. Audi Q3 great fit for working mom Great if you need a smaller SUV, with style and luxury. I thought this would be a very safe car but NO!!! I just bought a brand new car for two months and only drive it for about 500 miles. The car unexpectedly started to shake and then flameout during the drive, I tried to restart the car but the engine light turned on so I had to pull to the side of the road and will ask road assistant to tow it to the dealer one week later. The Q3 is pretty outside and inside, I used to like it very much but now I regret to buy it. This car is totally unsafe and not reliable. What if this happened on the highway. Additionally, when I drive the car I feel the transmission didn\\'t change smoothly. I can clearly feel a \"break\" when I release the gas pedal slightly. This is really a lemon car! I used to have a Volkswagon beetle and had really bad experience with it but now the new Audi has the similar issue. Very disappointed. 2017 Audi Q3 Just purchased a brand new 2017 Audi q3. After two week\\'s of having it and driving just under 300 miles the car is already back at Audi to get the engine worked on.. My wife was driving home from work when it started to shack uncontrollably causing her to pull to the side of the road. Thank god she wasn\\'t on the highway at the time.  The car would not move without shacking. The car was towed to the for them to fix. The dealership was helpful and apologized of course. Never the less I find this completey unacceptable given the fact the we have to go threw this with a brand new car. Love the look of both inside and out but so far has not been reliable. Small is where it is at Owned this SUV for 2 years now.  A great little SUV we use mostly for weekend and trips.  It is perfect for us now than the kids have all gone away. Plenty of space for the 2 of us.   It has performed well and we have had no issue with it since the purchase.  The only issue I have is with the transmission and all the shifting especially when the vehicle is cold.  Once it gets going it can hold the speed with the best of them and it is very nimble on the road.  I also like the NAV system, and the audio system, very well done, simple and stylish.  The interior is very comfortable even after a 10 hour drive. Luckily it has a good warranty This car has been in service for back up camera failure, intake manifold failure, improper reattachment of a gas line by the service staff (scary) and today the engine light went on for some sort of electronic engine failure yet to be determined.  I have only owned the car for 24 months but am ready to sell and buy something I can count on.  In addition, there are many features that are missing that are offered by many luxury competitors such as homelink and the ability to set power seat positions for each driver.  The nav system is awesome and you can link your calendar to send it to the car for appointments.  However, the cool tech does not make up for the poor reliability.  It does not even come close. 2015 Q3 Quattro - Engine light keeps going on If you don\\'t mind spending your days at the service shop... I do, it\\'s very inconvenient. I only have 20,000 miles.  I\\'m told there are no guarantees the engine light won\\'t go on again at any time since this is what happens with all electronic systems with all cars. Luckily, I didn\\'t have these problems with my BMW, Mercedes or Infinity. Oh, the service repair shop could care less about any inconveniences and will not give loaner cars. Best SUV for My Wife The Q3 is a perfect size SUV for my wife. We feel it is a very comfortable, safe, solid, and fun-to-drive car. We both like to drive this SUV than the other SUV, Lexis RX400. We feel more confidence and safe to drive Q3 than RX400.  Q3 inside design is very logic and convenient.  The SUV also has a great mileage on highway, we get 32 mpg at speed of 68 miles/hour.  The assistant driving and assistant parking options are very useful, especially for seniors. Great value for the Price We really like this vehicle. The handling and performance is great. I had read that the Q3 did not have the performance that the Audi line up has. It has great acceleration and braking. I am not looking for a 700 horsepower engine , I just want to be able to get good acceleration. The scrolls for all the lists seem to be backwards and the placement of the controls is not the best forcing you to look way down when using them. The MMI package is difficult to set up needing to get on the web and sign up and then putting in other information on the car. we like the interior and are happy with the space ( I have heard complaints that the storage was small we bought a smaller SUV and expect the space. I have driven an RDX, Buick Encore, the Lexus NX and the BMW X3 and like the Q3 better than these vehicles. Perfect auto for my wife.. this auto is great. i had forgot about the german engineering.  (had 2004 z4).we replaced  an acura rdx. New style v-6 (Japan) I cant believe someone only gets 17 mpg.on the average mine is 4 mpg better than the rdx. way better ride than the rdx.The q3 is about 1\\' shorter than rdx. Love my q3 This is a perfect size small suv. I love it I\\'m so glad they came out with this model. I get so many compliments on my white q3. It is vert comfy and drives great. Great on gas too.highly recommend this car. Love car exelent car for all time Enjoyed my Q3 for 3 years. Love it. I have been very pleased with the Q3.  It does everything I want so I have only good things to say. After 3 years, this car is still a pleasure to drive.  It still feels, handles and rides like a new car.  It also has a substantial large car feel without being cumbersome. Would buy another when time comes. Purchased April 2015. Not Happy with this SUV I bought this SUV thinking I am getting a good deal but I am not happy with what I got.  I paid extra for the Navigation package and I assumed it would be touch screen.  I mean why would any car manufacturer make in dash system which is not touch screen in this day and age.  It sucks to enter a phone number using the inbuilt dial.  The entire system is so cumbersome.  It seems AUDI has really skimped on this model.  No way to fold side mirrors and no homelink either.  I am not sure what else is this model missing but I very skeptical about what AUDI had put in this model.  I will most likely trade in this vehicle for something else. This is my first and last Audi. The worst fuel consumption by far for similar cars I Had the 2015 Q3 premium for 6 months now and so far  I realy don\\'t like it ... I had a VW 2012 tiguan Previous to this car and I miss it very much !!! Wonderful car but no Homelink We bought this car and love it.  Great traction in the snow and quite happy with it.  However their is no Homelink so if you want to sync it with your garage door it does not exist.  How many high end cars don\\'t have this option?  We hear the company might retro fit this into the car.  We will see and if they do it for cars already purchased.   Just got it and it\\'s great so far We already have a full size SUV and found that 90% of the time we are just pulling around an empty trunk and hundreds of pound of extra weight.  There was no purpose in driving that thing for the majority of our needs.  So we got the Q3.  It gives the SUV feel but you aren\\'t towing around all this weight and space that rarely gets used.  The trunk is more than big enough for grocery trips.  If you take out the covers on the trunk space and the door you can fit a lot more than you might have expected.  We just brought home 8 27 gallon storage bins from homedepot with room to space.  I wasn\\'t sure they would fit in the trunk when we bought em.  It has plenty of room in the back for carseats. The Q3 had me at hello. After driving a sedan for the past few years, I was eager to to find a small SUV with sporty handling and all the bells and whistles.  I did a LOT of research and considered Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, Lexus NX, BMW X1, MB GLA, and a number of others that were ruled out long before test drive time, either due to appearance, quality or feature combinations.  Long story short, the Q3 won my heart on the test drive.  It sailed easily over potholes, twists and turns, and accelerated nicely onto the freeway.  I love how it rides, handles and brakes.  It has enough cargo space for my needs.  It\\'s so fun to drive.  The experience at the dealer was great as well.   The Cure for the Common SUV What a vehicle.  Has all the comfort and toys you would expect in a vehicle.  Very Comfortable, Agile,\\rSharp, Excellent finishes, Fun to drive, Its the perfect size for those not having to haul a lot of things or people but yet enough room to fit more than a car.  You get the elevated height and of course the best AWD drive system out there, Quattro.  The Q3 was well worth the wait. Comfortable solid sporty fun-to-drive Safety features are lacking, interior comfort is good for the driver and passenger.  The second row passengers are a little cramped.  The drive is very comfortable but not what I would call zippy from a complete stop.  The navigation media center is lacking.  I wish this vehicle had Apple CarPlay.  The back hatch has adequate storage for luggage for two on a long trip.  Of course, if it was just two in the care, you could fold down the back seats for significantly more storage.  I leased this car and I am considering buying it at the end of the lease or trading it in for a newer version.  Price includes Tech Package and Perma Plate. Best visibility if you are height challenged The Q3, in my opinion, drives much better than the A3. To Vermont and back to Texas Well you can say what you want about the limitations of the Q3, on the whole the vehicle is a fine machine. My 2016 Q3 has now 21,150 miles on it and has not missed a beat. Recently drove from Houston, Texas to Fair Haven, Vermont and back in ten days; it was a great experience from start to finish. The Q3 met every challenge along the way averaging 32.5 mph at posted speeds. Handled great, avoiding two possible truck encounters and a Northeaster that dumped 24 inches on us in Vermont.  The all wheel option did well in the snow as well as in the rain and ice.  Heated seats came in handy in 5 degree weather while the heated side mirrors made it easy to drive in the blowing snow conditions. A USB port would be nice but the Bluetooth option for Pandora and Audible made the trip a fun experience.  If you want a good value with multiple option plus good mileage, the Q3 is an SUV worth considering.Now a few more miles down the road and still enjoying my ride. On short coming is the lack of “gritty-up” to enter feeder lanes for our Texas highways; 50 more horse power would make a difference, then again Texas drivers love to go 80 in a 70 while staying on your bumper might have more to do with the sense you may be in somebody’s way creating that “need for speed”. I have 12 months left on my lease and probably will move up to a Q5 on the next go around. Something a little bigger and a better power to weight ratio. One year out and still enjoying my Q3 I purchased my 2016 Prestige Q3  quattro with the Sport Package in Nov 2015 and love this SUV. I surprised myself when I bought this since I wasn’t looking for a “luxury” SUV. However, I had shopped for over a year and drove virtually every other SUV in its’ class and was just not impressed with the drive and handling (or sound systems) of the Q3’s competitors. I love how this SUV handles on winding roads and love driving it so much I look for excuses to take it out! I’ve read several reviews suggesting the Q3 may have below average acceleration and power but have not found this to be the case at all, even with passengers in the car. To me it’s like driving a sports car with an awesome sound system. Some blogs suggest you can purchase a Sprint Booster module for even faster acceleration but I don’t feel I need it. There is no lag in acceleration when I hit the gas unlike other SUVs in its’ class that I have test driven. I’ve only needed to take in for service for the first oil change/checkup; its\\' basically been flawless since I bought it over a year ago.Update on 1/5/18. Over 2 years out and still loving my Q3. Perhaps the most important update I can give is that after all this time (closing in on 25K miles) I have had zero issues with my Q3. Hence, the quality of Audi\\'s vehicles has held up in my case. I\\'ve also seen where Edmonds reviews lists sluggish performance and handling as negatives for the Q3. I can\\'t speak for later models but I\\'m still very happy with the peppy acceleration on my Q3 and strongly disagree with the handling point. My Q3 is a dream to drive and handles extremely well on winding and downhill roads. This was a major selling point for me after driving many other SUVS. Breaking is also smooth and dependable. The infotainment system is admittedly dated (but has worked just fine) and gas mileage could be better (though has been slightly better than advertised in my case), however, these were not my highest priorities when purchasing my Q3. My advise is to test drive a Q3 if your looking to by a compact SUV and not go strictly by the reviews. The best car I have owned, truly This is my first Audi, but I have had several VWs and they are the same \"family\".  I have owned it 6 months.  It is nimble, handles the road well and it accelerates well when I need it to.  I love back country roads with hills and corners and would call this a \"driver\\'s car\".  If you enjoy driving, this is great for that and driving is not boring.  I already used the word nimble, but I emphasize this word here as it makes me smile and I often think \"I am one with the car\" when I drive this.  I drove in ice and snow with it for the first time earlier this week.  These were bad conditions and a 45 minute drive took me 2 1/2 hours and my Audi handled it like a champ, truly.  Other cars were spun off to the side and this vehicle stayed on track (of course I drive according to the conditions) and my car simply did it well.  As for complaints, I would say that being able to change songs on my MP3 or change stations on my radio ought to be on the steering wheel vs. the dash.  I also am waiting for my first oil change (soon) to have them do something to update my GPS maps as this car doesn\\'t \"get\" newer construction and simply thinks I\\'m off-road at times.  But, aside from that, it is a joy to own and drive, so very quiet and I have to also say that not a week goes by without a stranger telling me it is \"so pretty\" and complimenting it.  Someone helped me out of a store with something heavy not long ago and stopped in their tracks and stated \"You have my dream car!\" and I did enjoy that.  Something is awfully fun about having people making a remark regularly about how nice the car is, I admit that.  I have never felt compelled to write a review before of any car I have owned, but I love this so much that I decided that I needed to share.  It is simply just a happy vehicle for me to own, I like happy!Updated, at Edmunds request at a few weeks less than one year of ownership:  I still love the car.  I\\'m still as happy as I was before.  It is a great vehicle and it is all the things I said previously.  I\\'ve not got about 18,000 miles on it.  People literally stop me in parking lots or gas stations to tell me what a pretty car it is, and I still love that.  I had an incident with the car where I avoided hitting a dog in the road (sadly it was running free) and hit a curb and destroyed a tire.  It needed a front end alignment after that.  Everything is fine, the vehicle handled an incident like that well and I was quickly able to adjust my driving and avoid hitting something.  It brakes well, handles well, does it all.As stated previously, my only less than perfect rating is the technology.  The radio is sluggish when you try to surf stations, not being able to change stations using the steering wheel is a negative on long rides.  The sound is good.  The GPS is \"old school\" and not a touch screen and it sometimes doesn\\'t know where it is, forget trying the voice commands as it never gets what you say, even if it is said clearly.  An update of that would be $420 dollars at the dealership, so no thanks on that.  I have a previously purchased Garmin in the car and will use that for long trips at the same time as the navigation in this car as I now do not trust it.  One time I was in the car driving in Rhode Island and it literally placed my car out in the ocean rather than on the route.  That was truly bizarre.  Yet, 95% of the time it works just fine.  I need dependability for appointments and trips, so hence the need to have the Garmin on hand. Great ride - lovely interior - a few glitches Very happy with the car in general.  We use it both here in suburbia, and in our trips up the mountain to our home there.  For a 4-cylinder, performs well, with good acceleration and an extremely smooth ride.  The handling is amazing - like a sports car.  With the leather interior the cars smells so good!  :-)  The trunk is small-ish, so if you have kids maybe this is not the car for you - consider the Q5.  But it holds a LOT with the rear seats down if you have to haul something.  Minor quirk - I would have liked the adjustable steering column to have more adjustment down, as it sits a little high for me, even as a 6 foot driver.    Mileage:   On the highway, the indicator shows about 32 MPG - not bad.  But actual measurement is about 29 on the highway - surely a modern 4-cylinder can do better! Audi Q3 rides like a NYC taxi! After a year the shock absorbers are basically dead. You drive an Audi and it feels like a NYC taxi! I just did the 15k service at Audi But they claim the car is fine. Clearly there is an issue with this Q3. Buyer beware!! Audi does it again! Love the performance and the connection to the road, the logical interior layout and equipment without stupid extras . My biggest criticism is the height of the media/nav window that you cannot get rid of- cannot fold down or black out. I am 5\\' talk and it is right at eye level and VERY distracting to drive with, more so at night! If I cannot get used to it... It might make me reconsider the car- which I LOVE on every other level!!! Safety crash tests I am shopping for a Q3 or Tiguan or Jeep Cherokee. The Vw and Jeep show 5 star crash and safety ratings on stickers but I have not been able to find these test results on the Q3. I own a W Q5 and the rating is available What Gives Wudi Don\\'t waste your money! This 2016, Audi Q-3, Prestige Quattro, is a nice design. PROS: The colors are great both Inside (chestnut brown leather) and Out (cuvée silver metallic). The car holds the road firmly and has a good ride. The steering is crisp and the breaking is excellent.  Headlights are awesome when driving at night on unlit roadways.  Seats are fairly comfortable with the Sport Package that was included as an option.  However, not nearly as comfortable as the seats in an A-4.  Sight lines out of the car are great.CONS: the electronics (Nav, phone, Wi-Fi) are a little difficult to get used to, but can be handled with some practice. Heated seats take forever to warm up.  Rear view camera takes too long to turn off after shifting back to a forward gear.  The only engine available for this car, 2.0 L / 4 cylinder / TFSI, that produces 200 hp & 207 ft-lb torque, is minimally enough for the car. And that\\'s with just me as the driver.  If I had 3 other adult passengers in the car with me, the engine would struggle even more to get the car moving. The 6 speed transmission seems to do a good job, but could certainly use more support from the engine.  And, driving the car in the \"S\" gear to get the engine more power, forget about it!  The gas mileage would be terrible for a 4 cylinder engine.I think the worst part is that this same 2.0 L engine with 6 speed transmission is used in several other Audi models. But, they have way more hp and engine torque and even get way better gas mileage.  Unfortunately, this car/crossover/ SUV paired with this weak engine does not live up to the standards set by this brand\\'s other proven models.   Quite the let down! Right size, right price, good dealer support This is not a GTO! But, it\\'s perfect for my wife who wants a very safe car with blind side warning, 4 wheel drive for a snowy Boston area uphill driveway and comfortable seating. Just the right hight to get in and out easily and still sit up a bit so you can see. The back seat is cozy, but easily handles two grandkids. Very quiet interior (compared to a Camry): all the technology requires re-education, but it works well. Not sure about maintenance costs, but initial reports are good and frequency of oil changes and the like are every 10,000 to 15,000 miles after a dealer paid 5,000 mile =checkup 2016 Q3 Prestige with Sport Package I recently took my wife\\'s 2011 Q5 in for routine service, and the dealer gave me the Q3 as a loaner car. I was very impressed with the ride versus my 2011 A3 TDI. So when I went back to pick up my wife\\'s car, I decided to sit down with a salesperson to discuss the possibility of trading in my A3. The deals they were offering were excellent, and I just wasn\\'t willing to wait to see how Audi was going to resolve the emission issue affecting the 2.0 TDI engines.So far, I\\'m extremely happy with my decision. The Q3 with Prestige and Sport Packages is a real step up from my 2011 A3 TDI. The ride is extremely comfortable and the cabin is incredibly quiet. Incidentally, on previous occasions, I also had the opportunity to drive the 2015 A3 Sedan for an extended period as a loaner car, and the Q3 feels a lot nicer to drive. The handling with the 19\" tires included with the Sport Package is really impressive. It doesn\\'t handle like an SUV at all. The car accelerates very evenly and the transmission shifts very smoothly. The exterior and all of the interior finishes are just beautiful! The Bose Audio system included with the Prestige Package sounds great, and I love how seamlessly my iPhone connects (via Bluetooth) to play all of my audio files. My only disappointment is the relatively poor fuel economy for an SUV in this class. In fact, the fuel economy is essentially the same as my wife\\'s Q5 which is significantly larger and heavier. It\\'s especially painful because I was averaging nearly 42 miles/gallon with my A3 TDI. However, it\\'s unclear whether or not these fuel economy figures would have been impacted by whatever solution Audi/Volkswagen comes up with to meet the emission requirements.For me, it\\'s the perfect compromise of size, comfort, quality, and luxury. I also considered the BMW X1 and the Mercedes GLA, but these two alternatives were significantly more expensive when comparably equipped. The Q3 is really an excellent value and I\\'m looking forward to years of driving this exceptional vehicle. VERY happy so far! Have had my Q3 for a month and am very pleased so far with the way it handles, how comfortable it is (got the sport package), and how smooth the car rides on Colorado\\'s poorly maintained roads. Love the auto climate control and the cargo area is big enough for my bike which is why I wanted a crossover. It\\'s fabulous and zippy on steep, curvy mountain roads. I\\'m averaging 24.5 mpg with combo city/highway (mostly city) driving. My only challenge is figuring out all the computer programs in the car and setting everything up to my preferences. The car manual has become my lifeline and I have to reference it often as it\\'s a bit complex. The cruise control/radio/navigation/windshield wiper/etc. controls are pretty easy to access from the steering column but I find that I hit the wrong controls occasionally because everything is in one place. Huge learning curve with the car ( but then, my old car was a 2004 so I\\'m behind the times for car technology) but I have to say I\\'m very, very happy with it. A-6 replacement Got the Q-3 when my A-6 expired after 195,000 miles.  From my perspective its a great replacement.  Interior feels like an Audi - has space for my family of 4, but it cost less to insure, less to fill with gas, and cost a lot less than a new A-6.  My mother-in-law really likes the Q-3 because it is just the right height for  getting into and out of - the A-6 was too low and my wife\\'s Land Rover Disco was too high. Very high quality performance sedan. Just bought a used 2012 Prestige. It\\'s really nice inside and it drives super nice. I am used to Audi/VW 4-banger engines so the gas mileage isn\\'t as good. But it handles and goes a lot faster than any of my previous cars.  It\\'s a true high performance luxury sedan. Just hope I don\\'t get any big repair bills. 2012 A6 w/ EPL...Giddy-UP! I\\'ve owned my fairly low mile 2012 a6 for about a year now and I could not be happier. I\\'ve added a little zip to the car with an EPL tune + pulley that gives it another 80-100 hp from stock. I\\'d advise anyone that likes an extra sporty ride with no downside to get this tune....Amazing!!  Back to the car. Love the drive. The quattro has an incredible feel of safety. Rides on rails for a luxury sports sedan. I don\\'t have the air suspension so highway driving is a breeze but chippy roads can get a little rough, especially with 20 inch wheels. A6\\'s have a touch more body roll than I thought they would have but it\\'s not an S so it makes perfect sense. Interior is excellent. Seats are very comfortable. Heated seats work great but no cooled vented seats in my ride, which I really miss. Air con. is great though. Once you get used to MMI it\\'s so easy to navigate. Speaking of navigate, the live google navigation is very nice to have at your fingertips. GAS Mileage you ask?...even with tune,  30mpg on highway at 65-70mph (26mpg on highway @ 85mph). City is around 20. Steering is a touch vague but extremely confidence inspiring. All in all the car is fantastic. I\\'ve owned an e39 M5, S55 AMG with tune (rocket), CTS-V, G35 and way way back an Integra GS-R (totally stock). I think for all around sporty driving and comfort for a family of 5, this one is my favorite of all. It obviously has more tech but the feel of safety and road holding is just amazing. It\\'s just so easy to drive!    For pure driving fun the e39 was probably the cream of the crop. Although the A6 w tune is a good bit fast than the M. So much for the money... Always find an after-market shop for repairs. NEVER go to an Audi Dealer, unless you have no other choice. In my case this is $85/hr for a very good after-market shop vs $155/hr at the dealer. I recently retired my 2000 A6 Bi-turbo with 424k miles. Anyone who says Audis don\\'t stand up over time is talking rubbish. But at such mileage almost any luxury vehicle is going to nickel and dime you. Thus, my move to the 2012 A6 Prestige.The 2012 A6 is a differently beast entirely than the 2000 A6 it replaces. Longer wheel base, wider. The supercharged 3.0  feels distinctly different than the bi-turbo 2.7, and with a re-mapping of the ECU (APR), The engine makes 400hp vs the 310 it has in stock dress. An older driver, I\\'ve always been a \\'car guy\\', though my priorities have changed somewhat. The 8-speed automatic features paddle shifters. The Sport mode significantly tightens up the acceleration curve. While a subjective \\'anecdotal\\' opinion, my repair shop owner who has owned and driven some of the fastest cars out there (Lambos, Ferraris, Mercedes AMGs), says my car accelerates off the line in what feels to him like a 4.6 second 0-60. The supercharger pulley upgrades I\\'m planning will add another 100 hp, perhaps dropping the 0-60 time to 4.2 or 4.3. At a purchase price of  $17,400 it\\'s clearly a bargain. Audi makes 3 levels of options, the highest being what they call \\'Prestige\\'. My Prestige 3.0T has all but two options. Getting behind the wheel to drive the 45 minute commute to work in Massachusetts is always a pleasure! Refined. Fast. Comfortable. Car drives like a dream My 4th Audi, bought it used 2012 A6Prestigue supercharge. My first in 88\\' 91,01 and now 2012.  Take good care of your Audi and it will take care of you.  Living in NEw England its specially important to have Quattro for those crazy winter.  Every time I feel it\\'s time to get a newer car, I do actually go and test drive, Bmw, Mercedes, I even tried a couple other cars.  But there\\'s no handling like a Audi...I can\\'t afford a brand new 60k Audi, but buying a precertified used is still very good.  I considered purchasing a brand new car in 25-30k.  Problem, they don\\'t hold the value like a Audi do so think in the long run too.  Thats my opinion. A Real Jem. This car is in excellent condition. I would not sell it except that I MUST STOP DRIVING. Finally got my A6  German \"cruise\" missile I was fortunate enough to find a rare very loaded A6 sport just off lease. Previous owner had Audi Care so all the services were done-key to a used Audi. I have continued meticulous maintenance through local Audi dealer. Car has Sport Package, night vision, HUD, Prestige, OEM 20\" wheels, Havana black-incredibly cool color upon close inspection- nougat interior heated cooled, LED headlights and interior, adaptive cruise, Nav, becomes WIFI hotspot, on and on. Huge trunk, fold down rear seats-tons of cargo space. Does not have B&O sound, my traded S4 did. Have to say I find nothing to fault with the Bose surround to take nothing away from B&O both are great (Bose$6K+ additional cost on this car. MSRP was $67K.  Bought for $34.5K with 49K miles. Car presents as near new. 8 speed auto is a pleasant upgrade from the 7 speed in S4. DSG was great but, this tranny shifts like silk and does not require costly DSG fluid replacement intervals. Plus you still get the paddles if you want to use them. Mileage is a solid 28-29 highway. 8th gear makes the difference. S4 struggled to get 23 on highway. Pick up is robust when needed but, super smooth and comfortable unless you get into the right pedal. Awesome car. This is my 4th Audi. I highly recommend the Prestige package, it costs more but is in my opinion clearly worth it. Great car. Added Revo stage 1 software $999.00. It has made a significant difference. According to provider added about 70-80 horses. I believe it. No check engine lights or any problems ever. Mileage unaffected unless I push the car repeatedly, I suppose, because I never do that. This car still gets comments from strangers. Great car if you can find one well maintained. 117K on the odo. Everything works perfectly.Gdub Unreal I have the Prestige package, Innovation package with night vision and the 20\" sport package.I cannot believe how much power this car has.I mean really, this car fly\\'s.I was clocking 94 mph like it was nothing on the highway.Of course I did not do it for long, but I am convinced I could have had this car at 130 mph very quickly.Off the line it is very sharp and sends you back in the seat.If you have it in sport mode it can get real stupid.Of course I have already had the idiot kid next to me in a lowered Honda Prelude with his fat muffler trying to impress his girlfriend which only led to him looking stupid in my rear view mirror. far exceeds my expectations I bought the prestige line 2012 as the \\'13s were coming into the showroom and got a great deal.This car exceeds my 2005 Acura RL in every way possible, although the costs on an inflation-adjusted basis were nearly identical. Most importantly:after 6000 miles, I do not have any rattles, squeaks or mechanical-electrical problems of any kind.Love this car! German Gem with Head Turning Looks I am very pleased with my decision on purchasing the Audi A6. It has great exterior design combined with great interior design and fit/finish. I love the many subtle design cues that I didn\\'t notice when shopping around. I have enjoyed the Audi MMI and find it very easy to operate and get familiarized with; while it also appears to seamlessly pair and operate with my iPhone for telephony and audio uses. At night, the cabin is nicely lighted with the \"cockpit\" lights and nice (adjustable) ambient lighting which I didn\\'t even know it had prior to purchasing.I feel Audi has a strong product portfolio for 2012 that has exceptional design, technology and value among its luxury  Sleeper This car has been owned for 6000 miles now.It has all of the features one could ask for, including an incredible sound system Bose 14 speaker system.The prestige model adds the S line exterior and really sets the front end apart from the other models.Gas consumption is a combined 25mpg.It can go from a comfort cruiser to a rocket with a few button pushs and a flick of the wrist to shift into sport mode.What is so incredible about this car is it seems like it is two cars in one when you make the adjustments from comfort to sport.Interior is top notch and so far squeak and rattles are non existent.The normal suspesion is pretty stiff on its own (which I like).Good control! Beyond My Expectations I\\'ve had my A6 Prestige 3.0 for about 3 months and clocked about 3,500 miles.This car is amazing.Well beyond my expectations.Exceptionally smooth and quiet ride.Effortless power.Quick and instant acceleration at any speed.The car feels solid and drives like it\\'s on rails.The exterior design is sleek and powerful while still having a luxury image.The interior is equally as nice.Very comfortable seats.The wood grain inlays have a beautiful high-end look and feel.I love the lightning-like feel and acceleration from the supercharger.Cruising at 80 mph is effortless at a bit over 1800 rpms.All this with outstanding gas mileage.Two recent 400 mi trips averaged 34 mpg ! Loving my car, but... WOW!!! That was my 1st impression of this car. The car looks nice on the outside and looks stunning on the inside. After testing driving the 2013 Cadillac XTS, I was real close to buying it but for some reason I kept looking at the 2012 A6 and I\\'m glad that I did. I\\'m coming out of a 2008 Infiniti M35 and driving the new A6 was night and day. The Audi has a great car on their hands. I\\'m loving it so far but the car is lacking some feature that my M35 had. You can not control the a/c by voice, no remote start, no remote power windows up or down option and to get a power steering wheel you have to get the prestige package. Tons of room in this car. Besides those minor things I LOVE THIS CAR. Certainly different from prior A6\\'s I have only had this car about a week and its my 3rd A6 with Premium plus package.I replaced an 06 with a 2012 . While this A6 is quite nice, it does lack the luxury feel that accompanied my last2006 A6 with the same package. Sound proofing seems a little less and the road noise is certainly more noticeable. I had 18\" tires on my last A6 and barely heard them. Now its an issue. Things like keyless entry which came with Premium plus editions has new limitations. Its really just key less start as you have to use the fob to unlock and lock the doors. This was not the case in the 2006 version. Its still early in ownership so maybe I will forget how great the other A6\\'s were WOW!!! Having owned an \\'07, \\'09 and \\'11 A6s, I fugured that that couldn\\'t be be much change for 2012.Was I ever wrong! This car blows away any of its competition.I purchased the Prestice with Driver Assist and Cold Weather Package.I did not think the other options were warranted.This car is like a smaller version of the A8.I love the new 2012! Love the A6... I just purchased my 2012 A6 Certified used.Drove all day from Southern California to Phoenix, AZ to get it.During the last 10 years I\\'ve gone through 7 different cars from BMW to Land Rover.... & by far this is the best car I\\'ve ever owned.... I traded my 2011 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI for the Audi.I drove the BMW 535 & Lexus... but when I drove the A6 I didn\\'t want to drive anything else, it was almost like the car picked me....I own a custom vehicle wrap shop & will be wrapping the A6 in a two tone matte black & matte dark grey.I had the headliner & pillars done in Black Suede... Brilliant Car Got the 3.0T prestige with Innovation, cold and 20 inch sport package and B&O soundThis car is a beauty both to look and to drive.Test drove the Jaguar XF, BMW 535 xi The Jag drove well and looked great but it dint match the technology available in Audi the other draw back was lack of a 4 wheel drive...the Audi quattro is unreal it gives you that added reassurance of stability.The BMW 535xi just dint feel right to drive not like the old BMW , the AUdi just kills the BMWboth in looks and drive quality.this is a fast car with great handling, build quality and technology and to top it good milage getting 27 on freeway and 18 in stop and go Audi A6 - Hits it out of the park! Just purchashed the new A6 and absolutely love it. The looks, the comments this car is a stud!It drives in all modes, you pick!How awesome can that be!This car is so intuitive, it is before its time!I test drove all of the competition BMW, Mercedes-Benz, even the new Lexus and there is no comparison. Audi A6 w/20\" Sport Package classes them all I\\'ve had my Audi A6 for 3 months now and there are no real disappointments.I love the rock solid feel of the car.The acceleration is impressive for such a large car.While the technology is impressive, Audi has a little ways to go with the AudiConnect feed - the Online services such as news, sports, etc. are too limited.I love the WiFi connectivity.The next generation should add much more content.The interior is extremely spacious and comfortable. This Car Picked Me! As many drivers of mid-sized luxury sport sedans, I too considered the usual suspects: 535Xi, 3-class, Lex-GS, and a few others.This Audi combines style with power and great handling.It\\'s for driving and after checking the competition, this car rose above them and \"picked me\".My best car decision! Innovative, fast, unusually competent I have owned Audi\\'s in years past, and my 2012 A6 (Prestige 3.0 Supercharged V6) shows how intensely the brand intends to play against global competitors. The car has a very modern exterior view, embodied most in the LED headlights and aggressive front. The interior has a tight, modern aesthetic that feels very comfortable to occupy.I deleted sport options on my ordered vehicle, and the ride on the 18\" wheels is palatial on rougher New England roads while still being tight and making a fairly heavy car feel very nimble and spry. Excellent MPG for the effortless, continuous power available. Whisper quiet at 85MPH. BOSE stereo is clean but could use more punch. Flawless snow performance. The Best car I ever drove I am a new Audi owner, I never thought this car would be so much fun to drive, it is light and fast, if you are wanting a fast car that is easy on the fuel, this car is the best one. My last trip was about 540 miles and I had another 125 miles left on the range using the same tank of gas, this car comes with a cvt that allows the car to drive in like a manual, automatic, or a CVT, if you want to drive easy it is so smooth on the highway, if you want a more power then shift it to dynamic mode and you will get to 120 miles/ hour in seconds. You will get a rush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The interior is Awsome, This year Mercedes-Benz and BMW left are left the dust.  Really Enjoying My A6 I looked at several cars including BMW, Mercedes and Lexus. The detail to fit and finish on interior materials was the deciding factor for me. Audi is top notch on their quality materials. Plenty of power from the V6 engine; love the AWD and the car simply has a smooth feel to it.  Almost perfect! Everytime I look at my A6 I seem to love it just a little bit more.WE looked at EVERYTHING, including E-Class (hated the plastic interior), 5 series (hated the nav system), ES350 (nice car but unstimulating), GS350 (overpriced), S80 (questionable reliability) and Genesis (couldn\\'t bring myself to spend that much on a Hyundai).The A6 blows them all away with the understated class and top notch interior.iIf I had to find one thing, I would complain about the the size of the side pillar between the front and back seats (I am not a card designer so I don\\'t know the official name).it\\'s a little too thick and when making a let turn you sometimes have to lean forward to check for traffic. AWESOME CAR!!! I absolutely love this car, amazing power, wonderful stability and control, immaculate interior, perfect craftsmanship!!!  Way beyond my expectations I thought the 5 series was a nice car, until I went to the Audi dealer.We found the Audi to be so much nicer than the BMW that there was no comparison.One drive in the A6 and I was sold. After the fact, I am continually more and more impressed with this car.I am very, very pleased.  Audi A6 v. BMW 535xi I decided that my next car would be a BMW 535xi or the Audi A6.My wife drives a 2008 BMW 535xi T and we really love the car...it does drive like a dream.However, the new 2012 BMW 535xi is a big disappointment.Driving characteristics are null/void...nothing there...boring.Is the BMW nice- yes, absolutely.Is it refined, of course.But ultimately the BMW does not compare to the new Audi A6.I was shocked, floored and surprised.It is that noticable of a difference.We are thrilled with the purchase, ride, technology, and price ($2,000 off for current BMW owners).Most gorgeous car we\\'ve ever owned...and my 6 & 8 year olds love the heated seats. Love This Car.... Was not in love with the new BMW 5 series (last car), so gave this a look and am really happy that I did.The interior is just very nice.Very elegant.Not that cold and sterile look that BMW conveys (my opinion of course).Just enough buttons to do what you want without that cluttered Acura \"we have a button or knob for everything\" look.The performance is a good balance between certainly gets the job done while maintaining good fuel economy which I actually car about these days.On the exterior, the LED lights and 20\" rims give it that slightly aggressive and sporty look that BMW has lost (again, just my opinion).So easy to use everything.Good interface. Awesome car with painful seats 2012 A6 is a triumph of technology and if you option it you can get amazing nav, heads-up display, adaptive cruise control that works in the most stop & go of traffic.In dash display and 7 inch pop up displays are great and more in the line of sight (and hence ? safer) than typical nav systems. The night vision system is not helpful to the extent that it only seems to show pedestrians at certain midrange distances and doesn\\'t appear to be programmed to detect anything else (deer).Shuts down at above 77 degrees F. Unfortunately design rounding the side bolsters of the seats up into the shoulder blades makes the seats painful to sit in (average ht, wt male) so will likely be selling car. Incredible, Fabulous ... WOW!!! First time Audi owner ... I could not be happier with the A6.Considered the BMW 535xi, e350, and Infiniti 37x.Test drove each 2 different times and each time I was swayed towards the A6.BMW was quickly eliminated because of the run flat tires.I have heard several stories that they are costly and prone to issues.37x was eliminated because the shifting seemed a bit harsh and quirky.Also, I did not like the navigation.e350 was eliminated (even though I was offered a 11% off MSRP) because in the end I preferred the ride, feel, and technology of the A6.For me, the A6 offered the best ride and performance of the others. Sporty car, great interior, great for family This is my first German car and am very happy so far.I compared the new A6 to 535xi and Infiniti M.The A6\\'s interior was by far the best of the three - very comfortable seats, awesome high tech features, and enough room for 3 kids in the back.MMI/voice system works much better than the BMW\\'s version.Great fuel efficiency on highway, much better than 28 mpg rated.One of best features is adaptive cruise control, which works amazingly well.One downside in this particular vehicle was that it was built and sold with a \"2.0T\" badge on rear and was also sold without the appropriate rear view camera chip, both items which the dealer will address.Braking a tad longer than on my \\'10 MDX. Great fun Compared A-6 to BMW 535 and bought A-6 which had much more standard equipment and is more fun to drive and visually striking.  My Dream Car! Car is beyond words.Materials is of the finest.A6 flys like a rocket & FLAWLESS in everyway!I had a 2012 Mustang on order & one look at the A6 & I was sold. So much for the MUSTANG.The $60,000 + is worth every penny for this car! Great know your dealer,Dont trust most people. have a great day. Great to drive, horrible to maintain Where to start ? Bought a 2001 A6 avant in 2006 with 106K on the clock. Car was in very good shape.Within a year started having some issue.Did timing belt replacement which is normal maintenance (about $500 in Audi parts if you do yourself). Have replaced the ABS module, 2 combi (EGR) valves, valve cover gaskets, etc.At 149K had to replace 3 steering arms ($700 at shop).Now transmission is acting up and need to replace at 151K.Still have problems with secondary air system and was told by tech probably carbon build up in intake manifold after all other attempted repairs. Great car to drive but very expensive if you don\\'t do the repairs yourself. High Maintenance Beauty I love my Avant wagon. It is beautiful driving and looking car but more expensive than ever to maintain. I purchased the car with 57,000 miles on it and took excellent care of it. I even used premium Mobile oil. The catalytic converter went our at 70,000. I have paid out $5,000.00 in repair costs not including the converter which I never had replaced. If you have money to carry the cost of ownership go for it! The driving experience is like none other.  Love my Audi Wonderfully smooth car. A treat to drive, both in the city and on the highway. Lots of space for family, a big dog and luggage. For all of our needs, it is a great car. Previously, I had the Audi A4 sports sedan. Likewise, it was a wonderful car. Poor quality car This is our second Audi and like the other  one, after 50K we ran into multiple defects (engine failures, electric  windows, leaks). Our latest repair at 60K miles, is more than $3K. It\\'s a fun car, but after the free maintenance periods (multiple repairs too, but since it\\'s free maintenance and warranty you tend to brush over these quality issues), the poor quality becomes too much. A good buy No Problem A-6 Avant exceeds expectations. Exceeds expectations in every manner.   Bought it used.. too expensive to fix!! Bought my Audi A6 2.8 Quattro with 121000 miles in 2014. In the last two years I\\'ve put $3000 into it and that was at small area mechanics. It\\'s hard to find someone that knows how to fix them so take it to someone that fixes German cars! The labor is the worst because they\\'re so hard to work on. I feel like every year I dish out more then it\\'s worth at this point, so trying to get a new car and it won\\'t be an Audi. I\\'ve had many leaks and the closed transmission system is a pain bc u can\\'t add fluid manually if it\\'s leaking. Also the pixels on the dash were going out when I bought it. Other than that the Quattro has gotten us through SEVERAL feet of snow no problem! That and the Bose system are probably the only good aspects of buying an older model with over 100k miles. Word of advice: make sure it was properly maintained at reputable dealerships and make sure u can afford the repaid costs! Just bought the A6 Quattro with 210k miles. This thing runs like a champ, it will need some minor cosmetic work, but or mechanically sound for year and the miles.I plan to dress this one up, and show it off with a new body kit, and rims and tires. Fun but a PAIN I\\'ve got drive a few cars such as a 2005 Caddy STS, a 2008 caddy CTS, a 2012 Buick LaCrosse, 2014 Caddy ATS, and a 2014 Caddy XTS. Honestly the Audi was the best and most fun car to drive. It handles better than all the rest and feels more like a GT car than a fat 4 door sedan. Although it\\'s such a blast to drive the reliability is garbage. I had it for one month before it was having a misfire . After i got that fixed it ran good for a day now it won\\'t stay running. Also the tubing inside is more brittle than glass. Also both cup holders have broke. I\\'ve already dropped about $1000 into it but im suspecting to be dropping more in the near future. Audi A6 2.8 Quattro Ok, so i bought this car off of my inlaws, who bought it certified with 25k on the odo. After owning it myself for 3 yrs, it now has 155k on it. It runs smoothly and effortlessly on the freeway and in and out of traffic around town. A pleasure to drive in all types of weather. Sure-footed confidence in rain, snow & ice. I put 4 studded snow tires on it each winter and have no trouble climbing any WV mountains! Amazing. I repair most things that break myself to keep repairs down to a minimum. 1 yr ago the timing chain guide rail (plastic), broke and cost me a new head! I did most of the work myself with a friend. That one set me back $1,000. A fluke I suppose...gas mileage is so-so. Buy something else I think my father summed up this car perfectly when he said this car is great... up until 80k miles.Yes, the car has exceptional awd power, fun in the winter along with luxury styling.However the designing of this car is terrible and don\\'t let anyone ever tell you otherwise.When my 2.7t\\'s alternator went out it took an entire day to replace.You have to take the front end off just to locate.It\\'s ridiculous!!! the 2.7t is designed to have an extended stay at the mechanic.Over 100 sensors will cause the CEL to appear.In summary, this car is like someone else\\'s pet; its fun to play with, it will make laugh at times but i rather not want to keep it. Fun to drive, but expensive Bought this car in \\'04 as a CPO\\'d car for my wife.  Love the 2.7T engine, a blast of a car to drive.  Comfortable ride.  The downside, expensive to repair, seems every year that we\\'ve had it, and especially since the warranties ran out, we\\'ve had a $1,500 + repair bill for the year.  Recently found that the trans needs work, hopefully this will be the last major item to repair for a long time.  We bought the car with only 33,000 on it, we\\'ve put maybe 36,000 more miles in 6 yrs. Electrical nightmare I bought this car for my wife in 2005.  We loved it.  We babied it in our garage.  I was careful when I wash it.  We took it for a drive south down to Vegas.  We started having lots of electrical problems. I thought that German cars were the best of the best.  Maybe not!!  The spot lights, I was fixing, once a week and then the dash display led pin lighting started to go.  Then I had other engine lights come on.  I went to the Audi dealer in Kelowna and asked what the would be the cost of repairing the dash and it was almost $2000.  I fixed what I could and quickly sold the car to a young lady( feeling very guilty).  I would never buy another Audi or Vw product again.  There is no quality.  audi = garbage I knew I was taking a big chance when I purchased this Audi a6 quattro turbo with 109,000 miles given the car\\'s reputation for poor reliability. However, I got it at a great price and was assured from the previous owner that it was well taken care of with all maintenance done as scheduled. With-in 3 weeks problems started, front struts started squeaking, took it to dealer to inspect, that will be $900.00 please. Then a few month\\'s later a/c went out dealer says just $1200.00 please. Then recently all dash lights went out without warning. Dealer says just $800.00 please. Turbo is failing I was told and will have to be replaced within the next 6 month\\'s. Dealer says just $2800.00 please. Never again! The Last Mohigan- 215K!  I discovered this site this evening as I am researching new vehicles. Alas, my Audi a6 and I are soon to part ways. We\\'ve endured 7.5 years together, with minimal disagreements. Outside of routine maintenance, I\\'ve invested perhaps 3-4k or so, collectively. Purchased the car with 27k, and it currently has over 215k on it! (with my occupation as sales manager, it behooves me to hold onto my vehicles). Can I say I\\'ve been pleased? in a word, yes! I am actually feeling a little saddened over my soon- to-be split with my a6, but as we all know, all good things must come to an end. The divorce is indeed amicable. Pleased with purchase overall I purchased this car over a year ago and thought a review would be of some help for others looking to purchase one. This is a great looking, great handling and riding vehicle considering the $4500 I paid for it. It was maintained well by the previous owner and had 130K on it when I purchased it. About 13,000 miles later here is what I have replaced: Aux. Fan for AC - $100, Two Front axles - $150, Front Brake Pads - $68.00, and Two Cam Seals - $16.00 for both. Audi wanted $1,800 to replace cam-seals. It took me approx 8 hrs to repair that problem. These are nice cars that are capable of running for a long time if maintained properly. If you are on a tight budget, don\\'t buy one. Absolute Tank! We bought it back in June of 06\\' with 131,000 miles on it, it now has 171,000. It was purchased as an extra vehicle for my wife who has tried her hardest to kill it. She has been in three accidents one of them quite serious, we fixed it and it runs and drives great. I change the oil every 5,000 with synthetic of course. I do it myself to save money. It does have some of the leaky issues and the drivers side window is testy, but to its credit its almost 10 years old been put through the ringer by my wife\\'s poor driving skills, and believe me, if you only knew. It is an awesome vehicle. Worth every penny. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy another Audi. It takes a lickin\\' and keeps on tickin\\'. 2001 A6 4.2  Purchased the 4.2 under the Audi Certified program. I\\'ve accumulated over 100k with this car and it runs and looks fantastic. Continues to deliver a performance oriented drive that is supplemented with comfort and reliability. Maintenance has been limited to expected repairs for a car with over 110k on it.  garbage Where do I begin to tell the story of a car that\\'s been a sin. Purchased this 2001 a6 quattro in March of last year used with 90,000 miles on it. It\\'s been a nightmare ever since. Numerous problems regarding electrical, turbo, and suspension components. I asked the dealer if the car comes with bags of money for all the repairs that it requires and it didn\\'t. Build quality on these cars is horrible. We traded it in recently for a 2010 Kia forte coup sx with a nice long warranty and piece of mind. My Favorite Car ever Leased new. Never a problem. Bought it from Audi, Never a problem.  I would like to buy a new car but after 114k miles I still can\\'t find one I like better. Our \\'06 Infinity M35x doesn\\'t compare, even though it is a more expensive car.   This thing just goes and goes.  Oil change, tires, window wiper blades.  Leaves no oil on my garage floor, just an unbelievable car.  At this rate, I have no plans to change before 150,000 miles.  Since the paint and interior still look great, only a car buff knows I am driving a ten year old vehicle.  Great car but can be expensive Excellent engine. Any review that says the  power isn\\'t there is way off. It produces almost 100 hp/liter which is excellent. Handling matches the power as well resulting in a very fun car. Also very comfortable on the interior. However, repairs will be expensive(count on that). I replaced both turbos which was roughly $4300. A word of advice is to make sure you have a mechanic who knows audis work on the car, not the guy down the street. Love the car but don\\'t want to end up paying for repairs.  Super car This is our third Audi, was impressed with the first two, (67 and 71) so I took the chance to purchase this one off Ebay for my wife.  We\\'ve put 35,000 miles on it in the last 4 years and other than regular maintenance, we have had only the alternator fail.  Average fuel economy 27 mpg in the summer and 23.5 mpg in the snow.  Best fuel economy on a trip so far was 32.1 mpg. It is a little hard on tires (or is that me?) The turbo\\'s really help with the high altitude here.  With all the driving we do on gravel and dirt roads, not a single squeak or rattle.  Super car. Great looking and that\\'s about it Purchased the car used with less then 30k miles. Had all the bells and whistles. Great looking car but no reliability in this vehicle. Before having 5ok miles timing belt had to be replaced and water pump went out. Great looking car but not up to par against Infiniti, BMW or Lexus...i will never buy another Audi again! Fun to drive Bought the car used w/ 38K miles, now with 110K. Has been a true pleasure to drive, I still get positive comments on it. Great on the highway and fun in the turns. Very comfortable for 4 with room in the trunk. Purchase with eyes open as repairs can get $$. I have an excellent independent mechanic shop (stay away from dealerships (one repair the dealer quoted $1700 to repair, they did it for $400) and with their help, I have to spend 500-2K a year on extra repairs and have never been stranded. Sports seats=will be uncomfortable if you need extra displacement upon seating. Sports suspension=firm ride. Alloy wheel=possible bent rims. A solidly built German car I bought this Audi A6 quattro with 2.8 V6 after reading a lot of reviews about this car. There were too many problems reported with 2.7T, so kept away from that. This 2.8 V6 can surely use more power, especially at low speeds. However, if you are little patient, the speed builds effortlessly from about 40-50 MPH. The ride quality is awesome. Little stiff for city driving, however the solid grip it has on the road makes for it. The car is built like a tank and you feel it at high speeds. The car gets more and more stable with higher speed. This is a huge difference in feeling after coming from cars like toyota camry and highlander. I love the interior and exterior looks and quality of material. My A6 Deserted Me! I wrote a very positive earlier review about how reliable the car was after 6 years of ownership. It must have jinxed me. Since then I\\'ve had an $1100 alternator replacement, a frozen front caliper and a broken right front coil spring (the day before I was to trade it in!)  I bought a new 2009 Ford Fusion SEL AWD with nav, leather, heated seats, alloy wheels, rear backup sensor, Microsoft Sync, etc for 1/2 the price of a new A6.  A close friend of mine who has the same car just spent $4000 in repairs on his 2001 A6.   Catalyic converter problems I bought the car as a certified used car. The converters were replaced by Audi at 52000 miles and 69000 miles later I find I need to replace them again to the tune of 2500.  It would appear the converters have a problem since I have maintained the car as directed by Audi and have always used premium fuel.  I would be concerned about buying a used high mileage Audi. Other than this hit and front end suspension repairs this has been a good car to drive.  Please send money. ;-)   120,000 miles and going strong I am the original owner and have the car almost 10 years.  There were some early electrical problems, fixed under warranty.  I lowered the car which improved the handling and as such had to replace control arm bushings at 100k.  Otherwise just small problems such as cup holders, window switches and a window which doesn\\'t always go up easily.  The paint still looks great as does the interior.  No ripping or dramatic fading of leather or trim.  Huge trunk.  Great set of options compared to BWM at the time.  Overall I\\'m happy and love the quattro.  Next car will be another A6 or the A5, or maybe an Infinity G37x. More maintance than I can afford Bought it used thinking I could put 200,000 miles on it.  Not so, Engine gaskets and seals twice, frozen turbo, Airbag controller those are the $1,00 plus.  Less than $1,000 tie rods, control arms, misc suspension parts, window guides, differential seals (all 3), O2 sensors.  Fun to drive , great to look at but built poorly. Too many problems I purchased my vehicle independently from a very nice old lady with 150000 miles on the vehicle and she had nothing more than the usual things to fix like brakes and fluid. I have had the car for half a year now and have spent 7k on repairs so far. 5k of that coming within a week and a half of each other. It is a fantastic car to drive but is not nearly reliable enough for someone who depends a great deal on their car. It has turned out to big nothing more than a money pit for me. So much for all the buzz about German engineering that I heard when I first purchased the car. Not so good! I looked at Audi\\'s for a long time and finally bought it!  Almost 2 years later and boy what a mistake!!  I was trading in a Jeep so I could get better gas mileage and it\\'s not a big improvement.  I get about 18-20mpg & that\\'s 75% highway and rest city.  I have had to replace many parts and of course they are EXTREMELY expensive to fix.  The car rides nice and looks good but be prepared to spend a lot to fix it when it breaks!  For supposedly being a German performance car it doesn\\'t handle that well.  2.7T has good power most of the time but there is a decent delay if you try to accelerate quickly.  I won\\'t ever own an Audi or foreign car again, this one ruined it!  Great car  I have owned a 2.8 A6 prior to this 4.2.  I have been hard on my cars but not reckless or with ignorance. I enjoy taking the long way home just to drive on some mountain roads with these cars.  I have not found them unreliable and actually I trusted them more than any other car I\\'ve been in.  Short drives do not do them justice they shine in adverse weather conditions and excessively long drives.  I have only had to fix things that the previous owners had damaged them due to ignorance.  Quality is there, you just need to appreciate it more and treat better than a normal car. High maintenance The car has good looks and drives well when not in the shop. Audi engineers need to make a car more reliable and less costly to fix. Had the car 2.5 years and spent $16,000 in repairs from engine work to sensors to cracked rims. What next? Dont buy one new or used its a money pit! This car is bad! Purchased the vehicle used, drove for 5 months...over $2,000 in maintenance bills! Attempted to trade in vehicle. Even the Audi dealer would only give me $4K for the trade-in. This car is a nightmare!  My advice: Do not buy this vehicle, especially this engine model, unless you\\'re loaded and can stomach the repair bills.  Buyer beware! My favorite car ever When I saw my Audi, there was no doubt that it was the one I wanted.  I enjoyed it right from the start and still find it a pleasure to drive. I like a car that stands out--and it does. It catches the eye and it is the best car I\\'ve ever owned. It\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s fun to drive and the comfort can\\'t be beat. The heated leather seats are soothing on a cold winter\\'s drive home from shopping.   Nice performance car for the money I own a 6 speed and love it. I have enjoyed great mileage and its fun to drive. Every time I see the car I can\\x92t believe the its mine. The engine is very sophisticated with 5 valves 2 turbos.  What does bug me about the car is anti-lock brakes bounce back and vibration in the front end. I do get a loose feeling at low speeds in the suspension over bumps. I had the same feeling in my 96 A4.   OK Very reliable. Very quiet ride and great comfortable seating. Visibality is very good all around. Triptonic gear is great when needed. mileage short\\\\ distances is 17. Miles per gallon using 87 octane. Turning radius is remarkable. A car that does every thing well! If this car were a woman I would marry her. The tiptronic shifts wonderfully and in manual mode holds gears right to red line. The quattro all wheel drive is excellent in the snow and when pushing hard through a corner. The coach work is beautiful. And the engine is a gem.  The best and worst car I\\'ve driven The audi a6 2.7t is one of the best cars I\\'ve driven. It handles, performance, and feels so comfortable. After a few months smoke came out of the tail pipes. I took it in the shop and found out there was a oil leak plus coolant leak. Auto shop says it\\'ll be about 3 grand for repairs and my limited warranty didn\\'t cover gasket and seals. That stinks especially when it was about 2 grand for the warranty. After reading other people experience with the same problems makes  me wonder. Audi quality kinda stinks. Maybe a weak gasket or bad quality seals or just the way it was build internally could lose value.   High Maintenance Its a luxury sedan(I wouldnt call it luxury sports) since it doesnt handle corners as well as a BMW would. Quattro is good and it has a solid body. But parts under the hood are very unreliable and break often. I\\'ve had the cam seals and valve cover gaskets changed twice, headlamp went out, coolant leak(water pump changed), wheel cracked, door handle  cable snapped, cup-holder broken, oxygen sensors failed. I spent $4000 last month fixing all the above and a timing belt at a local mechanic(dealership wouldve cost me $6000) And now the auto-dimming rearview mirror is broke - i plan to fix it myself I love the car This a great car if you love to drive. The car responds to your driving. Great handling in any type of weather. Great performance car. I push the car and it still ask for more. So far so good... Bought this used with 78k miles. It\\'s a 2001 4.2 with sport package and all upgrades. First thing I did was do full timing belt service. Not cheap, but good insurance. Car runs great and performance is strong.  Previous owner lowered 1.5\", so handling is great, but ride is choppy. Hazard light unit failed shortly after buying -- a $300 fix. But with both fingers crossed, I\\'m very pleased with the car. Around $20k invested in total now. Barring any major service, this is a good value for what you get. 2001 Audi A6 Performance, handling, and overall quality very good.  Very happy so far. Shopped around and compaired with other cars of this caliber, the all wheel drive was a strong selling point. 6 Years of great Driving and Reliability I\\'m the original owner. 78k miles now. Replaced brakes and tires twice. Had 2 minor mechanical problems fixed under warranty. Gets 26 mpg on the highway; 22 around town. It has the perfect combination of sporty handling and acceleration along with comfortable cruising. I keep thinking about a new one (the 6-year itch)  but this one has a lot of life and fun driving left in it.  This is my 3rd Audi--1988, 1996. Each was excellent. Inexpensive Luxury Great car. Much more reliable than the 2.7 turbo. Comfortable to drive with a bit of sport to it when using the shift feature. Fuel economy could be better but is great for what is essentially a large car with all wheel drive. Plenty of room both up front and for rear seat passengers. Big trunk. Great handling and never slips in the snow. I can just jump in and go with up to 8 inches of snow. The only problem that I had was with the dash display fading but it was replaced under an extended warranty. 2001 Audi A6 2.8  I purchased my A6 2.8 used in 2002. It was in perfect condition and had low miles. It was, and still is, a beautiful car and a pleasure to drive. At the time of purchase, my commute to work was about 32 miles one way on interstate highway. Speeds where high and traffic heavy. I always felt safe in my Audi due to their reputation and side curtain air bags. I love everything about this car except its lousy maintenance history. It has been a very expensive (dollars and time) car to own. I can live with components wearing out and needing replacement but the continual oil leaks are unacceptable. It seems that I\\'ve had every gasket and seal replace on the engine, drive train and power steering. Great car - if you don\\'t mind the repair Initially I was in love with this car from the first test drive, but 4 months and 7000 miles later I no longer own it.  The car is a joy to drive and with the optional sport suspension and 18 inch rims has absolutely incredible handling.  The car is extremely comfortable to drive. It had 61,000 miles on it when I bought it, and in my time with the car it needed cam seals, valve cover gaskets, temperature sensor, door lock, instrument cluster, HID ignitor, radio, power steering pump, front brake rotors.  Near as I can figure about $5000 worth of work - thank God for the CPO warranty.  I was able to get pretty much out of it what I paid for it because of all the repairs which were done. Should I Stay or Should I Go? I bought a 2001 2.7T with 80,000 miles in September 2005.  Since then, I had to replace two bad turbos and oxygen sensors.  After that it was a couple broken seals.  Then a couple months after having the 80,000 mile check up, the transmission/4 wheel drive system went out (3 weeks at an Audi dealer waiting for parts).  I had begun to notice some strange goings on with the interior lights.  In addition, when in heavy traffic for an extended period of time, the trip meter (miles before filling up) flips out and a blinking time set begins to display.  Good thing I bought an expensive 2 year extended warranty with the car, but I\\'m really falling out of love.  1st time Audi owner Great power. You get all the comfort style and performance you would expect from an Audi. Just run good gas and oil through it and let the oil gauge hit 175 before bringing it over 3000 rpm. Great power. Little turbo lag. I love it. Luxurious interior and nice ride, unique The car I bought had some maintenance issues before I purchased it.  I have found a dealership that very professional and not overpriced.  The quality of work is good.  I also found parts on line to circumvent overpricing.  The car is a dream. It needs the normal 6 yr old car things, but it makes me smile each time I get in.  The interior design is gorgeous! Yes, Audi has a few minor switch, cup holder and headlight issues but those parts aren\\'t very high. The check engine diagnostics can be done for free at a local autoparts store. The fuel, air filters can be purchased in bulk to save $.  It is the price for luxury and it isn\\'t bad.  I gladly drive it instead of the mass similiar car. OK Nice car, powerful engine and fun to drive, but it does not offer reliability.  Last summer it spent 2 months at the dealership because of a weird problem with a computer part.  Before that, had a problem with the brakes, before that the front seat moved back and forth, by itself when driving in reverse.   Do I like this car, yeah I do, its a nice car to drive.  Would I buy another Audi ....  NO WAY !!!  I need to rely on my car and can\\'t afford to have it in the shop so often. Under rated at \"best in class\" From the solid feel of the door handle to the unreal hold on snowy winding Connecticut roads, this is the all-around benchmark for mid-luxury.  Before falling for the A6 4.2, I drove (among others) the 540, G35 and both Lexuses.  Each excel in one area, but not one adds it all in one package like the Audi.  And at a better price.  The only thing missing for me is that it\\'s not an RS6.  But that additional money is tied up in my weekend convertable. Save your Money! There are many pros behind this car.  It has a beautiful interior, it is fun to drive, it handles better than most other cars and has amazing pick up.  The cons, however, completely out weigh the pros.  This car was purchased certified pre owned with 36K miles.  Within the first year, it has broken down(thermostat overheated and coolant tank cracked), and has been taken in 18 times due to various problems (ie- when driving the automatic, it would slip into 2nd gear for no reason), and has most recently required a new transmission.  I regret falling for the aestetics and strongly recommend anyone against the Audi.  It\\'s not worth the headache. so far so great We have the six-speed and there is no hint of turbo lag.  I get 23+ mpg on combined city/highway driving (probably because I don\\'t always drive like I have something to prove).  Acceleration is amazing when needed, and the engine picks up anywhere from 1.5Krpm upwards in any gear.  we got the sport suspension and sport wheels, which means I can go around corners practically with no braking.  Saves wear and tear on the brakes and gives the kids a thrill :-).  The stereo (Symphony) is excellent.   Bought it used with 51K mi for less than 17K$.  Try getting something with the feature set (Xenons, auto-dimming mirrors, power heated leather ...) in other brands for anything close. Great Value Very happy, great car all around.   Only complaint would be that the suspension can is a bit soft for my liking when pushing it in the corners. Longing for reliability By far the most unreliable car I\\'ve had.  Bought the car use as \"Certified Pre-Owned\" with 32000 miles on it.  The car was wonderful the first 3 months, the the problems started.  In the next 6 months, it spent more time at the dealership than in my garage.  Most problems were of electrical nature. Bottom line ..... save yourself a lot of trouble by avoiding this car and this manufacturer all together. Turbo  This car is awesome! You can\\'t compare the features and technology Audi incorporates into its car to BMW for the price.  The Turbo rips once you get going above 30 and its the safest car I\\'ve ever driven.  The power assist steering is a joy around town and at high speeds the car really locks down.  Heated back seats are a crowd pleaser and if you ski its has a split seat and ski pass through.  Put a good pair or tires on it and you\\'ll love this car. A Great Car I love this car!  Bought it new and have had one electrical problem with radio that was covered under warrenty, but that\\'s it.  10,000 miles between oil changes can\\'t be beat.  Very reliable and safe - best 4wd vehicle around for on street winter driving. May be I\\'m just lucky... ... but I haven\\'t had any problems. It\\'s an awesome car, well engineered, quite reliably built considering the number of features it has. Audi brand is definitely underrated in North America, but it is one of the hottest in Europe. Every time I get into my Audi I feel better already. It is excellent for highway cruising, but it also easily reveals its sporty character when pushed a little bit harder. And one more thing - safety. This is my second Audi A6, the first one was totaled after I was T-boned by Mercedes SUV at about 50 mph - pretty nasty collision. Not a slightest injury to myself, thanks to the side airbags and rigid body structure. Buy one pre owned I purchased my A6 4.2 from an Audi dealership, If there are any reliability issues I am going to assume they are already taken care of, the car is quick, fun to drive and is not afraid in bad weather even with 300 ponies going to the ground (thank you quattro) my best advice, see if they have service records on the car you wish to purchase, and ask them what was done to the car before they put in on the lot.  The dealership I bought mine from spent about 1800 dollars in the shop correcting a few problems associated with most Audis.  I have owned a lot of cars, this one is fun and a great value for a luxury sedan (thousands less than BMW or Mercedes) Problematic My Audi A6 looks beautiful, but this is probably the worst car I have ever had  and this includes a used 1973 chevy monte carlo I bought for $250 when a freshman in college.  If you buy this car, be prepared to spend a lot of money for part replacements and repairs.  Just when you think you\\'ve seen everything, this car surprises you with an unthinkable issue.  My advise ....  buy something else....  What was I thinking ? The first 4 months were great, then the problems started ...  weird problems, you open the sun roof and the air conditioning would stop working, turn the headlights on and the wind sheild wippers turn on, accelerate on the highway, ABS lights come on, brakes are applied and you couldn\\'t go over 20 miles / hour/  And the worst thing is, the dealer doesn\\'t know how to fix it.  I\\'m gonna trade it in. Love & Hate I have a love and hate relationship with my Audi A6 2.7T.  Its beautiful, fun to drive, great acceleration and handling, but the car is unbelivably unreliable.  I will take it back to the dealership for the third time this month.  Electronics and Electrical components seem to be Audi\\'s weak points and not even the Factory Certified mechanics at the dealer can diagnose the many problems this car has had.  Too bad, I really liked this car, but it will probably be my last Audi, if not my last German built car. Nothing but poblems This is a fun car to drive, that is when it is not in the shop.  I\\'ve had so many problems with this car that I will never every consider an audi again and judging with all the things I\\'ve been reading on the Internet, I\\'m not in the minority.  It seems like they are incapable of fixing the electrical problems assocaited with this series.   What ever happened to German Craftsmanship and quality.  Maybe this car was made in East Germany ! Great car I bought this used 2001 A6 2.7T with the sport package this year after my 2000 A6 2.7 (without sport package) was totaled out.  Both cars are very similar, but if you are a driving enthusiast, I highly recommend the sport package, which gives you larger wheels and stiffer suspension.  It is a great car with lots of room.  I love the Quattro in winter (here in Wisconsin). Great fun - but poor reliability This is the last in a senies of Audi\\'s I\\'ve owned since an A4 2.8 Q in 1998. Since then there\\'s been an 2001 Audi TT Roadster, a 2001 S4 and a 2004 S4. While I love the comfort and the handling (I have the sports pkg on the A6 4.2), the reliability has been absymal (its been at the dealership every month this calendar year - in addition to regular maintenance). Its a love-hate. I love the speed, acceleration, handling, comfort, styling and with snow tires its GREAT on snow. But I can\\'t afford the maintenance ($800 to replace the rear sunshade last month - ouch!) Performance With an Interior to Match! I have put over 40,000 miles (85,000 total) on this car and have only done minor maintenance with one minor electrical problem ($250).  Buying this car used is a steal since it came with a $46,000 sticker price.  Find one that hasn\\'t had problems and go and buy it!   Target Guy I have only had this car a month, I love it!  The zip it gives is impressive! The car is a blast to drive. Problems Performance is outstanding, but here are the problems I\\'ve had recently:  Check engine light is always on.  Car wouldn\\'t start, doors won\\'t lock, alarm, windows , sunroof, controls on steering wheel, interior lights don\\'t work.  Headlights flash if I lock the car.  Airbag replaced.  If stuck in traffic on a hot day, the temp gauge heads for the red zone. Need to sell the car or move next door to the Audi dealership. Versatile luxury sedan This is possibly the best all weather luxury sedan ever made.  Great for northern winters, and fun in the summer.  Build quality is excellent, and the ride is better than a BMW. Awesome car.....except I love this car, frustrating as it is. From the performance to the comfort and sound system it is a joy to drive. My wife and I have driven Passats for the last 5 years with virtually no problems. We\\'ll this Audi is a different story. From exterior water intrusion to interior electrical and mechanical problems, this car is surely testing my patience. My recommendation, never ever buy a used Audi that is not certified. Just as important, consider your proximity to the nearest Audi dealer, all warranty work must be done there! I admit the dealer has treated me very well. I just prefer not to be there! I still have a long way to go to reach my low reliabilty standard of my Jeep Grand Wagoneer! Really love my Audi Bought my Audi used with 32,000 miles on it.  I\\'ve driven it for a year and put 12,0000 miles on it and it drives and looks like a dream.  I\\'m complimented on it when people drive with me and have enjoyed every hour driven.  I am planning on my next car to be an Audi The A6 2.7T Rocks My 2001 Audi A6 2.7T is my first Audi but it definitely is not my last.  I love this car and everything about it.  The inside display on the dash at night is by far the best of any European vehicle.  My in-laws have a Mercedes-Benz and it doesn\\'t even come close to this car. A6 4.2-Pretty Good I last owned an A4 2.8q that was leased. I decided that I did not want to be restricted by mileage overages so we bought a CPO 2001 Audi A6 4.2.  I think it is probably one of the best looking cars made and definetly the best looking Audi except for the RS6.  It has a very aggressive look to it.  It had the Sport package so the ride is firm but I like feeling connected to the road. It came with some pretty aggressive Yokohama 255/40/17\\'s that are great in the dry roads but truly stink in the snow.  The car could not get up a hill in our local area, so I had to back down the hill and start over.  I guess the Quatro system is only as good as the tires.  But for pete sake,these cost $200 a piece What a Car I\\'ve had absolutely no complaints \\rsince purchasing my 2001 Audi A6 2.8 quattro Sedan\\ra little over four months ago.  The driving is \\rsuperb for any weather, especially \\rChicago\\'s cold and harsh winters.  The \\rleather seats fit me comfortably, and \\rthe Bose sound system blows me away.  \\rWhat a car! Great Car, Great Price I picked up my 2001 Audi A6 4.2 at a used car  Go with a Lexus The Audi is indeed a sexy sleek \\rbeautiful machine but the maintenance \\ris a nightmare.  From the dash lights \\rto the creeky noise of the steering \\rwheel (that Audi still can\\'t \\ridentify), water pumps and the wear \\rand tear of the \"aluminum\" shifter \\rplate.  I\\'d say that the maintenance \\rmoney could be better spent.  I came \\rfrom a 1995 Lexus ES 300 with160,000 miles\\ron it that still ran like a champ.  My 2001 A6 has \\rbeen to Audi twelve times now for warranty \\rwork.  I have spent more time in the \\rloaner car.  Just my advice - you \\rdon\\'t see many on the road for a \\rreason.....  Good luck. Disappointed in CT I loved my 2006 Audi A6 for a while, but \\rproblems seem to be non stop and very \\rexpensive.  I needed a replacement rediator, \\rhad a misassembled dashboard, leaking \\rtransmission and differential, all 200 \\rmiles out of warranty, (don\\'t count on \\rany compassion from Audi).  The AWD is \\rfabulous, the interior is just \\rbeautiful, the fold down rear seats \\rmake it a mini-ute vehicle.  It was \\rthe perfect choice for me, but I am \\rdone with Audi.  My replacement car \\rwill be an AWD but from a company that \\rstands behind its cars. Audi A6 2.7T Great car, comfort and road hanling \\rall in one package. first audi The audi a6 4.2 is a great car in any  Great car when it not in the shop I really enjoy my A6 2.7T except that is\\rhas spent too much time in the shop. \\rProblems arose at about 2.5 years and\\rits last stay in the shop was 26 days\\rwaiting for a tourqe converter.  I was\\rgiven a loaner, a much lesser car.  At\\rend of lease I was well under the\\rmileage limit so although I paid for the\\rmore expensive A6, part of the time I\\rdrove a stripped A4.  The dealership and\\rAudi have not been very responsive so no\\rmore Audis for me nor would I recommend\\rthe car or the dealer to others.  They\\rare not reliable. Could have been a contender... This car has a solid and subtle \\rdesign.  The interior is laid out well \\rwith exception to the climate control.  \\rPerformance is also exceptional with \\rthe factory performance package and \\roverall features are above average.  \\rWarranty and scheduled service was \\rhandled professionally and efficiently. \\rThat said, the implementation of the so-\\rcalled solid design is extremely poor. \\rBased on the number of trips to the \\rdealer for serious defects and warranty \\rservice and recalls, I give a very low \\rreliability rating for this car and I \\rwould never buy another Audi again. Why is Audi overlooked by so many? I\\'m completing 4 years driving my A6 \\r2.7T, and can easily rate as the best \\rcar I\\'ve ever had, including two E-\\rClass Mercedes. Its been utterly \\rflawless, dealer service is excellent, \\ris both fun and luxurious to drive, \\roffers strong V8-like performance.\\r As my lease end neared, I checked out \\rnew several cars. NO car I\\'ve driven \\rmatched the A6 balance of drivability, \\rcomfort, and luxury...so I\\'m keeping it. Quattro Handling with sleek security Noone gets hurt in this car.  I have \\rhad two accidents in this car and all \\rpassengers (3 first accident, and 2 the \\rother) walked without a bruise or a \\rscratch.  Of course, I took car to \\rL.A.\\'s finest Euro repair shop (Avio \\rCoach Craft). Additionally, the twin \\rturbos\\' really launch this car. If \\rowners have a problem with the \\rmaintenance, maybe they should invest \\rtheir money in other areas>like an \\rextended warranty, which will be about \\r1/3 of all the repairs, and upkeep of a \\rhigh performance, luxury car(believe me \\rI checked).  This forced induction car \\rhas endless possibilities of upgrades! \\rGreat as a used car as well. The Car I Thought I  Always Wanted The 2.7t in a word: amazing.  \\rConnection to the road: excellent. \\rCabin: very nice. As my lease comes to \\ran end, I am pleased to say so long to \\rmy \\x93dream car\\x94.  My problem?  \\rMaintenance! When the Audi Advantage \\rplan ends prepare to pay.  My car has \\rspent weeks in the shop; driver seat, \\rdashboard lights, and brake pads all \\rreplaced. Plastic pieces broken turbo \\rpieces cracked and it seems both the \\rcheck engine or airbag light is on. The \\rnewest problem is sounding like a \\rserious suspension problem. These \\rproblems could be attributed to \\rdemanding driving, but most of the time \\rthis car is simply a commuter. Choose \\rthis car be advised of a high \\rmaintenance bill! Best yet Last 3 years I had a lexus GS300 BMW \\r330 and now this, this is the yet. and \\rI will get a 2005 for my wife next year. Used Buyer Beware After almost 4 years, I will soon be \\rrid of this vehicle, as I will not \\rpurchase it at the end of lease.The car \\rhas spent more than 7 weeks in the \\rdealer service department (this does \\rnot count 1 day trips). The dealer has \\rbeen quite helpful, but after 3 \\rcomputers, new coils, injectors, driver \\rwindow, 3 catalytic convertors, and \\rother assorted bits, I will say goodbye. Fantastic Vehicle - Highly Recommend We have been very pleased with this \\rpurchase. We test drove a Lexus GS300, \\rBMW 328i, Acura TSX, and Infiniti I30t. \\rThe Audi was the best value: great \\rprice and awesome set of features. Who \\rwould pay 5k more for an inferior \\rvehicle (GS300, 328i). For some reason \\rpre-owned Audis are a great buy in the \\rAtlanta area (well below blue book and \\rEdmund\\'s TMV). Loosens up & too expensive to maintain! We are faced with putting $5K of \\'routine\\' \\rmaintenance into this disappointing ride.  \\rTurbos clogged, oil leaks, suspension \\rproblems, etc.  It was billed to us as a family \\rsedan w/ some pick-up-and-go.  I had no \\ridea it would be more expensive to fix than a \\rporsche.  Next time, I\\'ll just buy one of those \\rinstead.  Also, the car drives much looser \\rnow, compared to my E320 Benz.  Audi can \\rkeep its line of products for  the gear heads. Great balance of power security and fun After trading in a lexus gs300, I \\rcouldn\\'t wait for the first snowfall.  \\rThe salesperson told me not to bother \\rgetting snow tire - he gave me his \\rcell number and told me he come and \\rpush my car if it ever got stuck.  \\rHe\\'s was right.  I get great \\rpeformance and no white knuckles in \\rthe chicago winter. Finally! A car that exceeds expectations I have owned a Benz (1998 E320), \\rCorvettes, Olds\\' Aurora, ... but this \\ris the nicest car I\\'ve ever had. \\rA \\'vette is a \\'vette (tight/sporty), \\rbut this car handles better than the \\rBenz and was more reliable than any of \\rthe 10+ new cars I have purchased.  \\rWe\\'re buying a 2004 A6! Love my Audi Not since my 89 Acura Legend have I \\rdriven a car theat cost me so little \\rin repairs.  The car has been \\rcompletely reliable, so much so I \\rfully expect to get the next version \\rA6 when it comes out in 2004. No Complaints I have owned SAABs, Volvos, MBs and \\rBMWs, but this is the finest \\rautomobile I have ever owned. A couple \\rof problems in the beginning, but AUDI \\rfixed with no hesitations (including \\rreplacing brake pads at 14K and entire \\rclutch assembly).   My 1st Audi; there will be more Comming to the end of a 3 yr lease, \\rthis was my 1st Audi.  When I got it I \\rchose it over the Mercedes E400 with \\rall wheel drive because it met or \\rexceeded that car feature for feature, \\rhad much better acceleration, and had \\rthe design/feel of a sports car vs. \\ra \\'sedan\\'.  Every button is where it \\rshould be.  I actually like the \\rsimplified navigation system (taking \\rroute a turn at a time) as opposed to \\rother \\'digital map\\' implementations.  \\rI never expected extra convienences \\rlike fold down rear seats to expand \\rtrunk space.  Pure fun to drive alone, \\ror chaufering others. Scare the kids with this powerfull V8 I bought this car used with 7000 miles \\ron it at the audi dealership,  audi \\rassured warranty gives me peace of \\rmind.  The ride is great overall,  \\rsuper responsive,  smooth,  fast,  but \\rwith the standard 16\" wheels,  handling \\ris a bit spungy,  I upgraded to 18\" rs4 \\rwheels w/ bridgetone potenza s-03 pole \\rposition tires  (great tires for this \\rcar,  though I\\'d get lighter wheels if \\rI do this again.  Actually I would buy \\rthis car only with the sport package,  \\ras the standard seats don\\'t provide \\radequate support,  especially for the \\rpassengers.  The kids love the car (we \\rhave 2 and actually like having two \\rsculpted seats in the back). Fantastic Vehicle Looked at several vehicles when  Better than a Camry and even a MBE320! Looking to replace our 1993 Camry, we \\rlooked at five different vehicles--\\rToyota, Honda, Nissan, Mercedes Benz, \\rand VW.  The Audi A6 has the best \\rinterior bar none; I was extremely \\rdisappointed with the MB--they are \\rselling status or prestige, but not \\rquality.  The VW is a close second, \\rbut has unresolved reliability issues, \\rbut the body is similar to the Audi, \\rof course.  Only problem within 30days \\rwas a HID xenon headlamp which was \\rreplaced under manufacturer\\'s \\rwarranty.  Otherwise, what a wonderful \\rcar... Audi Surprising Satisfaction When I purchased the Audi, I had \\rdriven a reliably Chevy Tahoe for \\rthree years to recover from a Lemon \\rLexus...  I have been incredibly \\rsatisfied by my purchase of a dealer \\rdemonstrator.  This car is the most \\rexciting drive:  it combines superb \\rroad feel with precise handling in a \\rluxury envelope.  In one day, I\\'ve \\rdriven 700 miles in my A6 \\rcomfortably.  So good, my best friend \\rbought one just like it!

I \\rexpected to confirm 540 supremacy - wrong!\\r The A6 shocked me - beautiful & polished; \\rsolid feel from the door handle to the wheel;  \\rpowerful, lusty V8; smooth & confident pedal \\rresponse and a \"one-ness\" not found in the \\rBMW. \\r I knew the quattro would have an advantage \\rin snow & ice, I didn\\'t expect the significant \\rdifference on wet, gravel, sandy roads, or \\reven uphill turning acceleration.  \\r The 540 is an awesome car on a clear dry \\rday, but for an everyday sports sedan there \\ris no comparison.  To all you unfortunate use car buyers I bought my A6 few years ago. 05 so old as dirt. But I have to say who ever owned this one before me took care of it. Sure there is some sun damage from trips to Arizona at least that\\'s what the maps indicate under the seat. But considering it has over 140 000 miles on it at this point the car drives and handles absolutely amazing. Maybe little slow on take off, but it is 13 years old and no super charger under the hood here. Love it. One of the best used cars i have ever bought Read before you consider buying* I have owned my 2005 Audi A6 Quattro for almost a year now and have have problem after problem. From a rear-end differential to a 2,000 dollar steering module just to start the car even though there were no problems mechanically. I caution you if you’re thinking about buying a used Audi A6 to keep thinking and move on because this car will nickel and dime you until you can’t afford to fix it anymore. great ride if you dont mind spending for it Nice looking car great design, poor quality materials. From headlight, abs module, air bag module, trac control, skipping CD player, to break light failure it has lots of electrical problems. Not much mechanical problems, but some structural noises. Joy to drive, pain to spend needlessly for repairs We have had our 2005 Audi A6 3.2 for about two years and bought it with about 106,000 miles. This car is a great looking car and very fun to drive, but none of that matters when reliability is an issue. I can honestly say that unless I win the next mega lottery I am never buying another Audi.Now before you dismiss me as a hater I want you to know I really wanted to love this car. I like German engineered cars. I had a few BMWs before and liked those, and my wife had a 2000 Audi S4 for a couple years that was also a fun car, but had maintenance issues that should have warned us from buying another Audi. We had an extended aftermarket warranty on that car though, so I guess that helped us \"forget\" about the issues.Right from the get go the A6 was trouble. When accelerating from stop signs there was a drastic delay before the car would shift into gear and start moving - you would push the accelerator and nothing would happen for a couple beats and then it would suddenly take off. I finally learned that if I kept the car in sport mode that didn\\'t happen. Sport mode is fun so I didn\\'t mind too much, but my MPG suffered. After returning the car to the dealer I bought it from a couple time they still couldn\\'t fix the problem and offered to put a new transmission in for $1,200. After agreeing to that I soon discovered that did nothing to fixed the problem!That set the tone for a trend that continued throughout ownership. Every four months or so an issue would pop up that required a trip to the local Audi dealer for repairs. I started to joke with people that a trip to the dealer was always followed with at least $500 in repairs.The icing of the cake though occurred last week when we brought the car in for a failed battery. At this point we have 123,000 miles on the odometer and we asked them to change the oil as well. Then we got a phone call from the dealer saying that the timing chain was stretched and the car sounded terrible. They would recommend we don\\'t drive it but have it towed if we want a second opinion. The repair would cost $5,000!! And that was just to repair one of four chains in the engine. To repair all four the cost would be $8,000. That was just the repair of the timing chains and there was no guarantee that more damage wasn\\'t caused to the engine when the timing chain broke.Now after reading some forums and talking to some repair shops I have learned that this is fairly common with Audis of this time period. Apparently Audi went to the timing chain versus timing belt set up starting in 2005 and the new chain system trends towards failure on a good percentage of the cars between 110,000 and 150,000 miles. Now some people may say that is is a common result of neglected maintenance. I can tell you I was current on all of my oil changes and service. I can\\'t say what the history of the car was before I bought it, but this drastic problem with a ridiculous repair price tag is unacceptable. If you look up the value of my car, this repair costs more that the car is worth at this point.So although I typically don\\'t write reviews, I felt obligated to share my experience in hope that I can save some other car buyer from the same fate. The dealer was useless and offered no assistance with this major repair even though THEY broke the car while it was in their shop. This is one of the big Audi dealers in the Twin Cities. In the end I sold the car for $2,500 as is, even though I still owed $7,500 on the loan so I got to pay off the remaining $5k for nothing. Do yourself a favor and buy BMW or Mercedes if you want a high end German brand, or go with Lexus. Awesome First Car My father and I went a purchases this car at an auction. The car has been very great to me, we bought it in August 2014 with 130k miles. I\\'ve been in a car accident with it in which I rearended a much larger vehicle at 45 MPH. Luckily I was super safe and I just had to replace the front bumper. The car has about 145k miles on it currently and it just seems to be falling apart. Plastic pieces in the exterior, the window regulator not working correctly and some oil leaking. It has been a very nice car and I am looking for a newer mode with less miles because I feel so safe in it. Also last note the quattro all wheel drive is amazing, you never feel like you don\\'t have traction A real gem; a GREAT used bargain! My 4th Audi and 1st bot with less than 100K on speedo. Bot used on eBay in 08 with 28K; two problems under warranty. Problem free ever since\\x97now 65K on odo. Amazing engineering, ergonomics, design, performance & great fuel mileage for a V8, hiway\\x9728mpg @ 70mph. Has Bose, performance pkg, with 18s. 0-60 mph in 6 sec., great handling for a luxury car. I would HIGHLY recommend this car, especially with the 4.2L V8. Just bought an \\'01 A6 Avant yesterday for my fiancé; a rare, low-mileage car that looks brand new. Will keep both for years. Of the 5 Audis I have owned only 1 has given me problems, and frankly, I bot it with over 100K on it and expected many of the issues. Will own Audis forever! 2005 Audi A6 C6 3.2Q Sport Package Purchased used 2010 with 47,000 miles and now has about 67,000 a year later.Beautiful car both inside and out, and you find that new models (2010+) have copied the styling cues (Jaguar XF, Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata and must recently the Volvo S60).That says much for the overall exterior design and impact.The interior is fantastic, as well as the engine/drivetrain.I would buy another used, especially if Certified Pre-Owned, but the new prices are rediculous. As Safe As They Say I bought a 2005 A6 in 2007, had it 2.5 years, then was rear-ended on a stopped off-ramp by another driver who was going over 60 miles per hour.A 4000 lb car was spun 180 degrees, slid across 2 lanes, down a hill, and over a concrete drain.The car was totaled but I walked away.All 4 doors on the car still worked although the rears were no longer aligned.The car only had minor problems up until it was killed.One LED that went out intermittently.Service, brakes, tires, were about asusual on a euro sedan.Definitely a high speed cruiser but can handle turns very well.Interior quality so much better than BMW.It\\'s a great car.I\\'m buying another, probably an 07 or 08. Love this Car I have owned my A6 for 5.5 years and still enjoy it every time I get behind the wheel.  Handles great and fun to drive.   The overall quality of the car is very nice.  My biggest complaint is the low profile tires.  I have spent close to $5,000 on tires since I owned the car.  They are good for about 25k miles and the pinch easily.  I will admit Most of the issues were caused by me (first time owner of low profiles).  I love the way the car handles but not sure my next car will include low profiles. Audi quality i just bought this car and it runs smoothly and is a gas saver. the only problem i have is that i cant turn off the dual climate control.  Excellent First Car After reading reviews about the A6 having a lot of electrical problems with the MMI system I was very hesitant to buy. However, this was not the case. The car handles unbelievably around corners and has great gas mileage.(I get around 250 mi-300 mi city and close to 400 on highway. Overall the car is stunning both inside and out and I would highly recommend this car. The only downside with this car is that repairs are expensive and most of the time the part must be directly ordered through Germany, so it may take longer than anticipated for your car to be fixed. Love My A6 4.2L S-Line I bought this car used with only 7,800 miles. Love the smooth power and fit and finish. Ride is a little rough with the S-Line but on good roads the tracking and traction outweigh that. Interior is what got me over BMW - BMW interiors are boring. I just feel special driving it. Late starting I have the same problem the first gentleman that wrote his report on the first page.  The car starts but sometimes 1/10 starts it takes roughly 4 seconds.  The dealer has changed the fuel pump cleaned the carburetors and still has that exact problem.  They then told me that fuel pump was 25 percent efficient that\\'s why it was replaced.  They then took it again and check it online with Germany and said intake manifold.  The part was replaced but the problem is still there. Love to Drive I have owned my A6 for four years and 70k miles.  Problems: 1. Trunk latch needed replacing at 10k. 2. Push button start would not work at 30k but only needed a software update. 3. Brake pads replaced twice and rotors once. 4. back up sensors stopped working at 53k just after warranty expired.  5. Something is rattling in the door at 75k and will have it checked out.  I have low profile, performance tires and need to replace at each 25k.  However, I have had to replace five tires due to damage.  That\\'s all the bad.  The good is that the car is very attractive, solid and drives great.  Lots of fun.  Overall, I am very happy with the car would recommend it to anyone. World-Class Luxury I bought my A6 with 23000 miles in Nov. 08. Have never regretted it. Previously owned a 1998 A6. Wow, what a difference in performance and ride. The MMI system took some getting used to but is no problem once you figure out the logic behind it.  I have had only one problem so far -- the memory for the seat and mirror settings was not working. It was a software problem that was fixed by the dealer under warranty.  The handling of the vehicle is superb. Acceleration is smooth and very responsive. Surprisingly, the fuel economy on the highway is also very good for vehicle this size. In my trip to work (21 miles with 90% highway and 10% local), I typically get between 27 and 28 mpg. Local is 19. Very happy with a few exceptions I bought this car CPO (22k miles, nav, premium, convenience pkgs, parktronic, etc for $30.2). So far, it has been a joy to drive.  I came from a 02 330i that I loved very much as I needed more room/AWD. For sure this is a very different car - less sport, more luxury as you would expect. Smooth ride, solid feeling and great looks/design. A bit disappointed in that there are some creaks and rattles (spoiled again by my 330i which was drum tight after 56k) An absolute blast to drive! I purchased my Audi with reservations. My research revealed that customer service was awful (not true) - and that I would have endless problems, especially with oil leaks. I did have a rear cam leak, under warranty, and the dealer took care of it right away. It is a beautiful car, inside and out. It feels like you\\'re in a cockpit. Took a bit to learn how to work the MMI system, but once I did, it all made sense. Controls are extremely driver friendly, and for low profile tires (traded 18\" high performance for 17\" all purpose tires - big difference), it is a surprisingly smooth ride.  She handles and responds beautifully. This car is an absolute blast to drive. I couldn\\'t be happier! I love my CPO A6 4.2 Bought car CPO from a dealer. Used to own a 2004 A4 3.0 Quattro and fell in love after test driving the A6. Although used, general build quality is great and car drives smooth Audi 2005 A6 Great build quality, looks, and performance for a midsize sedan. Not very good service In 3 years this car has not had any big issues until recently.  Since the dealer replaced a \\'recall\\' part of a fuel filter or pump, the car periodically does not start.  Eventually it does (I haven\\'t had to be towed yet).  It has been in repair regularly since October and they say it is not replicating what I describe.  After several attempts at this, the dealer now has called in a \\'special engineer\\' to work on my car.  I am now driving a low budget A4 loaner as the dealer still has my car and has not returned any of my calls.  Audi USA service is just as unresponsive and very robotic with all of their responses.  They are of no help. Best in class This is my first Audi and am happy! Very refined interior, lots of features but not gimmicky. Excellent ride and quattro is amazing. Little roll in corners, excellent brakes and pick up. 30 mpg on highways and can take regular fuel if pushed. Nice looking exterior though the grill stands out. Though I\\'m on my 3rd read of the manual, the MMI is generally intuitive and you can get the basics without reading anything. Generally, a great performing car with excellent road manners.  Is sporty, quiet, elegant, frugal, refined and satisfying.  I like just sitting in it and my family too.  Buy anything else! I bought an A6 CPO vehicle last May thinking that I was buying a premium vehicle and a premium dealer experience.  Wrong on both accounts.  In the first 6 months my car was at the dealer\\'s service department for 30 days total with not much to show except more frustration and gray hair than I would have liked.  The car drives and handles like a dream, however, the cacophony of squeaks, groans, creaks and rattles from the interior is enough to drive a sane man to insanity! Audi 05 Rocks! Love the car.  Not one problem except for the tires which I had to replace at 25k miles (bummer!). 47,000 Miles My Last Audi ? This is my second Audi, I had an A4 3.0 Quattro that I just loved. While I had several issues with the A4 (failed ignition coils & cam pulley came loose), I still decided to buy the A6. I have had nearly as many quality and dependability issues since purchased. The most disappointing is a hesitation upon first drive of the day. I gave the dealer 4 tries before contacting Audi US. Still not fixed, so I will get rid of it in the fall. This car is beautiful inside and out. It is very difficult to drive smoothly, the steering is overboosted. I have always wished you could dial it down using MMI, why not, it is electronic? Speaking of MMI, simple and works great. Love this car! This is my second Audi. First was a 2002 A6 2.7t which I really liked. This new A6 is even better. I was leaning towards the Infiniti M35x, tried one with 12,000 miles on it, I\\'d rather keep my 2002 Audi. I\\'m glad I found this 4.2. I immediately knew this was the car for me. I also tried the Acura RL and didn\\'t think much of it. Nice car, just not as good as the Audi. Purchased mine used with the sport pkg, advanced key, bose stereo, navi, and can\\'t say enough about it. I\\'ll average around 22 actual MPG. Excellent mileage for a 335 HP V8. We\\'re now going to purchase a A4 for my wife. Amazing car! Wonderful Car Absolutely fun to drive. Handles very well and has excellent gas mileage for the size and horsepower of the vehicle. No problems with the car except for trunk latch had to be replaced. Exterior and interior designs are the best I have seen. A wonderful car to travel in... little driver fatigue on long trips as it is very comfortable to sit in. Not So Sweet I bought this car and drove off the lot with a huge smile. The smile has turned to tears. This car was the biggest mistake I have ever made. Audi is a nightmare to deal with. I have had numerous problems with the electrical system. One thing after another. They were all safety issues and made the car undrivable. There were also issues with the Sirius radio, blue tooth, speakers, airbag, and more. I am not sure if it is just my car but I am going to assume that it is. My car has been in the shop over 30 days in the last 6 months. Audi really does not care. I would never buy another. Dont buy an Audi This car was great the first 12 months. I have had numerous problems with the car, the dealer and Audi NA. I would not recommend that anyone buy an Audi. The car is very unreliable and not worth the money. Parts are never in stock and service is a joke. I think I will be going to a Lexus from here. There are some good features but the are all overshadowed by Audi business practices. Great Fun to Drive The A6 is extremely fun to drive.  There really aren\\'t many negatives.  One thing I noticed is that there are some interior pieces that started to \"fall apart\", such as the rear view mirror came disconnected, the panel on the driver\\'s side came loose, and finally the A6 symbol on the back of the car broke.  All this was easily replaced at no charge with their excellent service package that comes with the car (even if you buy it used).  Positives: definitely a unique car, even in a big city like Chicago, fun to drive, the quattro is felt, especially in the snow when all those BMWs are slipping in the snow due to their rear-wheel drive and the room in the back is unreal. 2005 Audi A6 Q Except for a trunk latch and a cd player replacement, no problems at all. This is my fourth Audi and it\\'s simply as good and reliable as my last two lexuses, but they handle like true german performance cars. Also nothing can compete with quattro in bad weather. We live in so Fla and still love the quattro in the rains we get here. A6 unreliable Audi A6 drives beautifully when it works, but is very unreliable.  Have had my A6 serviced for same problem of all of a sudden shutting down and not accelerating properly 5 times in last 3 months.  EPS computer fault system continues to fail.  At times won\\'t change gears properly. Buyer beware, and Audi no longer offers free service.  Audi so far is refusing to replace the vehicle despite servicing it 3 times for these same issue in last 3 weeks.  If you like taking your car to the dealership for service a lot, this may be your car. Audi not what I thought it would be Bought the 3.2 A6 a year ago and have been relatively pleased.  Gas mileage and drive comfort have been good, and the car looks beautiful.  Now the down side:  I had a squeak in the rear passenger door that took the dealer 1 year to fix.  No kidding.  Odd issues with the electrical system have lead me to ask if I really bought an Audi.  I always expected them to be top notch on fit and finish and they just missed the mark on this specific car.  Wish others the best of luck.  A Bum Rap     The new A6 is a great car.  I did have one major electrical/computer melt- down - tow to dealer, then a few weeks (with an \\'06 A6 loaner) for the non- responsive ignition to be corrected, but all is fine since.  This car gets about 30 mpg on the highway! I have wanted a \"big\" hybrid (sick of hearing about the small trunks, though).  I need my cavernous A6 trunk for clubs (4 sets with the drivers and 3-woods out and criss-crossed atop) and other things.     Don\\'t buy any other mid-size until you drive this fun, fast and fuel efficient car. Tomm 10+ for WOW Factor!! This is one great car. I was looking for the All Wheel Drive security blanket and after road testing AWD competitors I was about to give up when I found this beauty and immediately went for a test drive.  I have never driven an Audi before and was not to sure what to expect.  The A6 took off very smoothly but with a firm press of the gas pedal it launched like a rocket.  I felt a sense of security in the stiffness of the body when taking some tight turns and the response of the steering was right on the money.  Being a die hard Subaru owner for over 20 years it was hard to give into German engineering but needless to say I am completely sold on this car.  So long BMW!!! After driving 8 BMW\\'s in my life, I finally had to admit that the 5 series interior is just getting too cramped for 4 people to ride in comfortably.  I looked at the A6 and was SO impressed with the handling, the fit and finish and the power that I never even went back to the BMW dealer. I DID compare the car with the Lexus GS, but the road feel of the Lexus doesn\\'t come close to that of the Audi. This car rocks! Best  A6 Ever Audi redid the A6 last year and made massive improvements.  The A6 I leased in \\'99 was underpowered and should have been a 3.0 rather than 2.4. Consequently, I switched to a Mercedes E320 4-matic and thought I would never drive another Audi again.  However, the E350 that replaced the E320 is just awful, so I tried the redesigned A6 and fell in love all over again.  My 2005 Audi A6 3.0 has all the power it needs and is beautifully designed, inside and outside.  But most importantly, it handles with the precision and nimbleness I expect from a Quattro, especially in the rain.   I\\'m not sorry I bought it, but.... I like the performance and reliability of this car. Handling and responsiveness is excellent.  The outside styling is fair, and believe it contributes to a reduced visibility/window view through the windshield, as it is now canted at a very aerodynamic/rakish angle. I would have preferred more glass at a more upright angle. The trunk is adequate but deep and overly narrow when comparing it to the BMW 500 series. The ride on the mandatory 17\" wheels (4.2 engine) is a bit too stiff for my taste.  I would have preferred regular 16\" higher profile tires.  Purchased NEW 2005 A6 - January 2006 Formerly owned a 2001 A6, and after buying a 2005.5 A4 for my wife, I spent hundreds of hours researching/driving. After driving every car I knew, I wanted the new A6. The A6 was the finest interior/exterior/engine combo I had ever driven, I purchased a 2005 A6 3.2 AWD with Bose, Sunshades, Tan leather, 17\" custom wheels, Premium Pkg., Tech. Pkg without Nav. Adding Nav for $1400 next week.  What a car.  For me it is PERFECT! Very nice Great car. Handles and drives really well. I went from a 330i to this and am really impressed. It\\'s a lot bigger, but doesn\\'t drive as big. Great car! This is the best car I\\'ve ever owned, it is hard to keep it under 70 mph and 100 mph feels like 60 in other cars. Quality has been terrific, the navigation works extremely well, and the sound system is great as well. I bought the V6, and other than a rare occasional need for more snap I think I made the right choice. The gas mileage in and around the city averages about 20mpg.  Mid-Life Crisis Aversion Mobile Audi is really running circles around its competitors with this awesome car!  I still have not tired of finding any excuse to take the A6 3.2 for a drive.  Light steering, quiet and comfortable ride around town make it feel like a limo in L.A. traffic.  Step on the gas on PCH or the 5 Freeway north to San Francisco and try staying under the speed limit.  This car is a joy to drive.  It\\'s very powerful and responsive when you need it.  At all times, it\\'s controlled power in a car that feels substantial and safe.  Driving through a torrential rainstorm to San Francisco, we felt in complete control.  Plenty of power in a crisis, like the time we chased a road- rager at 100 uphill. Wonderful Saloon This is a beautifully executed automobile- I looked at the 545i Sport and the E-500 4Matic, but the A6 4.2 just blew the competition away. It has the most jewel- like interior of the bunch, the best, most timeless style, and the most comfortable cruising, yet slightly hard-edged, performance. Great features- nice extras like power start and electric glovebox, and wonderful navigation and MMI systems. 10,000 miles later I look for reasons to drive. This is the first sedan I\\'ve owned in 12 years always having driven SUV\\'s during that period. My previous was the Infiniti FX 45 AWD. This car is quick, comfortable, civilized and elegant. Excellent handing and very good in the snow. The trans is smooth as silk. Fit and finish are top notch.  Wonder improvement I had a 2004 A6 and traded it for a 2005.  The ride is vastly improved, as is the comfort and amenities.  The gadgetry takes a little getting used to, but is well worth it.  No complaints whatsoever.  More money - more car Going from a 2002 A6 to a 2005 induces sticker shock. The sticker shock is over quickly, but the fun remains. The car has a bigger feel than the 2002, but the handling is better. The navigation system is terrific if you take the time to learn it and keep at it.  But be careful not to get preoccupied with the nav system and forget about driving - it is easy to forget to keep your eyes on the road and not the screen.  Acceleration is much better than the previous 3.0 - ride is much stiffer now - great \"feel\" for the road, but the passengers will have to acclimate if they are accustomed to a soft ride.  Large trunk - smaller opening than the 2002. A great car that is fun to drive. Sweet Ride This is a beautiful car inside and out!  I decided on the A6 over the Benz E-350 and BMW 525i.  The interior is absolutely beautiful and comfortable.  When you\\'re in the drivers seat, it feels like you\\'re in a cockpit of an airplane, but still very comfortable.  The leg room in back is really comfortabe for any two adults, and can accomodate 3 children (as we have) fairly comfortable.  I love the new exterior styling for 2005, it has a much sportier look.  Audi has definitely caught up to M-B and BMW with car, and in my opinion have passed them, epecially since my car was about $8,000 less (with Quattro) than a comparably optioned M-B and BMW. 5th Audi and still loving them... This is my 5th Audi (93 100, 2000 A6, 2002 A6, 2004 A4 Cabriolet) and by far the best in performance, control and design. The \\'lag\\' many speak of, lessens after 3000 miles or so on the car. Minus a few dashboard squeaks and one airbag issue at delivery, this car is flawless. Audi has always been a standout among other German brands in term of quality, interior design and never \\'blends\\' in to the crowd of so many other boring vehicles. Being a loyal owner also means putting up with the little \\'annoyances\\' that you have to expect from Audi. Great Car, Great Engine, Good Mileage  I bought an A6L which is more than 3.7 inches longer inside (only available in China). It comes with a 2 litre fsi turbo engine with 170hp and 280nm of torque from 1800 - 4200 rpm. with a 6 spd manual gearbox. Its a great car inside and out. The award winning engine is very responsive, good low end torque and efficient (30mpg), no turbo lag. It has great headroom and legroom. MMI is easy to use. Vision is good all round. Build quality is up there. Steering is quick and accurate as it is not as nose heavy as larger engines. Ride is comfortable. Its USD 22K cheaper than a BMW 525i so its no brainer. Very impressed. My 1st Audi. A6 Its just fun to drive has perfect comfort, performance, safety, reliability and perfect styling. What more could you ask for. It is what I expected First off, the look is stunning. Loved the look at first site. However, I was weary of Audi\\'s reputation having owned one (\\'84 Audi 5000s turbo) as my very first car. Needless to say, I did my research before buying the 2005 A6. I\\'ve had it for 10 months now, and already I\\'ve put 30,000 miles on it. It rides so smoothly. My only complaint is the DVD nav in that it\\'s not accurate at times (it\\'s rare). Telling me a gas station is a block away when there isn\\'t one. When driving in \"D\" there\\'s a little lag. But if you shift it to \"S\", no gap in acceleration. YOU ARE FLYING. Handling is superb. I got the A6 V6 almost fully loaded. The 18\" wheels feels the road like barefoot. Excellent braking.  My 3rd Audi and still satisfying This is my 3rd Audi A6 - 1999, 2003 and now 2005.  What a car!  Simply gorgeous to look at, both from inside and outside.  MMI is a great feature.  I\\'ve compared with BMW\\'s I-drive (what a joke!) and it\\'s simply beyond comparison. Other owners have noted the hesitation on 1st & 2nd gears and I have notice that as well.  I wonder why Audi decided to part with CVT. Simply best exterior and interior design, great sound system and absolute joy to drive on winding roads.  Looking forward to more Audis in the future. 2005 Audi A6 4.2 Took delivery of 2005 A6 4.2 last fall.  To date, there has not been one problem.  The sport suspension is quite stiff with the 40 series tires.  The engine is strong.  My mileage is a mixture of highway city averages about 22 MPG every week.  A No Brainer!!! Like everyone else here, I was looking for a luxury, mid-sized sedan. I considered the Infiniti-M35, the Mercedes E class and the BMW 5-series, however threw it out quickly because of the new design.  Looks cheap.  The A6 is luxury throughout, is a head- turner and performs great.  First gear hesitates slightly, but the rest of the gears leave little to be desired. Overall acceleration is terrific. Considering the price was $10k less than BMW/Mercedes and $5 less than the Infiniti, it was a no brainer.  For all the negative press I\\'ve read about the MMI, don\\'t believe the hype, it\\'s a great feature, extremely easy to use and not a distraction at all.  Audi wins a new fan!! needs better attention to details This is really a great car spoiled by a few problems, the throttle response in stop and go traffic is horrible, the brakes grab and the car has more rattles than a baby. On the plus side a great ride with outstanding fuel economy. I purchased a fully loaded 6 rather than the 8 with fewer options and 6 is just fine. Overall the execution is ok, however for the money the E320 is the better option as Audi missed a few easy to fix issues Oh what a feeling... I\\'m fortunate to live and work in Germany so I can occassionally unleash the A6\\'s full potential on the autobahn. At 135 MPH (speed governed) it rides like it\\'s painted on the road.  Smooth as silk with no vibrations or nervousness (except from my passengers).  Servotronic keeps steering input moderated and, if needed I can stop on a dime if a wayward Opel pulls into the left lane.  I wish all A6 owners had the opportunity to wring out the German engineering that went into this car on the autobahn.  They would be doubly impressed with their Audi.  Besides the high speed performance, I\\'m impressed with its quality.  After 8000 plus miles, not one problem (except that darn speed governor!).  Great Car !! We absolutely love it and this is our second Audi. Drove to Vegas from the Bay Area and the car performed very well considering the extreme desert heat(116 degrees).Could use more horsepower but i\\'m satisfied with it..Great gas mileage. Worth The Wait! 1040 miles on my new 4.2 and not a single flaw.  Exceptionally quiet and a smoother ride than what I\\'ve read in various reviews.  The car is fun to drive and the $9K extra for the 4.2 may just be worth the extra sizzle in performance.  I ordered all the options, including the solor sun roof which works well during these recent hot and dry triple digit Nevada summer days.  I too switched from a 2005 5 Series BMW purchase order after taking a last minute visit to the Audi store.  Fit, finish, ride all helped to change my mind.  Quattro is a must during those long Lake Tahoe winters, something BMW is still trying to perfect. Really Nice Car Wonderful car to look at and drive. Lots of nice touches and an interior that is beautiful. It cruises really nice on the road -- have to be careful and watch how fast you really are going. 3rd Audi & love this the best by far Wanted an \\'04 A8L and \"settled\" for an \\'05 A6 and I\\'m very glad I did.  Black/Amaretto combo is beautiful and the interior looks (and acts) nearly as big as an A8 ... but not quite.  Great highway cruiser! A new Audi fan! I was in the market for a new mid-size luxury car: as others who have posted, I had my mind set on a BMW 5 series.  I had a friend recommend I take a look at the A6 before purchasing my BMW and I\\'m glad I did.  From its supple luxurious interior to the many gadgets (advanced key, MMI and Bluetooth capability), this car has truly been everything I\\x92ve ever wanted in a car (and more).  After performing extensive research, I found that the A6 was definitely the best car for the money, particularly when a comparably equipped BMW 5 series and Mercedes Benz E-class could easily cost you an extra $7 - $10k. Audi A6, \\'Awesome Car\\' I\\'ve owned my car 3 mos and I\\'ve never been more pleased with any car before. Lots of power, sure-footed as a cat, sexy lines, smooth as silk, fabulously rich interior, and a head turner. What more can I say; I haven\\'t gotten this much car attention since my Plymouth Prowler. And I\\'ve had 2 M/Bnzs, a Jag, a Lexus, 2 BMW\\'s, a Vette, a Miata and a few pick-ups & SUV\\'s. I sorta wish I\\'d gotten the 4.2 V8, but decided the 3.2 V6 was powerful enough. Besides, I could spend the extra $9k on a cruise and some clothes. My car is one major conversation piece.  If you really check it out, you to will love it and become an \\'AUDIPHILE\\'. This car rocks My 05 4.2 is a great car. It accelerates and handles extremely well. Though the gas mileage is rather low and the 18\" tires give it a harsh ride.  It is alot of fun in the snow. I find myself looking for hills to go up.  The swivel headlights make night driving a snap. The solar sunroof keeps the car cool in summer and warm in winter. The advanced key means that I never have to look for my keys. The voice recognition and bluetooth make cell calls easy. Though the MMI can be a little imposing at first. The satelite radio is a must. My children love the television monitors in the headrests, the heated rear seats and rear window shades. My wife and I love the safety of rear airbags. 2005 A6 3.2 Car rides wonderfully.  Much better performance then the old model.  MMI is a breeze to use and enjoyable creature comforts I test drove the BMW 530xi series looking for all wheel drive to navigate colorado weather. I had my heart set and even put down a deposit to reserve the in-demand car. Then I decided to test drive the audi A6 to find out why every other car on the road in Boulder is an audi. Let\\'s just say I drove away from the dealer in an 05 A6. The main reason I chose the A6 over the 530xi was the interior comfort of the car. It is truly luxurious as opposed to the stripped down beamer interior.  The power is nice but nothing to write home about but the accomadations (mmi, nav, voice control, audio) make one feel like very executive. First 2000 mile impressions The car is a joy to drive. Has a lot of power and the \"Sport\" mode on the trans is great. I love the new aggressive looking front and the understated elegance of its syle. The interior is as close to perfect that I can think of. No rattles or noise. The MMI takes a bit of learning to master but once done is intuitive. The premium sound system is so good that I almost hate to get out of the car while listening. I actually wish I had a longer commute. I don\\'t like the absence of body side mouldings for protection from the inevitable dings so I installed aftermarket ones. The voice commands and Bluetooth feature as well as the DVD Nav system are great fun. The Nav system is excellent. Great Redesign This is my second Audi and I love it! It is a sheer pleasure to drive, handles in snow with aplomb, has styling that turns heads, and the interior; wow!  So far this car has exceeded my expectations in a newly designed car from the ground up.  I will definitely buy Audi again. best of its class The new A6 Drives like a Dream. The comfort level is very high. Looks are great. Great handling in the rain Amazing Quality I have had my 3.2 A6 for 3 months now and have never been back to the dealer, not once. There has not been one single thing that needed repair or adjusting. My Blackberry 7100T works perfectly with the exception of downloading the phone list and took 3 minutes to pair. I love how I can be on the phone and start the car and it switches seamlessly over to speaker. Once you get used to the MMI, it works great... even the voice recognition. Ride, handling, transmission, A/C, stereo and nav are wonderful. The interior is much better quality than BMW or Mercedes. People compliment me frequently on the cars beauty. Audi is the new standard in German luxury. Buyer Beware I made the mistake of buying the A6 with the V8 and the Sports Suspension.  This car is better with standard suspension and all season tires for sure.  The combo I bought makes the car ride way too stiff.  Also - the outside temp indicator randomly malfunctions and reads 15-20 degress lower than the temp really is.  Seems that this is occuring when the A/C is on.  Dealer refuses to do anything because it doesn\\'t happen when they have the car.  The automatic transmission is the worst I have ever driven - it switches way to fast when starting from a stop.   THere is no vent only setting on the climate control - I have never heard of such a thing!! Total Package The car is great to drive..lots of power and the interior is flawless. The premium sound system is the best I\\'ve experienced in a stock OEM unit. The CD changer is poorly placed in the glove compartmenbt with no in dash CD player. The Tiptronic and sport modes for the trans are fun. The car, however, looks like ten thousand others and is undistinguished. Smooth, quick and elegant. I love getting into it each morning and am sorry to leave it. Power steering is a tad too light and brakes a bit too touchy. love the new A6!!! I traded in a 1999 A8 for the new 2005 A6. Wow!!! Even with the smaller engine the car gives me a lot more get up and go than this cowboy could possibly need. Given that I live in a heavy snow area, the added weight of the A6 (compared to the sometime too light old A8) and of course the four wheel drive, made this baby cruise through our snowy streets, especially the hill I must negotiate to get home each night. The creature comforts are outstanding and I actually find excuses to go on journeys now... aided by both the navigation system and sirius radio. In short, I have fallen in love with this  baby and look forward to many years together. Satisfied Owner But Waiting to See When I lease this car, with 400 miles on the odometer, there was a vibration in the steering wheel and on the floor of the car. After returning it twice, and wheel balancing and an exchange of driveshaft from another car and new wheels, it took the dealership at least three weeks to find out the nature of the probem and hopefully correct it. Not what you would expect with a new car of such \"high quality.\" The air conditioning system gadgets are too complicated to use.Too many Elvis Presly selections in the Sirus, no Blues as I recall. This car beats E-Class and 525,530(BMW) Interior is best of any car in this class I\\'ve seen. Beautiful and classy use of real wood, leather and aluminum. Love the Quattro All-Wheel Drive in dry or wet conditions. Pickup speed could be a little better (I think it\\'s rated at 6.8 seconds 0-60). Dual exaust gives a nice sound under heavy acceleration. 10 way seats are very comfortable. Push button start/stop option is a great convenience. Love the styling... especially the bold new grille on front. It separates it from any other brand on the road. LED\\'s are used on tail section for turn signals and rear lights. The paint finish is the best I\\'ve seen on a car at ANY price level. A6 3.2 is Very Impressive  This car has been a joy to drive. Have the black with amaretto interior. The power may not be class leading but it is more than enough. Cabin is very quiet and engine is nice a throaty. Drives like a true luxury german sedan. MMI is not that difficult to use, you get used to it really quick. Sweeeet!! I just replaced my Lincoln LSE with my first German car and what a difference!  The quality of this car is fantastic and it drives nice.  Great value. A6 4.2 I strongly recomend the Audi A6 4.2, which is  about  equal to the A8. I have owned the BMW 745IL and Mercedes S class. The build quality of the A6 is equal to the BMW and better than the Mercedes.The car has  more horsepower, a ride that is slightly inferior in the comfort area, but  more athletic than the others. It is $25,000.00 less in price, thus the value is much greater. For those who want a very nice luxury car but do not require the more upscale badging of the other two fine vehicles, this car is best.  I  had the Lexus LS 400 and 430 also. Both  were junk. Within 15,000 miles both cars needed new tires, a replacement motor for the steering wheel and more. Rearend slides in rain. Born to Drive Two months into my first A6 (traded in a BMW 5) and I am very pleased.  The quattro system makes cornering better than ever and oh so secure.  Interior and accessories are top drawer.  MMI has extensive capabilities and the Bluetooth link makes hands-free cellphoning automatic.  Ride is Goldilocks-not too firm, not too soft.  Long distance comfort (FL to MO in 16 hours) is a pleasure.  Would advise all who can\\'t cotton to new BMW 5 to look at the A6-it\\'s made me happy. Hands Down... This is Audi\\'s Best Yet! This is my third Audi dating back to \\'98 and now the all new \\'05 A-6. I\\'ve never been let down but honestly always lifted up with how much Audi seems to fine tune the already finely tuned vehicle. This new A-6 is truly a masterpiece. I test drove the 530 and 300 series \\'cedes and there\\'s just no comparison.The Beemer may have had a slight advantage with steering at slower speeds but that was absolutely where it stops for comparisons sake. You just can\\'t match the quattro with anything. Audi is lightyears ahead of any all-wheel competition and the comfort and solidness you feel is really unlike any driving experience. The MMI is such a breeze and so functional too. Way to go Audi. Very Nice  A6 fun to drive if it starts  My Audi is less than 6 months old, it has 4200 miles on it. Twice in three weeks it refused to start using the \"Smart Key\" Feature. I tried to use the traditional key instead. Not only did that not work as well, but the car refused to let me retrieve the key. The Audi also froze in Park, and the power would not go off. By the time it was towed to the service center, the battery was dead. It was in the shop for 6 days the first time, it\\'s been in for 7 days now for the second time. The service center still can not find out what\\'s wrong with it. They did give me a nice loaner, however. Awesome Car This is my third A6.  My first two had the 2.7, V6 engine.  All the things I did not like about the previous A6\\'s appear to be corrected, ie. Navigation display, front seat storage, sun glasses compartment, cell phone charge outlet, acceleration delay, body roll on cornering, electronic instrument panel.  The only item not fully corrected is the cup holders, however, with the power and fun this car gives you, you should not be worrying about cup holders.  Audi has out done themselves on this vehicle.  I had great success with my previous A6\\'s.  After 3000 miles I can say that \"I LOVE MY CAR!\"   Best LSP For comfort and drivability this is this best luxury sports sedan.  Pure Joy It is simply a joy to drive, do not take my word, just run to the Audi dealer and you be the judge. I love it. Great redesign I knew I\\'d replace my \\'02 A6 4.2 with an \\'05 when I saw the October \\'04 announcement of the \"new\" A6.  The exterior look is only surpassed by the interior comfort & toys. The extra power, 335HP, was unnecessary, but welcome.  I step on the gas pedal and smile.  Since buying my first A6, driving in the Northeast is fun in any weather. Ouch This vehicle is a technical marvel. The only thing I am disapointed with is the harsh ride on roads with expansion joints. You can feel and hear the car hitting each one very hard. An adjustable suspension like the S class would make this A6 near perfect. Surprised I\\'ve considered an Audi in the past but the introduction of the 335 hp V8 sold me. The car is very civil yet quick and responsive. The premium sound system is great Hot Black Audi A6 4.2 This car is awesome.  Its got great get up and go, all the extras are nice.  The Voice Recognition system takes a little getting use to, and for some reason does not understand women well. The Bluetooth phone system in is great - make sure you have a phone compatible with the system.  My Motorola V600 works real well with it - its great!  Pulls up all the numbers on your SIM card, recently dialed numbers, missed calls too.  The Tiptronic transmission is a lot of fun to use as a 6 speed.  If you can get into this car do it!  Finally Satisfied I have had my A6 4.2 for about 3 weeks now and I must say that I thoroughly enjoy this car. I was looking for a stylish interior. I moved from a BMW 540i 6-speed manual to the Audi. I thought it was going to be a step down from the BMW 545i that I was looking at. The interior in the Audi is really laid out nice. Their information system is a lot easier to use than BMW. The MBZ E500 was $11,000 more money without the Nav, XM Sat Radio, etc...Not quite the head turner as my BMW, but worth every penny. Consider me extremely satisifed. Best Performing Car Only flying feels better First Audi This is my first Audi - other car a \\'01 BMW 530.  Traded in \\'04 Lexus GS300 for the Audi.  This is certainly more powerful and agile than the Lexus but I still think the BMW handles way better all around although the Audi is Great in the snow and love the interior.  It seems to need a bit of a \\'warm up\\' on first start - a bit hesitant and it is garaged.  Once it\\'s going, it\\'s seems OK.    Never buy an Audi I have had my Audi for a little over two months now and have had nothing but problems. My interior has peeled, various buttons have gone out including my electronic seating, my transmission has been replaced and I have had several leaks (oil and windshield wiper fluid each twice).    I have done my research on these cars and will never be an owner of an Audi again. I have since traded my car in for a Lexus, which was worth it.  Super great interior and comfort Careful consideration is paid to making every control very accessible, logical and easy to use. Not one idea was left without especial attention paid to it. That makes it much more fun to enjoy the many ammenities in can come with. It will pamper you and get you spoiled in no time !! It will take you back to wanting to stay in your car while it is parked, just to onjoy the ambiance and all of what it can offer you !! Comfortable in Carolina The 4.2 is truly a magnificent car. It took four months to get it after I ordered it, but it was worth the wait.  The navigation system is one of the easiest to use that I\\'ve seen, and the voice recognition is just fun!  The handling and solid feel is unmatched.  The controls are easy to access and for the most part easy to learn, and I still have a lot to learn.  There is so much the car can do.  The ambience lighting really gives the interior a warm feeling, and to control the intensity of the lighting is even better.  I know I will enjoy this car for years to come. One Drive and You\\'ll Fall in Love I\\'m not an automotive enthusiast.  When the opportunity arose to upgrade to a mid-level luxury car I decided to test drive all the major brands.  I tried a Lexus GS430, Mercedes E500, BMW, Acura and then I found an Audi dealership.  I took a \"loan\" of the A6 4.2 (they just give you the keys to borrow and tell you to come back when you\\'re done) and I knew immediately I had to have that car.  The power under the hood and the handling was simply awesome.  It was more comfortable than anything else and features for the money beat all the competition.  When I brought it back I tried the 3.2 but it was too late I was already spoiled.  I\\'ve been thrilled with my A6 4.2 ever since. Nice ride! Very Impressed After spending 20+ years driving cars made in Japan, I took a chance this time on the new A6, and what a pleasant surprise!  This car is exactly waht I was looking for...the comfort and bells & whictles of a Japanese car, with the performance of the German made cars.  It\\'s the perfect balance!  It doesn\\'t drive as hard as BMWs or Mercedes, its just right! A Great Car! My 2005 Audi A6 3.2 is fantastic! It has exceeded my very high expectations. It is a blast to drive and even more fun in sports mode. The new lines are great and the interior is extremely comfortable. Love my A6 - If you\\'re going to buy one, go all in I\\'ve had guys who work at the dealership I bought my 2018 A6 remark that it\\'s the nicest A6 they\\'ve seen. I bought the Prestige trim  - 3.0T, driver assistance package, comfort seating package, and cold weather package - with florett silver metallic exterior and atlas beige (valcona) interior. I previously owned japanese cars  - toyota or honda - that were progressively higher end trim as I got older and had more disposable income, but they were never luxury cars. I personally subscribe to the belief that if you\\'re going to buy a luxury car, wait until you truly can afford it then get the higher end, where you notice and can enjoy the engine performance, higher end tech, interior quality etc. I still love driving my A6 almost a year into owning it. In this case with the 3.0T Prestige plus options, it was close to $70k, no doubt a high cost, but again, I waited quite some time and took care of other financial priorities first.  In owning the A6 Prestige 3.0T plus options, I notice the drastic difference between my beautiful, powerful A6 and the less powerful, pedestrian quality materials on lesser A6 versions when I use a dealer loaner. BTW, there is an important warranty option - 10 years, 120,000 miles. At this cost, meaning the high relative cost of a fully decked out A6, compared with a few thousand more for this extensive warranty, I am surprised some choose not to buy this. It seemed like a no brainer to me. My 2018 A6 comapred to 2016 A6 The 2018 drives better.  The ride and steering seems more connected.  The car moves off from a stop quicker.  Same suspension and 18\" tires. The Apple Car Play and LED lights are an improvement.  I now have driver assistance package  with auto following cruise control, lane departure warning  and auto collision avoidance.  I am very pleased as I expected more of the same.  S-line trim looks better too. Creamy ride 2.0 turbo with 19” 10 spoke wheels.  Bought just a few weeks ago.  I’ve had an Audi in the past and just had to come back.  Something about the way an Audi drives just works for me.  So far very happy with the ride.  Seats comfortable, teenagers are happy in back, wife loves the look of the car.  I drive the 3.0t, and it is a much more refined delivery of power than the 2.0t.  But I kept another 7k in my pocket with the plenty capable 2.0t.  Regarding engine note: no question a 4 banger is under the hood, but honestly it’s still a joy the drive.  Quick around town and a bullet on the highway. Corners great - mileage is a little under what’s on the sticker for city driving and accurate for highway.  I’m getting 18/30 rather than 22/31.  But I’m still having fun with the right peddle:). Hard to keep it under 90mph on the highway - just so smooth and quiet. I like my music, and the upgraded Bose sound system delivers - no complaints.  Pandora, Apple play all works well. Overall just a cool car, very happy with my choice.  Finally Found My Car! I\\'ve owned and leased several different makes of cars & SUVs. The Audi A6 has been the best by far! I moved from a Q3 to the A6 for it\\'s cargo space. It\\'s very responsive, has great gas mileage, and handles wonderfully in the rain, ice & snow. The back support makes for a comfortable long drive. The only very small inconvenience I\\'ve noticed is that the front arm rest is too close to the cup holder, making larger cups impossible to fit. I would also recommend Alex at Audi Kirkwood as a sales brand specialist. He was honest, professional, EXTREMELY knowledgeable & patient during the entire process. A6 a fun car to drive The A6 is a dream to drive. Very responsive...outstanding passing gear. The CAFE stop and go can be harsh/abrupt at times. Sound system more than adequate. Safety features are position well. Could use a technology update (ie. individual tire pressure readings, navigation map-mileage distance when using this feature). I’m very happy with my A6! The only item that I think needs to be reworked is the console which is very limited space to put items in. The armrest is fine, but there needs to be room under that and it’s very limited. A-6 is A OK with me Warning... once you have one Audi, nothing else measures up. Mine is the 2024 prestige A-6 diesel. Yes I had to have the fix for diesel, but the company treated me great. I get about 40 on the highway and 27 in town. This is my 2nd A-6... the other was gas. So fun to drive. Every wants me to drive. I love the comfort. Its funny, when I run into other Audi drivers, we all seem to smile and feel we discovered a great secret. I will never have anything but an Audi! The best of the luxury sedans in this segment I looked at a lot of options, including the new redesigned E Class.  This had all the options I wanted, comfortable ride, but sporty feel.  Great daily driver, great road trip car.  Whisper quiet inside.  Only feature I would like is remote start, but alas, Audi doesn\\'t support that in any of its lineup.  Was a reasonable tradeoff for all the other features and benefits of this car.  Outstanding! Disappointed Several problems occurred upon delivery, like need to replace warped brake rotors, repair vacuum leak, and splitting paint and rust along welded seam on roof.  Also, problem with radio turning on by itself several times each time car is started - dealer cannot fix.  Seats not very comfortable on long drives, despite being very adjustable. Brake feel is mushy and uncertain.  I traded a 2008 A6 for this car, and although the ride and safety features have improved, I prefer the old one. Jose I love my Audi A6 Not the newest German mid size but still great Looked at the 2016 BMW 5 series and the latest Mercedes E class (4 cylinder model). Ruled out the new 5 series for fear of 1st model year run reliability woes and the 6 cylinder E class is just too expensive.   Just loved the ride and handling of the A6, it\\'s the right combination of sport and luxury. Plus this is the only German midsize you can order with REAR side airbags  and of course outstanding crash testing. The ride and handling are outstanding. Some formal car magazine reviews had stated the steering is  numb or light but I do not have that impression. The V6  gives you power whenever you want. I purchased a factory order Premium Plus with 19\" sport package and the layered walnut. The 19\" wheels ride well without added harshness and the 10 spoke wheels look stunning when paired with Florett Silver body color. The  black headliner with black leather and layered walnut wood option make the cabin exceptionally rich.  The MMI interface doesn\\'t take that long to figure out. Voice commands are a little slow but the map with google earth view is pretty cool. The instrument cluster driver display can be customized to show different driver info and is nearly the equal of the newer cars that have the all digital display for the driver instrument panel. The Bose stereo is  good but not great (and wasn\\'t going to cough up $4200 for the Bang and Olufsen upgrade). Driver\\'s assistance package work very well especially the adaptive cruise control keeping distance from the car ahead of you and lane assist keeping you in the lane. Yes it\\'s the oldest of the German luxury mid sized sedans in terms of this version, but it stacks up well to the competition. I love it and have NO regrets buying it. Comfortable, Quiet, Easy Handling, Fuel Efficient There is no perfect car, but this one comes pretty close, with mostly \"pluses\" and just a few \"cons.\" The only options I did not order on the Prestige Package were a Bang and Olufsen stereo, the $3300 comfort seat upgrade and night vision (The Prestige comes with 12-way ventilated seats). I also stuck with the stock 18\" 245/45 all weather tires because of their higher profile. On the plus side are its stylish look in Florett Silver with Atlas Beige/Dark Walnut interior, great handling, extreme comfort, great temperature and direction controls, wonderful visibility, well-designed driver assistance, and great parking assist (easiest car I have ever parked beside the 2017 Q5). The virtual cockpit and heads up displays are easy to use, informative and very helpful. It\\'s great having the Nav display directly in front of the driver. The transmission shifts smoothly, and for such a powerful car, it is surprisingly quiet  when accelerating, and there is virtually no wind noise when cruising, The ECO start/stop was a little hard to get used to (abrupt stop), but I really like the fuel savings it affords around town. Speaking of fuel economy, I have been getting between 30-36 mpg on trips and averaging 25 mpg combined. FANTASTIC! I think the secret is that I allow the adaptive cruise to pretty much control the car on a trip. On the \"con\" side, the info system does take time to figure out. I spent over 2 hours with Audi Connect getting the AT&T SD card and navigation system reprogrammed, I am still learning the system. I wish all the information on the retractable Nav screen could be turned off so the entire screen displayed the route. I wish connection to the internet was included in the price like GM proposes to do on its new models. The garage door HomeLink was a bear to set. The salesman spent over an hour at my home setting it up, but it has worked well since being programmed. Dash glare is another \"con.\" I had ordered the brown interior and dash trim with the expectation that dash glare would be reduced. NOT! My 2011 Volvo S80 had a similar colored dash that gave off almost no dash glare. Instead of using a grained glare-reducing material over the entire dash, Audi used hard plastic around the heads up display and other selected places which, in combination, produces a lot of reflection on the windshield. It apparently failed to engineer the windshield angle to reduce glare on the type of dash materials it chose to use. I also join others in expressing a desire that the car have a little more storage space in the front passenger compartment, but I have learned to do more with less junk in the cabin of the car. It is only these later \"cons\" that kept me from giving the car 5 stars overall. Its looks, its performance, its comfort, fuel economy, etc. all call for 5 stars. Because of some convenience issues, however, I could only give it 4 overall. (PS: The price for this category of car was in line with its competitors, and I thought the dealer treated me fairly considering the additional warranties that were included in the out-the-door price. Therefore, the price rating should be read as an N/A. It was not a factor in my ratings.) Most awesome car I have ever owned This car is the best car I have ever owned. Great everything. One tiny tiny irksome feature - the stop-start feature is enabled when you start the car and you have to turn it off every time. I do not care for it because sometimes it is a hard stop/stop jerk. 2017 A6 I have only had this car for a month but am still in love with it.  The interior cabin is loaded and rides extremely smooth.  The initial acceleration is a little sputtery but I believe it is due the emission auto off feature that comes standard.  MMI system is easy and simple to use and I love the heads up display options and how easily you can change them. Best Car I Have  Purchased Great car but avoid the 20 inch summer tires if you want a comfort ride. The 20 inch handle much better when the car is pushed in the curves. But for everyday, the smaller tires are better overall. This is my third Audi and I am sold. Love the Audi A6  rear end review. rear view camera (360) is soft low pixels with no adjustments. Stretched to fit a wider screen without the needed DPI. Cant make out a rear wall in low light.  Very disappointed for a luxury auto to chintz on such a important safety feature. It was my second choice. I considered and drove the usual suspects in this class. While the A6 rise to my top spot among the German imports, I found the design and features to be a bit dated. Probably about two years behind the Swedish and other imports. Learned my lesson I was thrilled after a couple of good years to be able to buy my 2000 A6 Avant in CASH in the spring of 2000. The car looked good, handled like a dream, acceleration was OK, and it had a 3 year bumper to bumper warranty. I forked over the $39K and proudly drove my car home. After a week, the dash light up with the check engine light. This was a light that I would become far more acquainted with over the 9 years that I owned the car. The first incident was an O2 sensor. \"No problem\" I thought, as the dealership assured me that they had a loaner car. Well the loaner turned out to be the mechanic\\'s eight-year-old personal project car - with no radio. There was a gaping hole filled with wires where the radio should have been, but it got me to work for two days while my car was in the shop.  Over the 9 years that I owned this thing, six years without warranty, it cost me over $16K in REPAIRS (and I\\'m not counting oil changes and tires in this figure). That check engine light would come on, and the car would eat another $2-4K in repairs. I had the propellor (drive) shaft replaced twice, the airbag control computer once, brake jobs cost over $1000... it was ridiculous. And ALL of the work had to be done by an authorized Audi dealer. The dealer that I brought the car to also would fix one thing, and break something else. \"It was like that when you came in\" they would claim. Letters to Audi went unanswered and I got fed up with the whole \"Audi Experience.\" When the car finally clocked 106,000 miles, I sold it in a private sale for $5K and gave the buyer a new set of snow tires, and was happy to see it go. Yes it drove beautifully when it was new, and Quattro is a fantastic all-wheel drive system, but the lack of support from Audi and their crappy dealers made me swear off another Audi. NEVER AGAIN! Good all around package Was looking to buy a Subaru Outback, but when I saw the Audi on a local car lot, I stopped in and gave it a drive. Was impressed by its styling. Very atttractive, but not pretentous. Transmission very smooth, as is engine, which has decent power, and gets good gas mileage for a V-6 AWD, about 25 MPG on highway. Fantastic on slick/wet roads. Nice leather interior that doesn\\'t have any rips or discoloration after 130,000 miles. If you fold the rear seat down, there is a ton of room in the back. Great on long trips. Very reliable except for front driving light bulbs don\\'t last very long. Well built, doesn\\'t have any rattles  Like a bleached blonde Flashy and fast. Your friends will envy you. But very expensive to maintain. Great fun to drive. Great performance/handling, great in snow. Comfortable, refined, roomy. Now the bad: poor gas mileage (17 mpg); eats brakes-pads & rotors every 18 month$, control arms bearings replaced twice in 3 years, water pump. Interior trim always falling off. Undercarriage airdam fell off while driving. LED display goes to black. \"check engine\" light goes on frequently, dealer says \"intermittent\"-no help. Don\\'t buy one without extended warranty!  I bought this used with about 27k on it. Warranty expires at 100k, then I\\'m done with it. Scratched the Audi itch.   Enjoy it, but.... We bought our Wagon 4 1/2 years ago and we\\'ve really enjoyed the styling and room it provides.  As mentioned previously, the engine could have had more power but the T\\'tronic gives you the ability to get creative on the road.  Great for hauling and it still looks great but the cost of minor problems is a bit much.  we have 81k and i\\'m debating selling or trading in just because i worry about what\\'s to come.  again, i love the german styling, but my japanese vehicle is 3 years older and i feel safer on long trips in it rather than the audi. A6 Wagon Very useful car, holds a ton of stuff, \\respecially if you add a roof rack. A \\rbit underpowered at 200 HP, but \\radequate if you don\\'t do a lot of hill \\rdriving. Great for kids, safe and \\rreliable. Interior is superb for a car \\rof this price. Great car This car is great.  I am happy with it Great Car I\\'ve owned several cars from SAABs to \\rHondas to Acuras and by far, the \\rengineering in the Audi is far superior \\rto all the cars I\\'ve owned.  There is \\rno shortage of safety features in this \\rcar and they\\'ve thought of most \\rconvenience features in this package. Best of All Worlds We already have two other Audis, and \\rbought a used 2000 A6 Avant (coming off \\rlease) this past summer.  Great car.  \\rLike all recent Audis, the best fit & \\rfinish, interior and exterior design in \\rthe business.  This is by far the best \\rlooking wagon in North America (my \\rsister owns a Merc E class wagon, and \\radmits my car\\'s superior style / \\rdesign).  This car is very comfortable \\ron long hauls, and has great space for \\rmy three dogs.  Superbly crafted, with \\rlots of nice touches (double cargo \\rmats, sun shade, retractable cargo net, \\retc.).  Totally different in ride \\rcharacter from my 2001 A4 2.8Q (both do \\rwhat they do quite well!). Od to Audi Quattro in New England, what can I \\rsay.  A descreet car with an interior \\rnothing short of exception.  Nothing \\rclose this side of a Rolls, trust me \\ron this.  Build quality is the best of \\rthe German Big Three (Merc, BMW and \\rAudi).\\r I\\'ve owned jsut about everything but \\rAudi in general always has me smiling. Fun car, NOT RELIABLE I loved this car, I had a 2.7 bi turbo that i bought from a friend with a rack and pinion leak. well I wish that was the only problem. Unfortunately the dual mass fly wheel went out at 140k and so did the Abs module. the dealer ship gave me a $6500 estimate to repair a car that was worth of $2500. So i sold the car for dirt cheap. over all it was awesome on the highway, but i signed at launch. I got gaped pretty bad by a 2017 v6 Camaro but once i reached 60 I flow by him. It\\'s a fun daily driver but only if you have a ton of money to keep up with maintenance. Oldie but goodie Excellent mileage, awesome comfort and I am so happy with the cost when I purchased it and overall excellent vehicle for all ages. As far as cost to repair well let\\'s just say it\\'s European. I am absolutely satisfied with my used 2000 Audi A6 Quattro  2000 Audi A6 quattro 2.7t  My green alligator Like many others have said, expensive car to buy, will go anywhere in the snow, lots of power with the twin turbos, but after about 60,000 miles lots of leaks and sensor problems.  Spent about equal time driving and being in the service station.   Vacuum leaks,  cam shaft seal leaks, valve cover leaks, axle leaks.  Just about every week, something new comes up to fix and the repair bills were about $4,000 per year.  Figured I better get rid of it before the turbos, engine, or transmission need replacing because those thing would cost me more than the car was valued at.  I did keep the car for about 16 years, but if I had to do it over again I wouldn\\'t by an Audi (way overpriced), or if I did, I would sell it at about 60,000 miles.  They do not hold their value well.On a positive note, one of the best things about the Audi was after 16 years, there was no rust anywhere on the vehicle.  Audi did an excellent job with metal finishing and plastic protecting guards underneath the vehicle to limit corrosion on these New England salted roads.    In closing, my personal experience with the A6  is that it just keeps eating away at my wallet, my green alligator.   Never another Audi for me. What Should I Do? 99,000 miles, no hard driving or accident, decently maintained.  Here are quote for repairing items from local dealer \"Biener Audi\" today.  $580.-  Front break pads and rotors $560.-  Rear break pads and rotors $165.  Coolant tank reservoir $800. Radiator $1100. Exhaust complete $1100. Both front lower control/wishbone suspension arms $192.- An hour & a half diagnosis $1600. Timing belt w/all rollers & water pump thermostat $400. Mirror (rusted because water sipping in) $800.- LED dashboard Total: $7,297.   What should I do?          Never again While this car was fun to drive it gave me nothing but grief after 95k miles. I had to replace both cv joints, the torque converter at 110k, the turbo after 100k, the front dash display, and a multitude of gaskets/o- rings-seals. Overall the car cost me $10,581.84 in repairs in two years! Audi\\'s are great cars when you buy them new and trade them in after 5 years, otherwise buyer beware. This is a great car!! I have had the car for 7 1/2 years.  It still looks and drives great.  I just looked around, since I figured it was time to replace the car, and there is nothing that I like enough to justify replacing this car.  I upgraded the suspension, and chippe dit 7 years ago, and it is still just a great package. Well Worth it! Being a lead foot driver for over 9 years I have no complaints about this car. After so many miles my last car (Acura) felt half as powerful, run down and rusting everywhere. This car feels as powerful and smooth as day 1, no rust (12 yrs rust warranty), the interior still feels modern and cool and I get compliments all the time about how new the car looks. The car seats 5 comfortably pus it has a lot of cargo space. I change tires yearly (summer/winter) and always manage to fit my 245mm wide tires and rims in the trunk with lowered back seats with plenty of room to spare. I love this car and would only trade it for another Audi. Great car but... My Audi is a great car, but... don\\'t get me wrong, this car shows power when needed and is able to handle almost anything. I am 18 and I drive hard. The best thing about this car is its turbo. Nothing is better than hitting the turbo redlining the engine and passing all of those slow drivers on the highway. The car also handles very well. Taking sharp turns at 30-40 mph gives you such a rush. However, because it performs so well it is easy to forget the car\\'s limits. Don\\'t buy a 2000 A6Q Beautiful to look at. Metallic tan w/ a tan inside brown dash. I still have my 1996 A6 w/ 250,000 miles on it as we speak I have to drive the 96 because the 2000 is in the shop.  Since owning the car I\\'ve replaced both cat converters w/ O2 sensors, timing belt water pump , all ball joints and tie rods, a number of blown cooling hoses (leaving me stranded) including 1 that was inside the engine $$$$. Spent over $2,000 on a oil leak (still leaks) was told that it\\'s natural for that to happen, sensors etc.  My 96 was sooo flawless and fun to drive much more powerful and comfortable. THE ABSOLUTE BEST CAR I\\'VE EVER OWNED!!!. I COULDN\\'T WAIT TO GET A NEWER ONE AND NOW I\\'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER AUDI  Love to Drive my A6 Purchased my A6 at 46K and it now has 112K miles. Everyone time I get in to drive it feels like a brand new car. The worse the weather the better it feels to drive. I truly love this car. Had only one big problem when interior flooded when cowl drain plugged. Great mileage as it averages 22 mpg when driven daily with AWD. Very well engineered. multiple oil leaks Don\\'t get me wrong I love driving my Audi A6 2.7.  But don\\'t let me park in your driveway. I have the valve cover gasket changed three times last year and once this year, it leaks oil out of any and every place possible! The dealer told me that there are over a thousand places that the leaks could come from. I still love driving the A6 and if I could stop those oil leaks, I would  be on top of the world. And why can\\'t someone make better gaskets for that darn Audi. And so what if my check engine is always on, it reminds me that I have an engine for now!!!!!!!   Glad I bought the 4.2l This is my 5th audi.  The 4.2l is a rocket on wheels and my favorite so far.  Engine has been maint. free other then the standard timing belt / water pump change ($800) at 80K. Break pads last ~40K. Minor non-driveability repairs.  Window switch ($110) 2x failed, 5 min DIY repair. Front end torsion squeaks (>$1000). Expensive oil changes ($80). Center display is getting dim. Most fun daily driver I have ever owned.  Unique body and interior of the 4.2l sets it far about the mundane 2.7Ts.  Great in the snow. Almost as fast as my 911.  Find a non-dealer Audi mech., I haven\\'t met a dealer yet that will let me out of the service bay for <$1000 of questionable repairs. Fun to drive but drains your pockets I bought this car with 80,000 a year ago. Its a wonderfull car to drive, i have had majors problems. Trasmission went out with no reverse two months ago.Audi dealer quote was 7000 for a rebulit which was almost as much as the car was worth. If you want a fun sedan 300hp safe in the winter all wheel drive, but it\\'s going to cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars to maintain. I\\'m in the middle right I\\'ve spent already more money than the car is worth. She runs really good now and I hope for the new few years.   I\\'ll buy another one This is the most comfortable - front and back, best performing vehicle I have owned.  4.2 litre is very good on gas -  24 mph at 7 years old. I have put very little money into it -- brakes and preventive maintenance. Cost of ownership has been low.  I will buy another 4.2 A-6 or A-8. I have very little fatigue driving long distances as opposed to my  BMW, Volvo, Toyota. Stay away from this model Problems included: (first two within 3 months of warranty expiration) 1. electronic window malfunction 2. LED dashboard diplay went out 3. Broken plastic in console lid, cup holders, & seat levers 4. Bad CVC joints and suspension assemblies 5. Broken camshaft & blown motor at 84000 miles (no hard driving & well maintained). This car has been big trouble for me The car is now eight years old but has just 57k miles. The last three to four years I have sunk a ton of money into it. Every time I think I\\'m past the worst, something else happens. Most of it has been replacing the water pump, timing belt, etc. But there are things I have not repaired that should be, e.g. the instrument panel and AM radio. The information box is barely readable and requires a whole new instrument panel ($800+). AM radio went out years ago - estimate to repair was $2600! I was about to trade the car in the fall but it needed $1400 in work. Thought I would keep it a while longer, now the tranny goes bad (reverse  clutch) and the estimate is >$7k. I\\'ll never own another Audi. Love the Car but Repairs are Too Costly Overall I am grateful for the exceptional handling, especially fantastic in snow, but the expensive parts and repairs after ~70k miles have me disappointed in the long term value of this car.  Just before the extended warranty ran out, I had the AM radio fixed (it had never worked).  When I picked up the car I found that the warranty company had paid about $1,000 for that repair alone.  Since then I\\'ve been spending about $1.5k - 3k every six months on repairs.  As noted in other reviews, CD player failed and LCD panel faded at about 80k. The cup holders are flawed.  I also no longer run back to the dealer to pay  $110 for diagnosing the Check Engine Light that comes on every 2-3 months.  A6 i bought this car 2 mos ago with 83k.  i loved it at first.  i feel safe in it.  i just had the timing belt go before it should have and cause major engine damage.  i have heard a lot about sensors going bad.  i would never buy another one with out a warranty.  it is just not wise or financially practical because something is bound to go wrong because of the notorious electrical problems, and the cost to fix is high. Wonderful Car I have had my 2.7T since new (6 years) and it is a superb ride. At 70,000 miles I upgraded suspension with Eibach springs, Bilsein gas shocks, 17\" BBS wheels and Pirelli P-Zero Nero tires. Wish I had done that sooner. The handling has gone from floaty to tracking on rails. The turbo motor is smooth, fast and fun. I can take the care anywhere and it looks great, especailly now that it\\'s lowered a bit. Audi is making terrific cars these days. I love it. Only disappointment has been the brakes. Typical Audi issue. Quid Pro Quo Bought the car with 78k miles, to use as a weekly commuter vehicle, between Long Island, NY and New Hampshire, while doing contract work in NY.  I was familiar with a friend\\'s 4.2, and figured a quattro drive was critical for long weekly drives, through a Northeast Winter. However, because I insisted on a standard transmission, but still wanted performance, I went with the 2.7 biturbo 6-speed(sport package). Audi A6 4.2L Attracted by styling and beautiful interior, and of course, typical German handling qualities.   Ride and comfort exceeded expectations.   Some quality glitches but nothing major.   Still as good as new with 65K. Fast but unreliable This is a beautiful car but very expensive to maintain.  Frequently has major mechanical and electrical problems that cost not hundreds but thousands of dollars to fix. Too bad Warranty Ended when it did Let me start off by saying I LOVE the interior design/ comforts. The car has been RELIABLE, but as soon as the warranty expired, the in-dash CD and the HUD info window started failing/ stopped all togther.  Audi is aware of the HUD issues (very common issue), but refuses to address it out of warranty, and is VERY expensive to fix.   Unknown Excellent car. Functional with great reliability. Best of all, it is safe and handles well. 45000 miles in FIVE months! I bought my pearl white A6 in February of this year with 67,000 miles and I should be breaking the 90,000 mile mark before the end of this month (Aug). Aside from two pretty costly repairs: ABS controller and Thermostat replacement;  I\\'m delighted with this vehicle and can\\'t wait to let this Quattro loose in the ice and snow in a few more months.  Thats is what the world-renowned \"Quattro\" AWD  was engineered to do and a superior job it has done, to say the least.  Keep all four turning, everyone! Too much maintenance Bought used at 40,000 miles now has 112,000 miles. Fun to drive. Solid, no squeaks or rattles. Replaced 3 sensors, one of them twice; always $500 a pop. Replaced gasket to stop oil leak and burnt oil smell but hasn\\'t worked. Some front end alignment issues also. No AM radio reception. First foreign car I\\'ve owned, not sure if I\\'ll stay with Audi; more expensive maintenance than my previously owned Ford products.  no more audi\\'s for me! Engine light on/off when wind blows. LCD display fades to back.Changed tire arms twice. Leaks oil. Bottom\\'s out over parking stops/entrance ramps. I\\'m going back to Acura!  Going for Japanese next time I\\'m not impressed, considering how much this car cost and the ratings it has received.  Like way too many other reviews I\\'ve seen, I\\'ve had many problems with the car (and of course they all happened just after the warranty ran out) - at 80,000 miles so far the following has stopped working: the computerized display, the glove box (for no apparent reason according to the dealership), the AM radio, the automatic windows, plus the transmission has started sounding scary (it lurches when changing gears). Mind you, all of these were not at all cheap to repair.  It\\'s a money sink, and I\\'m glad to be selling it. Don\\'t Buy A6 I bought this car brand new in March  of 2000.  It has been driven very little, only has 58,000 miles after 4 + years. It has lots of problems.  The dealer service was passable at best.  Recently though with only 57,000 miles, I was told I need new turbo chargers at a cost of $6,200 dollars.  I was shocked and even more  surpirsed to hear Audi USA they wouldn\\'t cover any of the cost.   I have owned 4 Audi\\'s previously and I will never buy another one.  It\\'s too bad because when it works, its a great car to drive.  Doesn\\'t hold value like a BMW or Mercedes. Good car This is a good balanced car. It doesn\\'t have any major flaws. It is very comfortable, as agile as mid-size can be. It might not look impressive but for day-to-day driving it\\'s just great.The repairs can be costly though. 2000 AUDI Great interior and very good driving car for enthusiast that does not care about rear-wheel drive.  Very good gas mileage 18-20 City.  25 Highway.  Excellent tarction in all weather conditions.  In terms of reliability, it has aways started and has had a few too many trips to the service bay for an odd list of small issues ranging from a broken cup holder to a defective gas tank (recalled twice).  Still looks great and has held up in tough urban driving.  Ride is still very consistent and Quattro is excellent AWD system.  It has never failed me.   Love this CAR I used this site prior to buying my 2.7T. I was hesitant at first but after a test drive I fell in love. This is a wonderful car all around. The performance on wet or dry roads is outstanding. If snow is concern picture this, a hill early morning snow, front and rear wheel cars spinning their tires and an A6 2.7T Quattro going by without a problem. If you are looking for a car that looks good from all angles and performs as goods as it looks. Then look no further than the A6 2.7T. The only complaint is fuel economy. I also recommend Dealer service, they maybe more expensive but they know what they are doing and the peace of mind is worth it. RIDICULOUS ride I\\'ve owned this car for almost a year now, and I drive it every day.  I STILL get excited every time I drive it.  The handling is incredible - I take 35 mph turns at 70 mph with ease.  The 6-spd manual is a MUST- HAVE.  I got this car for the value, options, and just because I love Audis.  It\\'s no exotic car like a Ferrari, but it STILL draws the attention anywhere I drive it. Never Again My 2000 Audi A6 2.7T Sedan was probably a candidate for \\ra \"lemon law\" return.  I have NEVER had \\rso many problems with a vehicle and \\rwhen I finally got rid of it I got \\rclobbered on the resale value.  I\\'m \\rback in a BMW and couldn\\'t be happier!

A sneaky hot rod This car is just plain fun to drive  Still love it after 3 years and 33000 mi This is the best car I\\'ve ever owned, \\rbar none.  Unlike some, I\\'ve had no \\rsignificant problems with the car.  The \\rfew minor ones have been promptly taken \\rcare of by the dealer.  Build quality, \\rattention to detail are superb.  The \\rinterior continues to mesmerize, with \\rthe beautiful red lighting and first-\\rrate materials throughout.  I recently \\rinstalled Audi-approved Eibach Pro \\rSystem (springs and shocks), new tires \\rand 18\" wheels.  The effect on both \\rride and handling was huge.  The car \\rnow looks and feels MUCH sportier \\rwithout sacrificing comfort; it\\'s now \\rthe way it should come from the \\rfactory.  This is my first Audi and I\\'m \\rhooked. A6 2.8 Quattro Sedan While not a rocket, the 5 speed manual\\rallows ample acceleration.A positively \\rfabulous snowmobile, even on unplowed \\rroads.I think the styling, while \\rconservative, is also classic.The \\rinterior is top quality and the seats \\rare truly comfy.Thr ride is Germanic \\rfirm but comfortable. A truly great \\rhighway cruiser. GREAT CAR SUPER HIGHWAY CRUISER AND A DREAM IN  Long Road to Nowhere... After taking a job 82 miles from home, \\rI thought about and drove everything \\rover a month.  I decided on a \\rcertified pre-owned A6 2.7 Sport over \\rthe BMW 5 & 7 and MB E & S class... \\rmore room than the mid size cars, more \\rperformance than the big cars... lower \\rprice.  Price was a consideration \\rbecause at 50k miles a year, I\\'ll be \\rrunning the wheels of this one.  \\rReliability has been good.  At almost \\r100k miles I\\'ve had only 2 minor \\rproblems.  After making it to work one \\rday in 45 minutes on an emergency call \\r(you do the math), my car has also \\rearned a reputation around the \\roffice. Nicest car I\\'ve owned can\\'t beat the quattro, a great ride 2.7T Bought the car for safety (roof airbag) \\rand power. I am definitely not \\rdisappointed. Love the way it takes \\rcurves and hugs the black top and with \\rextra turbo power it moves like a dream!\\rHad minor oil leak, fixed with no \\rproblems. Unreliable Leased this car new in 2000, can\\'t \\rwait to turn it back in.  If we had \\rowned it, it would have been gone long \\rago.  After almost 3 years of \\rcomplaints the dealer finally solved a \\rcold start problem (towed in 5 times) \\rbut after the fix it developed a \\rcooling leak that took 3 visits to \\rcure.  Broken power windows, fuel tank \\rrecalls (2) etc, etc etc. 4.2 Power for any situation Car has been rock solid since date of \\rpurchase. This is my 3rd new Audi. The \\rQuattro system it is unmatched by any \\rother design period.\\rChassis design is flawless for high \\rspeed cruising. Mileage 18/15... Bright \\rspots\\rEngine/Interior \\rdesign/Radio/Seats/Brakes are great... \\rLow points Ride Quality w 17\\x94 \\rwheels/255/40 are rougher.\\r Steering in a little light (however \\rthe Europeans actually comment they \\rlove the steering lighter)?, Driver \\rside mirror could be larger,\\rOverall better than the 540i I \\rreplaced.. Practically in the snow and \\rservice reliability ... Stealth is the \\rword\\x85..\\r Audi A6 2.7T More for your $ For a great combination of performance, \\rhandling (including snow) and luxury, \\rnothing that BMW or Mercedes offers \\rcomes close for the price.  This car \\rhas virtually every luxury (except \\rfor rear window shades and navigation \\rsystem); it retailed for $44.5K & I\\rpurchased it for $42K  Reliability \\rhad been excellent.  After 3 years and \\r36K miles, the car still accelerates, \\rhandles, sounds and smells like new.  \\rThe front powered & heated leather \\rseats and the heated rear seats \\rprovide liveing room comfort for 4 and \\rwill accomodate 5 adults  easily.  Road \\rhandling and dependability were a joy, \\ron dry, wet and snowy New England \\rroads.  Works for me. This car is a blast to drive. Whether \\ryour cruising in town or on the highway \\ryou\\'ll ride in comfort. The drivers \\rseat is by far the most comfortable car \\rseat I\\'ve ever sat in. Haven\\'t had any \\rissues, would recommend this car \\rhighly. If your concerned with the \\rpotential for maintenance costs buy an \\rextended warranty or go buy a Toyota \\rCamry. Best of the Best! Compared to all other vehicles in its \\rclass Audi beats each hands down.  In \\raddition to that the service from the \\rdealer is world class.  Who says you \\rcan\\'t get great cars and great customer \\rservice anymore! The AWD alone puts \\rthis car on top.  Add to that awesome \\rperformance, styling and reliability.  \\rFantastic car! 72000 Miles of Issues Brakes and rotors--twice.\\rAM Reception--nonexistent.\\rRadio replacement--takes 8 weeks.\\rFront Bumper design flaw--tears off when \\ryou go over a parking space stopper.  They \\rpay to fix it the first time.  Apparently the \\rsecond time it happens the design flaw is \\rgone, because you pay.

As \\rwell I went to  NY Car show last year \\rand looked over 5 series BMW ...Audi \\rmay be second but it is a DISTANT \\rsecond at that Just incredible I\\'ve owned this car ~2.5 years now and I Worst I have Owned Since my Dodge Omni I never thought I would make as many \\rtrips to the repair shop as I did with \\rmy 84 Dodge Omni, I was wrong.  My \\r2000 Audi A6 was in the shop about 6 \\rtimes between June and Oct of 2002.  \\rFor a certified Audi this car leaked \\rlike a sieve. One windshield washer \\rleak, 2 tranmission leaks and 2 oil \\rleaks. \\rThe oil and transmission leaks where \\rto solve a buring smell and smoke \\rcoming off the engine; which they did \\rnot!  Replaced a cup holder, CD \\rchanger, battery, and a radio too if I \\rwould wait 6-months for a replacment.  \\rOh, and a power lock switch that had a \\rmind of its own.  Dumped the car for a \\r2003 Honda Accord.\\r Used A6 2.7 BiT Bought this car for my wife (we live in \\ra snowy area, hence the need for a \\rquattro). It was an off-lease vehicle \\rfrom Audi- superclean and well taken \\rcare of. Fun to drive, but not as much \\rfun as a BMW. I love the interior \\rlayout and general fit/finish of this \\rvehicle. Great highway cruiser- \\rstrong, quiet, solid. Suspension a \\rlittle mushy. Terrible gas mileage, as \\rone would expect. Car is tight as a \\rdrum after 2.5 years. Fair amount of \\rturbo lag with acceleration. I\\'m happy \\rto date, and the car still has 6 mon \\rths left of free maintenance!! 2.7T A fine vehicle in all respects, at a \\rgood value considering the contained \\rtechnology. No more American cars After the Audi experience, I would \\rNEVER buy another american car.  This \\rA6 performs better in the snow and ice \\rthan my old 1995 Chevy Blazer 4WD. Just one guy\\'s opinion I have owned Audis since 1990 and this \\rone is the best so far. No question, at \\rthe time I bought it it was one of the \\rbest engineered cars on the road. An unbelievable machine! I beat the heck out of my cars, and my \\rAudi a6 2.7T is no exception.  No car \\rI\\'ve owned has held up nearly as well \\ras this one. I\\'ve racked-up about 70K \\rmiles since April 2000.  No problems, \\rbasides small electrical issues that \\rwere covered under warranty.  Still \\rdrives like new and handles \\rincredibly.  Quattro is awesome in the \\rsnow and responds better than the SUVs \\rI\\'ve owned.  I will definitely buy-out \\rmy lease and keep this one! Audi A6 Great car to drive, some minor \\rreliability issues. Best Car in this Price range I have looked at a few cars before \\rbuying the A6. Here\\x92s how they compare:\\r Acura TL is nice for its class.  It is \\rnot a luxury car. It feels \\rlike an Accord. Compared to the A6, \\rits interior looks and feels cheap. \\rMore road noise. No rear head rest \\r(dangerous in a rear end collision).\\r Lexus GS300 is a bit smoother and a \\rbit quieter but less powerful, loose \\rsteering feel, seats do not fold down, \\rsmaller trunk.\\r BMW 528 has better exterior styling \\rand is more sporty but less powerful, \\rmore road and engine noise, less \\rluxurious interior.\\r Mercedes E320 costs a lot more and I \\rdon\\'t think it is worth the money.\\r BTW, A6 2.8 doesn\\x92t have enough power. Worst car I\\'ve ever owned Constant small problems such as leaks, \\rwindows getting stuck over and over \\ragain.  Rides like a tank.  No pickup,  \\rvery sluggish.  Stereo is 3rd rate.  I \\rthought I was buying a higher end car, \\rthe only thing I got was a headache.  \\rNEVER, NEVER again will I buy an Audi. Rear Air conditioning could be better. The Audi A-6 is the finest car I\\'ve \\rever owned.  I love the all-wheel \\rdrive and wouldn\\'t have another car \\rwithout it.  However, rear seat \\rtemperature control is worthless.  You \\rcan only feel air blowing about three \\rinches away and with all that rear \\rwindow glass, rear seat passangers\\rsweat misurably if its over 90 F. Buy\\rsummer package and more tinted windows Superb vehicle Nothing beats german auto engineering - \\rA6 is very well though through, design \\ris outstanding and performance is \\rsurprising.  4 wheel drive does make a \\rdifference.  I am happy overall. Excellent Price/Performance/Confort The car offers you excellent pleasure  If you drive it, you will own it. Although I think the BMW 5 series is \\rthe cherry on top, the A6 is the cream \\rwith the cherry stain on it.  This is \\ran awesome car.  Comfort, looks, all \\rwheel drive, you will have to get the 5 \\rto beat it. A Great Machine First Audi I have owned. Excellent performing vehicle. Very comfortable to \\rdrive with plenty under the hood when needed - or just wanted. Lots of trunk \\rroom for the golf clubs, skis, and whatever else. No reliability difficulty at all \\r2 years into owning it. Unreliable We have gone through 3 sets of brakes \\rin under 38,000 miles.  Also, we have \\rhad the front tie rods replaced, the \\rtemp. gauge needed repair, the check \\rengine light goes on and off at least 3 \\rtimes between services and the car is \\rburning a lot of oil - once the low \\rpressure light came on.  The garage \\rdoesn\\'t seem to think any of this is a \\rproblem.  I\\'m frustrated. 2015 Audi A6 Prestige I had this car since  July 14, 2014 and 72,000 miles.  I have truly enjoyed the car. It is fun to drive and it has held up well. The 3.0 Super Charged engine provides good power.  The ride is what is expected from a premium car. The external and internal appearance is very appealing. The concerns are with the automatic transmission noticeable shift points which is especially noticeable from a start at a stop light.  The brakes are adequate but could have a better feel and modulation.  Steering is good for most drivers unless you are a car critic. Recently, I had to replace both front wheel bearings, the driver side in January and passages side in May. I am happy with my car and plan on keeping it for two to three more years. 2015 A6 Prestige3 I\\'ve owned 2 A8 and let me say the A6 does a great job.  The car is every word of elegant.  Quiet the v6 awesome better than the v8 I\\'ve driven. Average mpg 21.8 around town.  Only issue audi connect couldn\\'t really get it to work right. Second Audi Love Audi, my first one, a great car was a 5000 and it\\'s taken me 20 years to buy another one before I was impressed. I drove a1985 Porsche 911until now, this car reminds me of it, as far as the way it handles (of course it\\'s not a Porsche). I research cars thoroughly before I buy and keep my cars on average of 10 years so I have to have confidence it\\'ll last, perform and not stay in the repair shop. I think this will fulfill my expections. Little annoyances that add up Let me preface this by saying I\\'ve owned 4 BMW 5 Series in a row, the last of which was a 550i (circa 2012+/-).  I decided to open my mind and consider getting something different, for a change.  After reading the reviews, it appeared the A6 had surpassed all its competition, including the 5 series.  You know how test drives go... I didn\\'t really get to push it and certainly couldn\\'t appreciate what daily and practical use of the vehicle would entail.  You\\'ve read all the professional reviews which tend to ignore some of the annoyances you pick up on after owning the car for a while.  In this review, I will only focus on the negative aspects of this car (not  the positive).  In no particular order... * Bluetooth connectivity was sub-par (compared to our Lexus RX 350).  It takes far too long for  the vehicle to recognize your phone, which poses obvious problems.  If you are using the google maps app on your iPhone and it vocalizes guidance instructions over your car speakers, the  first part of the instructions are always cut off (not so on the much cheaper Lexus).  * iPhone integration is a joke.  In a 2015 model I received the connection to an iPhone 4!  When I asked where my iPhone 5 connector was, the dealership informed me I had to go to Apple to buy the adapter.  Are you kidding me, Audi?  If you connect your iPhone via Bluetooth, you can only select your songs on the Audi display SEQUENTIALLY.  So if you have 3000 songs, you literally have to scroll through each song to get to the one you want.  They give you an Audi app for media, but it was not reliable. Best thing to do is just to hard connect, but you have to turn off Bluetooth  audio, or it will fuss at you. * Navigation has a critical flaw.  Say you enter an address, it may prompt you to select (from about 5-7) a zip code.  If you are unsure, you pick one and if it\\'s the wrong one, you are informed that address doesn\\'t exist.  Why in the world would the option to select a zip code to a non-existent address be available, in the first place? There is also a feature to vocalize (input) the address.  The button to activate this feature never worked reliably.  * Computer processing power is sub-par.  You\\'d think Audi would just step it up a notch and put in a better processor to speed up execution of commands.  It takes forever for your system to initialize.  Say you want to turn on Satellite radio, it may take up to 10 seconds (from when you start the car)... not so on my Lexus. * Seating is not great for road trips.  I was spoiled with my last BMW because I had the comfort seats.  The A6 (2015 version) didn\\'t have this option available (I heard they added it in 2016, but have not verified and don\\'t know just how comfortable it is for long  hauls).  On a few trips to Austin and Dallas (from Houston), I found myself constantly shifting from side to side because the seating was just not comfortable.  My wife (5\\'4\" 112 lbs) had similar complaints.  * Steering still didn\\'t feel as tight as my last BMW550 and, understandably (because the 550 was more powerful) the acceleration was not what I was accustomed to, either.  * Air recycle always turned off by itself.  It will not let you select the option to recycle and stay in this mode.  * No USB to add music to the Jukebox.  You can only do this using a CD, DVD, or memory card. * Transmission/gear issues.  During slow (parking lot) speeds the car would occasionally jerk forward as if a gear was slipping or something. I ignored it at first, but my passenger would always say \"Is there something wrong with your car\".  Long  story short, I had the car for two years (on a three year lease) and put about 10K miles on it.  I sold it and didn\\'t mind paying for negative equity.  This experience, along with my poor experience with Audi Central of Houston, I will likely not purchase another Audi. Excellence isn\\'t cheap, but it\\'s worth it As I filled out the survey and came to the \"value\" section, it was hard to settle on a good answer.  The A6 is an absolutely wonderful car, but it costs a lot too - especially if you opt for the V6 and some upgrades.  In the end, you do get what you pay for, so I settled on four stars, as the car is not a bargain by any means as was my 1999 A4 and 2007 A6 (both Quattro\\'s and V6\\'s).  Had I not owned the aforementioned vehicles, I would never have ponied up $55-60k for this or another upscale sedan.  But eight years with each previous Audi was enough to keep me coming back for more, even if I did vow to never again buy another one if the rate of inflation stays on course as it did between 2007 and this one.  Putting financial matters aside, let\\'s talk about what makes it worth the price for me.   Aside from how solid the car feels inside and out, top to bottom, and aside from the top-notch technological features, I flat-out love the way this car performs in every mode of driving.  I run 50 miles per day on twisty backroads in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and this car makes every mile a pleasant one.  Whether I am in the mood for some spirited driving or just relaxed cruising, the smoothness and grace with which this automobile takes these roads is little short of astonishing.   It is silly-quick, handles like a sports car, and in true Audi form does it smoothly as silk.   I do not advise anyone pay for the \"sport package\", as this one handles as well or better than did the 2007 A6 WITH a sport pkg.  Bottom line:  Even tho the car is quite attractive and had luxury appointments and technology aplenty, it still manages to give the driver a superb driving experience, which to me is priority #1.  My only complaint is that the German carmakers who had always prided themselves on providing drivers with the best road-feel on planet earth have all gone with the electronic steering which takes so much of that feel away from the driver.  I guess we have to chalk that one up to \"progress\".  Interior appointments, as all have stated, are excellent, and the superb paint and bodywork will probably outlast all the mechanical components.  If there was one nicety I would put in the must-have list, it would be the Bose stereo system.  An automobile this good does not deserve to have lousy audio.  If you want a sedan that pampers you while also understanding you actively appreciate an excellent driving experience, look no further.  It may not be cheap, but you absolutely do get what you pay for. Style class and comfort best car i own till date.. Great Choice - Go with the 2.0 This was my first Audi and so far, for the most part, it\\'s been great.  I opted to go with the 2.0 over the 3.0 and I don\\'t regret that decision in the least.  As the other reviews state, it gives you more than enough power.  It doesn\\'t have the same \"sound\" of the 3.0, but trust me, the zip is there.  Plus, the gas mileage is much better.  The interior has a few quirks, but the materials are top notch.  One thing to note - the breaks squeak in cold weather.  Audi is aware of the problem and has no fix for it.  By cold weather, I mean below 20 degrees.  For a luxury car, I find this rather annoying. I love this thing every time I drive it We\\'ve owned our diesel A6 for three years next month and love it.  It was my daily driver for 2 1/2 years and my 35 minute commute (mostly curvy country back roads) was comfortable and the diesel had plenty of \"umph\" for passing.  It has shift paddles but I never use them as the tranny seems to work fine and I still am not \"in tune\" with the characteristics of the diesel so I let the tranny do the shifting.  I have taken it on three long road trips, each about 600 miles each way, and it is fantastic.  Over 40 mpg at 70 mph with a nice stereo, awesomely comfortable seats, and an efficient cruise control (as an older base car it doesn\\'t have adaptive cruise control).  GPS is great and has voice control that works fine.  We got the prestige with most of the bells and whistles (how did we live without heads up display??)  The diesel-gate hit the fan a few months after we bought it but it never bothered me.  We just had the fix done about a month ago and it seems to drive the same but mpg seems reduced a few percent.  We already received our Audi settlement payment but not the Bosch one yet.   Anyway, six months ago we sold my wife\\'s SUF and bought a truck to pull a trailer so I\\'ve been driving the F150 and she\\'s driving the Audi.  I only drive it occasionally and today was such a day; I\\'m re-impressed with this car every time I drive it.  I can\\'t imagine that aside from size (and this has plenty of rear-seat and trunk room) an A8 can be any better.  Thoughtful touches like the grocery bag hooks in the trunk are great.  The interior (we got the open pore wood with a light tan leather) is still attractive and it is my first car with cooled seats, which are great in the summer (and for my hot-flashing wife!!).  Anyway, can\\'t say enough about it.  Rockville Audi has been great (we had a BMW but the service at the local dealer was horrible).  Last thing; I have managed to find what for me is the most perfect seating position in any car I\\'ve owned.  I have a relatively short body compared to legs/arms but it is fully adjustable and the seat bottom tips back a bit to keep the thighs supported.  Love it!  We normally turn over cars about every three years but have decided to keep this for another three. Overall excellence Purchased car two years old with 19,000 miles. Two years and 26,000 miles later, I have yet to experience any mechanical failing. It drives great, its MMI system is intuitive and easy to use once you spend a bit of time with it, the car handles and drives exceedingly well, especially for long trips. Very comfortable, with only getting in and out a slight challenge for older folks as it sits low. Some have complained that the 2.0 turbo with CVT lags in performance. I\\'ve found it adequate in drive mode with regular gas, giving an excellent 31 MPG on the highway and about 26-27 around town. When rapid acceleration is required, a flick into the Sport mode provides plenty of acceleration. It really is like having two separate engines as it changes the shift points. You\\'ll lose a couple miles per gallon though.In sum, the design, exterior and interior quality, and ride and handling are all very good. The criticism would be the braking, which although decent isn\\'t quite up to the ride and handling of the rest of the car.  I\\'ve changed the oil 3 times at 8-10K miles, and haven\\'t yet been down a full half quart. Audi service, though I\\'ve only needed standard maintenance to this point, though very good is not cheap. When I had to have the 4 plugs changed and the automatic transmission flushed and changed, the price quoted was--are you ready?--over $700! I took it to a good shop and got it done for $400. Hope this helps. Blown Cylinder @ 48K This car seems to eat oil. I bought this vehicle used with 33k miles on it from and audi dealership in peoria az in May of 2016. with in a week of owning it it was in the shop for the o2 sensor. Normal and under warranty so I didn\\'t pay attention. Took it back in on October because i had had to put 2 quarts of oil through. Had an oil consumption study test done. Audi says oil consumption of 1qt every 1.5k miles is normal and not a problem. Fast forward to Apr 2017, CEL came back on, took to dealership and the same o2 sensor was bad again. they couldn\\'t fix it then due to recall filling up their garage. One week later while driving i hit the breaks hard and the car warning lights came on saying that it was out of oil. had to put 1 quart of oil in it right away and took back to dealership. They said it was 1.5 quarts low meaning that my car was 2.5 quarts low without any oil level warnings going off. This car has no dipstick and the oil is electronically monitored. Raised hell about oil consumption and they finally dig a diagnostic. My oil sensor was dead. They replaced it. May 2017 driving to work lost power and the car was stuttering. Took the car to another dealership in scottsdale. 4th cylinder ring failure, only able to hold compression of 35psi, replacing the engine. 48k miles and 2 months out of factory warranty. Audi won\\'t do anything about it...looks bad for them. I bought my wife a q5 from the same dealership after i bought my a6. We traded in her q5 for a lexus nx200t as soon as we started having problems with the a6. So i have a car that bought with 33k miles on it and put 15k highway miles on it commuting in 1 year and the engine is blown and needs to be replaced. Pass on this vehicle. in fact run away. 2-time Audi owner Purchased my 2013 A6 prestige used with 31k miles. It has the B&O system and the 20\" sports pkg; these 2 options being a must for me. I\\'m a previous owner of a 2010 Audi S5. I love the utility of the A6, the 4 doors and folding seats. It\\'s surprisingly quick in acceleration for a 4k lb sedan. Yet, it is also surprisingly agile for it\\'s heft, and it\\'s handling is commendable. It feels planted and sure-footed, and I\\'m definitely a spirited driver. I push my cars whenever I get the chance, driving them to their designed limits! Braking is linear and confidence-inspiring; and the braking prowess of any vehicle is a top priority to me. The looks of the A6 are timeless. The interior is beautiful, with high quality materials. The seats are very comfortable, even for long-term driving. I know, because I\\'m a Chiropractor. The B&O system is wonderful. I\\'m an audiophile and love great sounding music. The one complaint about the B&O system is that it should have a drivers\\' focus option, like the S5. Overall, the best car I\\'ve owned. I plan to keep this car for at least 10 years. I love driving this car every day! A great car for the upper midwest I had looked at the Mercedes E Class, BMW 5 Series and the Lexus GS.I thought the Audi drove and handled better; and although a personal opinion, I liked the exterior and interior styling better than the other cars.I previously had a 2009 Audi A6 3.2 Quatro and I was planning on buying another 6 cylinder car.However, I was very surprised with the power of the 4 cylinder turbo and its lack of NHV, so I bought a car with that engine in Quatro trim.I have not regretted buying the 4 cylinder car and found it to be more than adequate for my typical driving style and commute.Also, when I let friends drive the car, they are surprised it is not a 6 cylinder. Nice Car Could Use Some Tweaks Overall like this car a lot.1st Audi .Have owned 5-7 Audis, 2 Porsches and a E55.The seats are the worst of this group. BMW\\'s best. Needs more support everywhere.The cup holders are way too small and center arm rest interferes.Should switch the cup and freeform spaces front and back of shifter.Engine is great.Plenty of power when requestedPleased with MPG, 20.8 doing mostly suburban driving.Highway is 25-28 mpg.20\" Pirellis have been a bear.Road hazards find these tires.Comfortable to drive, BMW & Porsche much better.MMI is a mess. Too complicated, many submenus, knobs etc.Handling is betters by BMW and Porsche. 2013 A6 Audio System Problems I own a 2013 Audi A6 2.0T. The vehicle was defective from day 1. While I love the car overall, one big watch out is an issues with MMI equipped cars with their standard sound system that intermittently sends a very loud, starting boom noise. The sound will cut out for up to a minute and then play normally until the next time. It can happen infrequently or several times in a day.If you are considering purchasing this vehicle beware of this major, unresolved issue. I have heard that several other models have the same issue. Audi stalled on acknowledging the issue for about 6 months and still does not have a fix. It is believed to be software related.  Very Nice Ride Aviator blue with brown interior.Love the way it handles, gets lots of looks, looks nicer than a BMW 5 series and Benz E class.Very quick off the line and top end.The four rings in my opinion has out done Lexus, BMW and Mercedes. Have had this for a few years now and I am now considering upgrading to an S6. Fantastic Car..........but Only have the car for a week. Overall it is a great car, but, not designed for a \"portly elderly man\" as it is a bit difficult to get in and out particularly if you have bad knees! Once in the car everything is fine.Traded a 2010 Lincoln MKT which developed rattles after only a year or so. It also had \"Unintended Acceleration\"! Yes, it accelerated when I didn\\'t intend it to do so! Dealer would not acknowledge or fix the problem. After more than a dozen incidents, I know it was NOT me! Absolutely Incredible! When the lease was up on my 2010 Acura TL (which coincidentally was my 3rd TL in a row), I decided it was time to explore other options in luxury performance sedans.I test drove some of the usual suspects (BMW 528x and 535x, Cadillac CTS), as well as some lower priced options (Ford Taurus SHO, Chrysler 300C), before ultimately deciding on my 2103 A6 3.0T prestige. I decided to skip Mercedes (too stodgy), and Lexus (too plain) so that made the decision even easier.Every time I sit down in this car it brings a huge smile to my face and its sexy good looks turn heads everywhere I go!If you want a beautiful, fun sedan that you won\\'t see parked beside you at the mall then the A6 is for you! The best value in true luxury sedans We have driven entry level luxury cars for years (Infiniti G, Acura TL, BMW 335).We looked at these again recently when trading in our 335xi coupe - nothing special or exciting.The new BMW was downright expensive with any nice options.We looked at the Audi A4, A5, A6.The A6 has everything - great price, great economy, great interior, and the dealership was much better than our Seinfeldesque BMW dealer. We had to get the A6 and have not regretted it. 2013 A6 2.0T Quattro I owned a 2006 A4, and just traded in my 2012 Audi Q5 in on my new 2013 Audi A6 2.0T Quattro. I loved my Q5.(I was scared of the decrease of value since the 2013 facelift.)I have had this car a little over a week, and driving it feels safe and exciting. The car handles brilliant. The engine would trick your mind if you didn\\'t know it was a 4cyl. It really feels like a 6 cyl. I was really tossed up between the E350 and this and I am glad I choose the A6. I also love the dynamic & comfort switching feature.  forget BMW, Mercedes, and Jaguar I reviewed and tested the 5 series, e class and the jag but decides that the A6 was the next car for me.The interior, technology and price won me over.I have the car about a month already and am 100% sure i made the right choice.I recomend the A6 to anyone looking at a midsize car in the $50k range.  The best of the best I had a chance to test drive the 2012 Jag XF and the BMW 535 and 550. I opted out of Mercedes finding the styling of the E-class too uninspiring. the A6 which in my mind was perfect. The car is easy to maneuver at low speeds which the steering tightening up at higher speeds. The build quality is impeccable. The styling is more forward thinking than that of MB and Lexus. The LEDs set the car apart as does that Bang and Olufsen sound system. I found the Audi MMI very intuitive and actually fun to operate. The A6 3.0t is a fast engine with a transmission and chassis that makes it feel like the car is hardly working at high speeds. Plain and simple, it puts a smile on my face every day.  Luxuriously sporty!! The A6 is a full size luxury sedan that handles and accelerates like a sports car.  The 3.0 supercharged 300 HP engine has a husky growl that always lets you know that you have plenty of horses under the hood to move out smartly, any time you wish.  Yet the car drives and handles with potent nimbleness and impressive comfort.  The best way to describe the car is CLASS!! Not works looking The car is plagued with door dings and minor scratches.  I found two separate leaks (Oil and coolant).  The dealer stated the car underwent a coolant leak fix but when I asked for the receipt, they could not produce one.  As for the oil leak, they were unaware. Too many problems I love driving this car but sadly have had too many problems.1) had to replace 4 tires after hitting small potholes for flat/sidewall bubbles. Really detracts from driving enjoyment if constantly worrying about the tires.2) total of 4 services for coolant pump, 3 engine related repairs - broken fan, loose lines, and rear view mirror falling off. don\\'t drive if you spend winters driving to ski country Car has some great features but expect problems with front brake rotors.I was hoping Audi would correct brakes and after problems with my 2005 allroad I switched to a Mercedes 300 series. After 52,000 miles I traded in on original brakes. Now my A-6 2010 again has warped rotors after 17,800 miles. Pads only about 40% worn or less. This was same problem in allroad. It just cost me 600 dollars after 15% dealer discount - a true joke. I usually use engine during down hills and am carefull not to heat brakes. I think that it may be slush or cold rain that cold shocks the rotors. When audi covered these under warranty I did not mind, they stopped this in 2005 probably due to frequency - so $$$ 2010 A6 3.0T Premimum Plus This is my 2nd A6, and 3rd Audi. Overall an excellent car. Shopped it against BMW 535xi, but found it to be more responsive, particularly at low speeds, and much more attractive (aesthetically), especially the interior.  Audi did make the car more powerful with the new 3.0T engine, and managed to keep the price down, but it did fall short to some cost savings: The stereo is no longer a Bose unit, hidden cubbyholes under the front seats are gone, the side mirrors no longer fold automatically, and the standard tires are now 97H (even the Q7 gets 109H).  The only reliability issue I experienced was a coolant leak due to a faulty water pump, which was replaced under a recall notice. First Year w/ Audi A6 1st move away from Honda/Acura product in 25 years.  Very impressed with performance, handling and styling of the A6 (supercharged).  Only 2 complaints: very average gas mileage even when not driving hard, in the 18- 20 mpg range.  Have had to visit dealer 5 times for service in 1st year, 1 sch maint, 2 running light burnouts, 1 water pump seal, 1 display malfunction.  Seems like a lot of down time for a new vehicle in this price range. Pure Engineering My New Audi A6 quattro is the best car I have ever driven bar none!  The power of this car thrills me. The Tiptronic transmission is so smooth you can barely feel the shift. It accelerates like a motorcycle. Drive mode and Sport mote are the same.  The interior is huge! I am 6\\'2\" and I can completely stretch my legs all the way out. I can pull the seat forward to allow back seat passengers and I am still driving comfortably.  The Premium Plus and all weather package came with this car. It has the full MMI which has a 10 Gig hard drive for uploading media. the navigation is a little cumbersome at first, but if you use it enough you begin to see just how intuitive it is. I love this car! Traded up from the A4 Traded in an \\'09 A4 for a \\'10 A6 3.0T Prestige with 18\" sport package. The A4 was a great, fun car, but the A6 is better in so many ways larger, smoother and much more powerful engine. Love the understated, classiness of the A6 with its power, handling, and all the techno goodies. Car is quiet, solid and stable cruising serenely @ 70-80mph, and can also be driven fast/hard. Gas mileage so far is pretty good for a car of this size/power - averaging 21-22 with 70-80% highway. Very happy that I traded up!  Car and Driver just did a comparison test and rated the 2010 A6 ahead of the NEW 2011 BMW 535 (3rd) and 2011 Infiniti M37 (2nd). Nice, smooth, sleek Bought my 1st Audi ever, 10,000 miles and going,love it,used to drive a Range Rover sport supercharged before.Audi handling is much better,even in the snow,glue to the ground. Feels safe in the cold, snowy,winter. Checked out the BMW 5series, Acura TL, Volvo, Mercedes Benz E-350 but fell in love with LED lights. Drive it everyday, acceleration wonderful, sound system great,love the MMI. Bluetooth perfect. Audi Convert Was a BMW person for 20 years, tried Infiniti, but always liked the Audi designs, and after making the comparison, decided to lease an Audi A6 Premium Plus (3.0T) from Audi of Alexandria.  Had to drive 500 miles the day after getting the car, and found that the car just gets better and better at highway speeds (much of the trip was through 70 mph zones, and \\x93of course\\x94 I never exceeded the speed limit. lol!).  These cars are made for highway driving, but around town, has great balance of weight, power, handling and ride.  Curb appeal is also very high as these are great looking cars!  It\\x92s one of those cars you can just admire from every angle with both a classic look, but with modern design. Best Audi A6 to date. I leased this car ( Prestige Model) for 39 months in December, 2009. Now have 2500 miles. This is the third Audi A6 I have leased and it is by far the best. The car has had zero defects to date. The feeling of quality and solidness is overwhelming - you literally look forward to driving this car every day. Handling is confident and predictable and cornering is very good.   Wanted this car since 2005 First saw the A6 years ago at an auto show, and I was blown away with the interior, but couldn\\'t afford it.  Now I can, and worth the wait! Solid, luxurious, fast, cool..lots of adjectives to use to describe it but really you just have to drive it.  Drove a 2011 Infinit M37 sport and 2010 BMW 535i sport the same day. The Infiniti disappointed with the driving experience (too soft and slow power delivery), and BMW was way behind in the gadgets (though the handling and power were great).  Audi had all the best features of the competitors and a good price.  The Prestige package and 19in wheels really round out the car.  I heavily researched this purchase, and am satisfied with the decision. First 1,000 miles Purchased after driving BMW 535 and 2011 Infiniti M37. The Audi is the best of both worlds.  I just would give the BMW the edge for handling and the engine, but its interior does not come close to the quality of the Audi.  The Infiniti has upped the ante with their 2011 M37 interior, and I have to say it is better than even Audi\\'s, however the engine and handling where no where near as sorted out as the Germans.  Audi combines the best of each.  I have the 19\" Sport Package, which makes the ride a little stiff, but not uncomfortable.  At freeway speeds the car is in its element.  The 3G MMI is great - although I am still learning its quirks.   Loving it through 1,000 miles! Short review after 1400 miles- A6 I purchased the 2010 Audi A6 3.0 supercharged early this year.  WOW what a car.  I\\'m an Acura guy and looked hard at a RL, the ZDX, and another MDX (would have been my third)  All are great cars with only the MDX considerably less expensive.  They just didn\\'t thrill me.  I was leasing my first company vehicle and I have owned/driven many of the premium brands.  I was always drawn to the Audi, I hardly see one on the road.  The ride is plush, the gadgets are over the top cool, and the 3.0 supercharged engine is top notch.  Its been in the shop once already for check engine (dirt in a sensor) but I don\\'t care.  Every time I drive it I\\'m smiling ear to ear!  Short review after 1400 miles- A6 I purchased the 2010 Audi A6 3.0 supercharged early this year.  WOW what a car.

Every time I drive it I\\'m smiling ear to ear!  too early to regret Just got this a6 on a impulse was looking at the q5 when my wife saw the trunk w/fold down rear seats she was tired of SUV\\'s. Took this for a test drive and the rest is history. We have had Acura 04tl performance wise the tl does not come close  performance enhanced luxury Quite simply a pleasure to drive.  Fit and finish very tight. It begs to be pushed.  The supercharged 3.0T kicks at 2000 rpm and rips to 6500 plus. Snow Monster - Love It I\\'ve had this car 3 months, and love it.  Comfortable, handles great, and fun to drive.  This car is a monster in the snow.  Nothing holds it back in the white stuff.  I test drove all the usual suspects, and picked the winner. first 1000 miles So far, very fun to drive.  Rock solid build quality with responsive supercharged performance.  Fine blend of luxury and speed. So Far so great It was between this & BMW 535. This one came in a little cheaper and was more comfortable in the driver\\'s seat (I\\'m 6\"2). Also more room for kids in back. Drives beautifully - it\\'s a fun car.  Causes silly grin on face while driving Leased the 3.0T with the Prestige package, plus Side Assist and the cold weather package. This car zips, especially between 25-70 mph. I find myself enjoying the light steering touch, great cornering and the handling of the snow and ice with the all wheel drive. 12\" of snow within the first week of picking up the car did not slow it down at all. While various cars and SUVs slip and slide or got stuck on the snow covered streets, the A6 moved as if the pavement was dry. To be critical, there needs to be more storage spaces up front. The trunk was deep, but narrow. To reach items in the back of the trunk, I needed to fold down the rear seats to reach them. Just buy it I looked at all the usual suspects but Audi delivers the best over all score in all areas for a luxury car. I think for the money it\\'s hard to compete with what you get in an Audi. It screams luxury and cool all in one breath. It\\'s the reason anyone in the know right now is buying Audi\\'s over the other brands.  My A6 I have had this car for 3 months and 2100 miles, city and highway driving. It is easy to maneuver, solid in good and bad weather, very comfortable and very stylish. The MMI has become second nature and is really a lot of fun. The car has computer power that exceeds many desktops.  TLC Black Beauty One owner, low mileage driven back & forth to work . No wrecks but a few scratches thanks to parking lots!!! Clean & handsome interior.  Pretty timeless classic car! !! Nice! Traded in my 2007 A4 for a 2007 certified A6 (needed extra room in the back seat). Very happy with the purchase. I do miss the \"nimbleness\" of the A4, but the A6 added a few extras that I didn\\'t have before. There\\'s enough room in the back for a baby seat - behind both driver and passenger and the trunk is enormous! Plenty of power when needed - just watch the fuel gauge. Driving conservatively around town, I get in the low 20\\'s. On the highway - averaging around 70 - I get close to 30 mpg. Pretty good for a big heavy car. Plus, it can run well on regular - unlike the 2.0T A4. Although I do alternate with a tank full of Shell Premium V-Power just to keep the injectors clean. Love it! Bought mine CPO with 30K miles on it.  Have put on 30K in last year.  TERRIFIC car.  The 4.2 is the only way to go.. I think the Edmunds tester slipped or something, my car rips off 5.8-6.0 second blasts to 60 all day long.  But this isn\\'t a stop light dragster. The V8 really comes into play at highway speeds.. going 60 to 90 in a blink.  Interior is elegant and well thought out.  I only have a few, very minor quibbles about ease of use.  Maintenance can be expensive... but then again, it\\'s a German luxury sedan.  My CPO looked practically new when I got it for 1/2 the sticker price.  And the warranty still had bumper to bumper left + 50K miles in CPO.  I\\'ll never buy a new car again. Perfection This is my favorite car yet. I have had other German cars and they don\\'t compare. I have put 10,000 miles on my Audi and not a single problem. The car handles really well in the rain and is perfect for defensive driving with all these other crazy Florida drivers. It is beautiful on the outside and ultimate luxury on the inside. I even left my purse with my cell in the trunk and I was able to still make calls with the built-in bluetooth. I am so satisfied with this car I want to keep it another 3 years and continue with Audi. Love it I had an Audi A6 2.7 2000 which I loved and was very much the sports car. The A6 3.2 2008 is not as sporty but is a great car to drive. The sound system is the best I\\'ve ever owned. The gas mileage is unbelievable with in city averaging over 21 and highway over 30. The car is great car for trips and would highly recommend it to anyone.  My 2007 Audi A6 delivers. The A6 4.2 is my first German luxury sedan, having previously enjoyed both Volvo and Acura sedans. The A6 clearly outclasses, and out-performs, these models, as it should for its premium price. Overall, I am very pleased with this car after 20,000 miles. It has been mechanically sound, is safe and comfortable, has classic euro lux sedan good looks, and delivers great performance. Two things have really impressed me. First, the quattro AWD -- it performs in all weather conditions;I won\\'t have another car without AWD. Second, fuel economy - it is very good for a powerful V8, I often get 26-28 on the highway even when I\\'m pushing the pace. The navigation and MMII systems are lackluster. My Choice over BMW 528ix, Infinity M35x  This is my 2nd certified used Audi A6, the 1st was an Avant that I kept until 185,000 miles and it still drove like new. This 2007 certified used Audi had 27,000 miles when I bought it and I haven\\'t had a single problem. All the power I can use and all I do is think about passing and the next thing I know I\\'m past in absolute silence and total control. The brakes are amazing, but rather touchy and take some getting used to. I average 27 mpg and 32 on the highway doing 70-75. Nav is fast, accurate and easy, Bose radio rocks, steering and handling great. My speedometer is 3 mph fast and the front cupholders aren\\'t great - otherwise nothing compares for this 6\\'2\" 220 pounder A luxury car yet... My car is actually the Audi A6 2.0 TSI and it has what it takes to make it big among its German stablemates. The design flair is obvious; keep it conservative, but let it age with style. The build quality has improved from my 2000 Audi A6 with the feel of this car leaning more towards the A8 than it does to the A4. The handling is still nimble and oh so much fun in S-shift, especially when taking off at the lights. The Jekyll and Hyde personality shift is scary! The sound system is pure pleasure and adds to the ambience of the car... that is, until things start going wrong. 2007 Audi After 1 year and 11,500 Miles Took delivery Jan 28, 07. Car was delivered spiffy clean and sparkling. So far, no serious defects of any kind - rather amazing in a complex machine. Only a few minor complaints: front cupholders could use redesign - one is under the armrest, which needs to be lifted to use cupholder. Windshield wiper moisture sensors work but not precisely enough - you need to \"help\" them along sometimes. Occasionally, there is a very slight hesitation when starting up from idle - seems to have lessened as time goes by - maybe I am getting used to it?? Very slight rattle in glove box door- needs adjustment?. Thats IT!! This is a \"serious\" car - took fanatical attention to detail to build. Fun to drive. Delayed acceleration and squeaky brakes When I took delivery of my car and the brakes were very loud the salesman told me this was just a temporary problem and would go away-it has only been worse. Srevice dept reply-brakes squeak.  My 4 other vehicles do not have squeaky brakes.  The worst problem however is the delayed acceleration at slow speeds. I will not let other family members drive this car, it is not safe and again the service reps say that\\'s just the way it is! I will never buy another. I own 2 Lexuses and have had no problems that were not taken care of ditto that for the 2 BMWs. Audi\\'s indifference to these acknowledged problems is beyond belief. Blast to Drive and Style too I researched all german and japanese sedans in the $40,000 to $60,000 range and Audi was one of the last I drove.  I have been driving BMWs since the late 70s owning the 3 and 5 series. Audi\\'s A6 reliability got better reviews the last few years so I checked it out.  It\\'s very nimble, powerful and just plain fun to drive, plus it\\'s stylish.  Being a female, color is important and I love the amaretto interior.  Bose sound system cranks too.    A6 4.2 - A Blast to Drive! I\\'ve driven Acuras for 15 years (Vigor, TL) and loved them. My new 2007 A6 4.2 is my first German car, and I love it. I wanted a 4WD vehicle with large engine and room to fit my bike. I started looking at the BMW X5, Acura RL and MDX, and the Lexus RX. I liked the X5 a lot, but really preferred a sedan. When I discovered the A6 had 350 hp, beautiful interior, and an enormous trunk, I was in. My test drive sealed the deal. I\\'ve had the car for 6 weeks and 1,400 mi, and am loving every minute. It\\'s fun to drive with tons of power and lots of class. I\\'m sure I\\'ll feel some pain in the wallet for service, but Audi\\'s service contract eases that a bit. A big thumbs-up for Audi! A Must Drive Excellent design inside and out (understated class). At home at the market or country club. Fit and finish is incredible. The 18\" wheels look the best and are surprisingly smooth on the road. Would encourage wheel insurance though as they\\'re easy to nick and scuff. Interior screams luxury - well appointed and roomy. MMI control is much easier to learn than critics say.Upgraded Bose audio is concert hall quality with the surround sound selection. Bluetooth works like a dream. Adaptive headlights are very bright. Good acceleration and braking. Quattro AWD gives excellent handling. Tight turning radius for a big car. Trunk is deep and the back seats fold down (!) easily holding golf bags. Perfect design and performance This is a spectacular car, its handling is excellent, and it grips the road like no other car. It is the nicest design, interior and exterior in its class. Very smooth on the road for the front seats, and has been a very reliable car so far. I drive a lot, it has 16000 miles in less then a year, and so far it has not gone for service except for the regular maintenance. Great AWD as well, drives in the snow beautifully, doesn\\'t slip or slide. Great job Audi.      Great as usual Excellent car.  Have had several Audis.  This is the best, even though the others were excellent.  It delivers on all levels This is a very impressive car.  Love the power in sport mode.  Build quality is awesome.  Traded a 2006 A3 2.0 with DSG.  I miss the lightning quick paddles and DSG would be a great addition to this vehicle.  The trunk is huge.  I have not tested this, but I am guessing that I could fit 4 golf bags in it.  Can\\'t wait to burn up the miles.   Always in need of repairs. Since purchase, the car presented steering and eletrical problems. Audi USA claims the vehicle is operating to specs. It drifts left and right. Several alignments and hundreds of dollars later, I just got used to the way it behaves. Electrical problems include warning lights that will not go off. Stereo not working. MMI malfunction. Undercarriage plastic protection ripped off with RAIN WATER. Plastic parts wear off too fast. The AWD feature is very nice and helps with the handling. The interior is very nice. Hopefully Audi will master their product eventually. I will not be a repeat buyer though. Front bumper comes off when parking. S Line package and 4.2 V8 are AMAZING This car does everything well.  The technology integrated into the vehicle and build quality are superb.   I love it!!! This car is soooo awesome. It drives like a dream. The luxury amenities are truly luxurious. The nav is awesome. The capability of calling friends by voice command and bluetooth technology will allow me to never get a ticket. It is so beautiful both on the inside and the outside. I am having so much fun figuring out how to use the console to its fullest potential. Perfect rendition of my vision of an LPS The Audi A6 3.2 Quattro S-Line virtually embodies my vision of what a luxury performance sedan should be. Quattro four-wheel-drive provides incredible control, handling, and steering through curves and around corners. S-Line suspension gives \"on-rails\" feeling. Averaging 22 mpg, while driving it \"passionately.\" Stunning and comfortable interior, with full array of electronics: excellent bluetooth (Treo 700p worked from the start); navigation system (small additional display in front of driver allows larger screen to be freed from map-use), which has been dead-on accurate; wonderful climate system and heated seats bottoms and backs. I love looking at it. Best Bang for your Quarta! The first thing that is great about the car is its elegant interior, I\\'ve owned BMWs and Lexus and MBZs and they all come in a distant second to the interior.  The sure footedness of its all wheel drive makes it a fun car to drive, yet not stiff and rugged like it\\'s german relatives.  This vehicle is not the quickest off the line but the real world does not live in the 0-60 realm, it is in real driving situations where this car exceeds expectations.  The MMI took a while to learn, but who needs it when you have the voice activated commands? Big jump from my old Jeep Grand Cherokee Fast, quiet, responsive, well appointed, bells and whistles aside, I love going to work now. The mountain freeway I drive to and from work is fun now, for the first time in 25 years.  It\\'s taking me a little time getting used to the differences of driving from my old car, and 1995 Jeep, where my legs go down in from of me and the steering wheel isn\\'t between my knees. The 2007 A6 is a race car. It hunkers down into turns asking me to push the gas peddle a little further down, as if it wants to go faster. The car has a quality that puts it in a class with any other more expensive car on the road. Consumer reports for the 2007 Audi A6 will be all good, I believe. I couldn\\x92t be more impressed. 2007 4.2 S line A6 I agonized over this car for months Audi vs BMW vs Lexus vs Acura... I am defiinitely very happy. The V8 is quick off the line but is more appreciated when passing on the freeway. S line handling and paddle shifter are fun but not mandatory. New addition is the review camera - which becomes important in the city (bumpers not made for love taps). Interior comfort very similar to the A8. The car is awesome. The Nav is easier to use than BMW. Decent mpg for a V8.  The brakes could be a more responsive.  Apparently they didn\\'t make too many of the V8 A6s - usually are ordered only - and so you wind up paying more for it (just 1k under MSRP) but is definitely worth it.  Test drive before you buy It\\'s very noisy on a highway and harsh ride blistering acceleration but with unreliable We purchased our 2016 3.0T prem plus A6 in June, 2016. A month later, the in dash screen went dark and only would powered up again after turning the car off and restarting after 15 minutes. This happened again every 5-6 months. Dealers said they could not replicate the issue.  In March 2018, the car stalled on a busy highway, completely locked up and luckily we were not harmed.  The steven creek dealership kept it for 3 days and said they could not replicate the problem.  I turned off the auto start system, the transmission started to lurch and engine speed can rumble at low speed as if it might stall again intermittently. Given that  our 2008 A4, 2011 A6, 2011 Q5 were burning 1 qt of oil every 5000miles was somehow we were told that this was \\'normal,\\' and the eventual diesel gate (the former VW CEO has been charged with defrauding VW customers and the US), we have decided to get rid of this Audi A6 and leave the VW/Audi brand altogether because we value our lives. 2016 Audi It is a gorgeous car Unpleasant Ownership Experience Various electrical features operated intermittently/randomly, the transmission has poor/lurching upshift quality at less than full throttle (where it does better) for which we were told there is no update/repair, brakes deteriorated/warped very early and Audi refused warranty. Based on this experience, I am a \"never again\" for anything Audi/VW. Had MB...will head back to BMW. Our 4th Audi I just replaced my 2012 A6 Premium Plus with this 2016 A6 Prestige.  Incredible performance and fun to drive.  Got the sport package on both which lowers the car 22mm and stiffens the suspension but what a difference in handling! Beautiful Car! I bought my 2016 Audi A6 Prestige with 12000 miles as an Audi Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle.  The warranty is great and the original owner purchased the select care package (good for 4 years maintenance) which carried over to me!  The car is one sweet ride!  It looks fantastic, is sleek, quick, and loaded with tech sure to please the tech-savvy driver.  I\\'m very pleased with my deal and can\\'t say enough about the customer experience at the Greenville, SC Audi dealership.  I highly recommend this vehicle...it\\'s a blast to drive! Audi review Can\\'t go wrong First Audi I bought this Audi after extensive research and driving A4\\'s as rentals. I had a poor impression of Audi in the past. When I drove the first one I was surprised how fast I found myself driving without even noticing, no noise, no fuss, just effortless acceleration. (previous car had 370 hp). Audi is a car you discover slowly. And the more you drive it, the more you enjoy it. I would start with complaints first: at this level, the car is missing some basic equipment found on much cheaper vehicles: rear cross traffic alert, Apple/Android Car Play. I think the windshield chips a bit too easy and so is the paint. The Bose sound system is good but not outstanding. My previous Genesis had a better sound(Lexicon). The electronics are somewhat fussy and distracting. But when it comes to driving pleasure and performance, this car is outstanding, it moves so fast with such ease, it\\'s quiet, planted on the road like it is on rails. It has an intrinsic elegance and a remarkable presence.Update: almost a year later, I keep enjoying this car more and more. Long trips are a breeze. Passing other vehicles or merging on highway is super easy and fun. No malfunction. Bose sounds better after some adjustments. Audi added another year of free internet access. Comfort and quietness are excellent. Complaints: the screen that comes out of the dash is a gimmick, I worry the mechanism will brake in the future. Also the kill engine at stops is very annoying, this is what one of my first cars used to do, only it won\\'t start when pressing the gas pedal. Brings back stressful memories :-). Hidden tiger A visual esthetic high performance car.Update 2018Sadly, I had to trade in the car for a Q7.  Though there were no issues with the car itself, my surfboard wax was ruining the leather seats.   Thus, the switch to a suv.  The Q7 has the same motor as the A6 but not as quick or eyecatching. What you really need to know before you buy I have two major issues with the A6. First is the extremely annoying stop-start of the engine each time you stop the car for a traffic light, stop sign, heavy traffic, etc. You can turn off the feature if you remember to do so each time you get into the car, but you will often forget. Even with the feature turned off you can \"feel\" the engine thinking of turning off. I absolutely hate this feature and will not buy another vehicle with it. The second issue relates to the very low feature of the tires. There are only a few inches between the road and rim. I\\'ve had two blow outs because of the narrow space between road and rim. One blowout was from hitting a curb and another from a pot hole. Both situations would not have happened with regular height tires. At about $300 a replacement, this is a very expensive problem. Heaven on Wheels Still in love with my 2016 Audi A6 Prestige quattro. I fell in love with the aesthetics, but the performance and well-appointed interior sold me. It was definitely a superior vehicle hands down, albeit pricier, worth every penny. My initial criticism was that the interior plastic components are relatively delicate therefore I wouldn\\'t recommend it for families with young children\\'s wandering hands. After nearly 2 years of ownership my only criticism would be that the transmission can be not as smooth as one would wish at times. Make no mistake, this unassuming sedan is a rocket, particular in dynamic mode. It coners well even for being slightly nose heavy. Lastly, it\\'s not so fuel thirsty despite its 333 hp supercharged V6. LOVE MY CAR!! I am 40 this year, a single mom, successful with a 7 yr old boy. This car is so safe, sexy, fast and comfortable! My heart skips a beat every time I see it! You pay way for way overpriced Honda Accord I got this car all excited by the Audi name. First, the engine is very loud, even when you close the windows you can still hear the engine, comparing it to my wife\\'s MB E350, huge difference. The ride is rough, even on the most comfortable setting, especially if you sit in the backseat. Everytime we go out as a family, the kids would run to my wife\\'s car. I am really disappointed at the infotainement system. Search and scrolling through the setting is so antique, I wish they can learn from Tesla or Volve how to make the infotainment system user friendly: easy to use and attractive.  I don\\'t think I will be keeping the car beyond its waranty, God knows what else Audi was misleading the customers in their products. Audi A6 2.0T Premium Plus Love It, Totally!I\\'ve had this car for 8 months now and could not love it more!1 year in - I love it even more! Good Buy  Third Time is NOT the Charm This is my third A6. I loved my other two and actually went to a new dealership for the third and had a wonderfully helpful sales person. The third one is the best looking of my three and I was so ready to love it. I hate it. Literally, the worst car I have had since my first BMW 7 series. I bought the prestige model with all the technology packages including the heads up display and driver assist. Truly, almost nothing works right. I can\\'t input addresses into the GPS, the brake assist never works, it rattles like the frame is not welded onto the frame, the phone system and voice activation never gets names rights and I constantly loose calls that I am able to keep when driving the same route in my wife\\'s Mercedes. I have been on the phone with \\'Audi Experience\\' no less than 20 times. I have been through endless fights with service where I can demonstrate what is not working, take screen shots and they admit they cannot fix it. The regional service rep was going to call his software guy in Germany except the guy was on vacation. I think I will need to look into \\'lemon law\\' protection as this is intolerable. Going back to Mercedes or BMW. They are totally clueless. I went from being a loyal Audi fan to hating every day in the car. Buyer beware! Great to drive.  Very responsive. This A6 is one of the smoothest rides I have had.  Great acceleration and command of the road.  A joy to drive.  Great road handling.  Some quirky things with electronics.  Remote entry system and navigation system both have had components replaced under warranty.  Service has been exceptional.  Navigation database is often off regarding ETA.  Outside temperature readings are often higher than reported outside temps.  Told by service rep that it is probably due to engine temp affecting reading. Last car Explore all discounts Not bad, but still disappointed Coming from 5-series BMW I see a few faults in this car: horrible gas mileage for a 2 liter engine! I\\'m getting about 12 mpg in traffic with rather conservative driving habits. Navigation system is OK, but certainly missing street routing and traffic display for local streets that I\\'m acostoumed to relay on for my daily commute. Engine vibration, while not a deal breaker, can be pretty annoying in stop and go traffic. Controls are less than intuitive (may be personal preference). Still in the honeymoon phase So far really enjoying the A6.  It\\'s the right size, looks terrific, a comfortable cruiser and the materials inside and out are top notch.  It\\'s really too early to comment about things like reliability, maintenance costs etc., but both my wife (the primary driver) and I feel good about the purchase.  The A6 replaces a Q5 which was our first Audi and the ownership experience was stellar.After 6 months we\\'re still enjoying the A6.  No issues at all.  A very solid car.  The ride might be a little firm for some, as ours has the sport suspension, but I enjoy the sharp steering and handling that comes with it.  One niggle is the placement of the HVAC controls.  They sit very low on the center stack and are difficult to see and adjust while driving.  Something used so frequently should be in a better location.  One option is to set the system to AUTO and forget about it - But at times things need to be tweaked.  Overall, a great car and deserving of the praise that\\'s it\\'s received.After 1 year we\\'re still enjoying the A6.  No issues at all as well as not creaks or rattles.  We\\'ve taken two long road trips and got 30+ mpg\\'s depending to the speed, terrain etc.  It\\'s a keeper.In June my 2016 A6 passed the 2 year mark.  The car continues to impress.  We\\'ve had zero issues with it with just routine service needed.  The car doesn\\'t have any creaks or rattles and still feels very solid.  With the sport suspension and the ride being on the firm side I keep the tire pressures at the minimum recommended and it is a good balance between ride and handling.  Overall a great car and a positive ownership experience.   I\\'ll take a look at the new gen 2019 when it comes out, although there are a couple of other cars on my radar as possible replacements. Techno Car A great driving car.  Handles well, great pick-up.  For those of you who are technologically challenged, there is a lot to learn about many of the features of the car.  We now have driven the car for about a year and are still bewildered by the technology offered by the vehicle. Nevertheless, it continues to be a wonderful car to drive. Audi A6 Nice car Can Handle all Kinds of Weather First thing my wife said as we were driving in a rain storm, WOW this car handles the bad weather great. It just does everything well and with ease, you will notice how well everything in the Audi\\'s function when you get into another car. I am surprised at the gas mileage, 32 on a 25 mile commute to work every day on a mix of highway and 2 lane hilly roads. Acceleration is great, friends shocked when I floor it. My second Audi, will be more.... Best car I\\'ve ever bought! Hands down this is the finest vehicle I\\'ve ever purchased. An absolute joy to drive in town or road trips. Audi Up This is my second A6 and I will probably buy another. This is a great road car, very comfortable on long trips. The interior and electronics are top notch. Buy the audi care for the first four services. It will save you you a lot of money. Audi makes a great car that is fun to drive. This  car is still great. No problems and going strong Best car I\\'ve ever had. Best car I\\'ve ever had. What a Car This car handles like a sports car on the back roads. You would never know it is a mid sized car. I have a BMW Z and it is second fiddle to this car. Acceleration is quick and gas mileage is in low thirties driving 70 mph. What\\'s not to like. Plenty of leg room in both front and back with a pretty good size trunk. The led headlamps are amazing. I have two other cars with HID, but no comparison. The car is just fun to drive and the driver assistance with lane tracking works great. It does tell you to put your hands on the steering wheel after about 15 seconds, but I just like checking it out. Before I purchased, I tried the E300 and the 535xi. The E300 was old fashioned, the acceleration was subpar and it did not feel as sharp in the handling. My wife was leaning towards the BMW 535XI until we drove the 3.0 A6. Then we drove them again and it was no contest. The BMW handling was nowhere as good as this A6. Loving it. First Audi, added another already. I\\'ve been in the automotive manufacturing sector ( worked for a major transplant automotive manufacturer in the 80\\'s and owned a supply company for 27 years ) so I\\'ve always had a love affair for great automobiles. I\\'ve admired the Audi\\'s for a few years, so once I retired and not now tied to a major customer auto brand, I traded my Lexus LS for the A6. I was impressed with the style, handling, driving dynamics, quality of manufacturing, interior materials, fit and finish, fuel economy, and layout. After 10,000 miles, I\\'m still as pleased as with day 1. This car is a pleasure to drive, has a conservative style, lots of power from the 3.0, quiet and fun to drive. You must get used to watching your speed. You can find yourself approaching triple digits on the highway without realizing it. At first, I hated the pop-up info display, but have warmed up to it nicely. Once your all set with climate control, music, etc., you can allow it to disappear, and the looks of the dash is so streamlined compared to the huge screens on most other luxury vehicles. Good sized rear seating, and trunk for a car of this size. Really like the Google Maps on the huge screen. Really slick to,see Google Earth exactly where you are driving, the buildings, landmarks, and interesting things just beyond your street view as you drive down a highway. The wifi is a nice addition for the passenger to enjoy as well. The choices found in the on screen system for adjusting the lighting, door locking, driving dynamics, Climate Control, entertainment, etc. is great. My wife liked my A6 so much, she got the A8L. The best luxury sedan If you are looking for a sports sedan, than this is it.  I have test driven all the German sedans (mid size)  and the CTs, and this is by far the best.  Fit and finish is exemplary. Ride is excellent and the transmission some how knows what you are thinking. I can go on and on, but really, if you are looking to purchase or lease one, you will not be sorry.Update after 41k miles....still zero issues and drives fantastic. Tires  are showing their age but I think I should get another 8 or 9 k miles out of them. Brakes are little soft now but still no issues. Completely satisfied with the car. Still a dream car after a 18 months.... Still loving it after all these months....18 to be exact, and still this A6 is a dream to drive, own and remains trouble free.  Even after the first year and half, the car has all of the  exuberance of new car ownership.  All that has changed is that I \"know\" it and its capabilities and amenities better and driving out the driveway each morning is perhaps a little less thrilling and is now more of a long time, settled-in, best friend car-owner relationship.  I have only one issue, and that is at times the Audi connect service (which enables you to go into many of the internet options, including navigation points entered from your home computer) sometimes requires me to re-enter my PIN and is every now and then slower than I would like (but these are minor and few and far between occurrences.)  The only other thing that I have learned from time is that the front under-bumper spoiler IS LOW, and you have to be very careful about parking up against concrete parking stops.  I had a major run-in with one, and it caused enough under bumper damage for me to take it to the body shop for (a not in-expensive) repair/replace.  (This is user error, but users be aware.)  The car sails on smoothly, responsively and with the same youthful eagerness that it did when I first drove it off the dealer\\'s lot.  I will most likely be keeping this 2016 A6 for several years, and my next car will be another Audi, probably an A6, with autonomous (self-driving) capabilities!  The sad part of that will be missing out on the wonderful human driving experience that this current A6 provides. Traded In My \\'14 For A New \\'16 For the first time in my life, did I decide to go Diesel. I had NO IDEA of the stats for cars equipped with Diesel Engines. i.e. I didn\\'t know they have a higher value, higher (MUCH) higher gas mileage.I enjoyed my \\'14 A6 - THAT MUCH, that I just went and traded that in for a new \\'16. (Faster MMI/Console MUCH better resolution on the screen - that \"techie\" list goes on and on, though I have to admit, it\\'s the \"techie\" stuff that sells me.)One final note: (Added 7/20/16) I know the Audi A6 3.0 liter Diesel is one of \"those.\" (VW Diesel Engine Scam?) Not only do I _REALLY_ not place much concern on that issue, but Audi is making GOOD on the deal. I\\'ve already received \"some\" compensation (without EVEN asking for it) and according to the news/media there\\'s more, a LOT more, coming BACK into my wallet. So after reading that last note, you can certainly see that Audi is a company that is \"making good\" on THIS customer\\'s experience.  Heck, and the car is even MORE \\'techie\\' than my \\'14. Once you experience the safety Audi is building into these models using technology, you\\'ll NEVER go back. It IS \"The Audi\" in my opinion that has the \"most\" bang for the buck when it comes to the built-in safety features of that car using technology. (Quick Example: Looking at the camera views when backing up, there is a portion of the screen that it APPEARS to be a camera that\\'s sitting ~ 20 feet above the car so you can see ALL around the vehicle.) The \"Adaptive Cruise\" that will STOP YOU if you get too close to the car in front of you or the vehicle in front makes a sudden stop - your brakes WILL be applied and you will NOT hit the car in front of you. I assure you - there are 10\\'s of other (safety) reasons Audi has built into this unit just not enough room here in this forum to share them all with you. There are just SO many other technical features built-into that vehicle and my writing I know cannot possibly do it enough justice. Bottom Line: I\\'ve owned MANY, practically a new one EACH year since \\'09 of higher value vehicles all 3 manufacturers come from Germany. Bar-None! If Audi keeps up doing what it\\'s doing, I will have NOTHING but new Audis in my future purchasing plans for the next xx years. I TRULY enjoy the Audi twice as much as the \"other\" German car, and three times as much as the Bavarian. Purchased Used with 62k miles Bought this off the lot with 62k miles on it. This will be my daily driver. Purchased for it\\'s all weather capability and european refinement. For a 10 year old car this one is in fairly good shape. Some gremlins do plague the car, phantom sunroof, power steering pump went in the first 20 days and driver side rear window does not work. But this is part and parcel for a 10 year old car. It is also a heavy drinker. 18 around town and 22-24 highway on premium gas. Beyond these nuances the car is capable, comfortable, solid on the road and for the money drives better than most newer cars and has more cargo space than most SUVs.  Worst car ever Vehicle started leaking oil and running rough at less than 12k. Dealer would not repair. Finaly after many complaints, dealer found coolant was leaking into the head gaskets. Short story is dealer has had the head gaskets out 3 separate times to \\'resurface\\', car still leaking oil, repaired that several times. I was told the car is like a piece of cheese, when one hole is fixed, another opens up! That must be professional mechanic speak. Car has been in 29 times for serious repair in less than 2 years. Best on market, get one while you can! Prior auto was 2001 A6 2.8 Front \\rTrack \"Celebration Package\" - It was \\rentry level but got me in the door.  \\rWas impressed by warranty support. My \\rlease was up and my 2004 Avant was \\rsitting on the lot - it was meant to \\rbe.  \\r Quattro is AMAZING!  I found myself in \\rthe left lane being tailgated by a \\rtrucker - Tiptronic - from 75 to 85 in \\rnothing flat to get myself out of a \\rbad situation.  The Michelins and \\rQuattro were like rails. \\r Needless to say, the best safety \\rfeature is a car capable of getting \\ryou out of a bad situation before it \\roccurs. Audi A6 Avant Excellent automobile that my family  Looks Great, Drives even better! This is my 3rd Audi A6, my first one \\rwas a 96 Avant, the 2nd one a 00 \\rSedan, I missed the cargospace, so i \\rbought the 04 Avant. Drives great, \\rhandling is good.

My A6 Avant is a sporty and versatile \\ralternative to an SUV, more fun to \\rdrive, gets better gas mileage, and is \\rnicer looking.

Model Update Needed I have owned 4 A6\\'s and find the new  Stage 3 black \"s-6\" Initially, with low miles, there was no need to do any maintenance other than brakes and oil changes. After 40,000+ miles (approx. 125,000-130,000 on the odometer) expect the turbos to have issues especially if you\\'re a spirited driver. Cost to repair is ridiculous if you aren\\'t mechanically inclined. By this I mean a pro with engine lift experience, patience and an extreme love for the car. If not, expect to spend thousands more than the thousands the parts will cost you. I went stage 3+ when my turbos blew (passenger side to be specific, and also the timing belt) . After tackling the job on this car I have full confidence that I can fix any and all of the issues I may ever have. If you have the know how and the ambition this car is amazing and the engineering, when understood is truly awesome! Help, please send money! Love it. Just wish I didn\\'t have to put so much money in it. When it rains it pours. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. Could be an awesome car. Love working on it (a lot). Everything is a pain to get to. Nothing is simple.  I do love my car though. I guess because I am still paying on it. Pre-owned yields luxury at a reasonable price I\\'ve driven ~40,000 miles since I bought it at ~67,000 miles.  I\\'m 6\\'5\", and most other cars don\\'t fit me well. This car is comfortable, roomy, and has a nice, big trunk. I love the all wheel drive, especially in the winter. This car has been remarkably reliable for me. (Hope I didn\\'t just jinx myself!)  I had the timing belt service including water pump etc. performed at the prescribed mileage. I\\'ve replaced the battery, brake pads and rotors and tires, and a couple of front end alignments. The only non-regular maintenance items I\\'ve had to do is replacing is a tie rod end and both front axles, all due to torn rubber boots at the ball joint and CV-joints, respectively. At its age, I can\\'t really complain. None of the work was done by the dealer. This is an Audi after all, so expect to pay more for work and parts than on other cars. I\\'ve had good luck with a couple of local independent mechanics. The 2.7 liter bi-turbo is nice and peppy when needed. I usually buy this class of car with more than a couple of years on it. Since I like a firm, responsive ride I\\'ll usually start by investing in shocks and struts all around, but this car has handled beautifully from the get-go and right up to the present, so I still have the original suspension components.  Fuel consumption isn\\'t great by today\\'s standards: about 21 mpg around town, and 26 on the highway, and I drive rather carefully.A common problem on a used Audi is oil leaks around the engine. Oftentimes the leak is above the exhaust manifold so drips or runs down to vaporize and stink. I haven\\'t had this problem, but be mindful of this issue. Another issue I need to point out, NOT related to this car but on any Audi with the 2 liter, 4 cylinder turbo engine built roughly between 2006 - 2013. This engine has a very serious problem with oil consumption. It\\'s not leakage. It simple burns it at the rate of a quart every 600 to 1500 miles. It\\'s a widely known issue. My wife\\'s 2007 A4 Avant has this problem. Of course we learned about it after we bought it. Response from the seller, \"It\\'s always done it.\" From the dealer, \"They all do it.\" Both are right. Caveat emptor.I find it curious to say the least that Audi, a German company that otherwise makes beautifully engineered cars, hasn\\'t figured out to make an oil seal that lasts, either external, the dripping, or internal, the burning of oil.Would I buy another one? Most likely. I like the overall feel. Great Car This is my 2nd Audi and with one exception, it\\'s been my favorite. Did have to replace transmission \"computer\" chip outside of warranty and they don\\'t come cheap. On the other hand the car has provided wonderful service, It\\'s stylish, comfortable, quiet, reliable and gets exceptional milage - 22 to 24 in town and 30 to 32 on the road at 70 mph. I am, however, a geezer driver - as my children tell me - so I don\\'t flog either the engine or brakes. Phenomenal Car Bought the \\'04 S-line in Sept \\'09 with 55k miles on it. Mint condition for 15k. Could not be happier! added APR chip to get HP to 310 and it really makes  a difference. Used to have 3 series BMW and this blows it away. Build quality is so much better. best vehicle i\\'ve ever driven in foul weather (snow, rain). Very safe feeling in all situations. One thing i learned is Dealers will kill you on repairs. got to find an indy tech. watch out for the cam adjuster seal leak\\' DLR scam. they claim its $1200 in labor. only takes them 2 hrs! find an independent mechanic or get warranty. wonderful car. had not problems at 72k miles yet. Once you go QUATTRO you cant go back! This is the best piece of man made machine I have ever driven. I drove Infiniti G35\\'s and Nissan 350Z and then had two hondas and one gm. Of all those cars, I can say this is in its own category and nothing comes to close to the performance and comfort and style and OH YOU HAVE A NICE CAR comments. MY next car will be an A8L but I will enjoy every bit of my A6. Every time I start the engine and hear the muffler noise (modified) I just cant wait to hit on the gas pedal and accelerate. The feel is way beyond anything I can ever own and AFFORD to own. 20k$ Audi 3.0 FWD I purchased my audi 3.0 FWD two years ago used (had 25K miles on it at the time).  I was surprised with the average gas mileage(averaged 26.4 mpg) over the past two years.  On the down side, I spent a lot of time in the shop for small items (some covered by warranty).  Repairs included new battery, 4 cv boots, head light, two tail lights.  On average I spent $1,200 per year in repairs not including oil changes, brakes and tires/rotations.  Overall interior quality was less than I expected.  The seats showed significant wear, the radio/heating buttons writing wore off and the wood (plastic) cracked during my two years of ownership.  I previously owned a saab 9-5 and had none of these problems. Nice, Costly Family Sportster I bought this car from pampering owner.  I had a \\'98 A8 10yrs ago that I prefer. The car looks awesome but I find myself nickel and diming my way through ownership of this Audi too.  Both of my 5 series BMW\\'s and my two Volvo\\'s (S60 & S80) were much less expensive to own.  I hit a small deer at 20 mph that cost 5K to repair- chalk 1 for the dealer. Can\\'t seem to get the ride completely smooth and the dealership always finds something.  The car is not as fast off the line as the engine sounds, but it is great on the highway. Big gas tank is great for trips and the highway mpg is great--especially compared to the dismal in-city driving with a heavy foot.  Overall- not sure it\\'s worth it. AMAZING I just bought this car at the beginning of the week, but did a lot of reviews on it, and they were all very good. I LOVE the car so far.  I can\\'t wait until this winter to try out the AWD!  I just wish the gas mileage was a bit better, but it\\'s ok for how amazing the car is! 2004 model year has the best reliability I\\'m the 2nd owner off lease.  I\\'ve been driving it for 2 years now.  First couple of months the car was stock and throttle response a bit dead.  I had the ECU chipped and it really livened it up.  Plus gas mileage is a couple per gallon better (not great about 20 MPG combined city / hwy).  I\\'ve tinted the windows and added aftermarket wheels to the otherwise boring design of the 18\" S- Line stockers.  Oil lines to the turbos were updated for 2004 so no more blown turbos (one goes you\\'ve got to replace the other)!  Ride is very nice and not too harsh.  S-Line A6 2.7t\\'s aren\\'t on every corner so you feel like you\\'re in a more exclusive club.  Love the car...luxury and sportiness all in one! AUDIOS to BMW and Mercedes! Having owned 3 Audis this is by far the best one... quality, comfort, speed, all weather capable... what more is there! This Audi beats BMW and Mercedes... hands down... the only downfall is the HIGH maintenance costs. But every car is high to maintain these days. LUXURY & sport for 20k If you\\'re dumb enough to buy a $50k car and complain that it costs a lot to maintain (when you only paid 20k for it) then shame on you.  This is a phenomenal car and beats the pants off any comparable, or even brand new, car you can get for ~20k.   I\\'ve had 2 and loved them both. (148k miles, and 22k miles) The car is fast, comfortable, reliable (if you keep it up), and an awesome daily driver. Another Great Audi Product. We were needing to get something a little larger than our A4.  I looked at Caddys, Jags, Beemers, Mercs and Inf.  There was always something about them that made them either feel very dated on the inside (Jag, Merc, BMW) or cheap on the inside (Inf, Caddy).  When I first looked at the A6 I looked at the 3.0 CVT model, but heard many negs about the CVT.  Decided to risk the turbos and step up to the 2.7T S-Line as it wasn\\'t much more money on the used market.  I am so pleased with my decision.  The car is beautiful inside and out.  It performs great in all conditions.  Decent fuel economy.  I haven\\'t loved a car as much as this one since my 1993 & 97 Infiniti J30.  And this car blows em away. Worth It Bought the car for my wife and we both love it.  The ride is great, and the cabin is first class.  When I walk by it I can\\'t help but stare at it.  Had one problem bad brake light switch caused alarms, but $100 fix.  Now I\\'m looking for the A6 4.2 V8 for me.  Mercedes are so bland and BMW\\'s are ugly.  If you want a great car that makes you happy every time you drive it, buy Audi. Extra Performance is Easy! This is a great car for any family. The added bonus (for dad or mom) is the easy modification. I have added a GIAC perfromance chip, cold air intake and better turbo valves. This car easily outruns a Mustang GT in the straight line and on the track. It is fun to pass so-called \"sports cars\" with my son\\'s car-seat in the back. Exceptional Automobile Have owned Volvos, Benz, Bimmers, you name it; our 2004 S-line A6 has been the best handling, most reliable auto ever. Chicago winters, no problem. Many x-country trips in every season. The car has never once let us down. Minor electronic nuisance with turn signal relay, but that\\'s it. Developed outside water leak in front passenger floor area which we still haven\\'t tracked down, but what the hey...shopping for a nice all road with the same mechanicals as we need more room to carry stuff with a new business. Highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market. So far, so good! Love the look and, so far, love the car. Purchased used with 8 months remaining on warranty which provided a little peace of mind. Nearest dealer is 70 miles away but so far that has not proven to be an issue. Previously owned a 1984 Audi 5000 with manual transmission that I loved but didn\\'t care for the high cost of maintenance and repair. I put more than 240k miles on it before I traded. This newer one is substantially more sophisticated than the 1984 version and, I hope, more reliable. Have been amazed by in-town gas mileage which averages over 22 mpg in town to go with a respectable 30 mpg on the highway. I do drive conservatively and plan to keep the A6 for a long time. Awesome Car while on warranty I have owned two Audi A6 2.7 S lines. The car handles great and has a sleek look. You can\\'t beat the sophisticated interior and the features are extremely well thought out. However, if you intend to buy this car without an warranty or extended warranty beware! I have been to the shop too many times. I know all the technicians by name and could give you their family histories. Electronic problems, oil leakage, bad gaskets, transmission, transmission, transmission. Did I mention transmission. I love the car, but I\\'m going japanese from here. good luck.  Most fun car I have ever owned This car is the 29th registered in my name. Love the style, motor, and creature comforts. Great acceleration, comfortable on my frequest long drives. Seems to have a great build quality. Bought it certified, definitely the way to go. Black on black with S-line, cold weather, and all the creature comforts. I get stopped all the time by people commenting on it. Not bad considering the new body style in 05 The best of the best This is honestly the best car I have ever owned. I bought it with 45000 as a CPO and haven\\'t looked back. No issues at all so far and I just keep loving it more and more as the days go on.  You will not find a better all wheel drive system out there. This past winter was a breeze driving around, it literally feels like your on rails.   A ver different German Experience After owning an E55 AMG this Audi seems a bit slow by comparison.  The ride quality is exceptional however the overall handling is not up to par with other \"sports sedans\". I am impressed with most of what this car has to offer. I am not a big fan of the \"quattro\" system however, living in No. California there really is no need for \"AWD\".  I wish that Audi would offer their cars with \"rear wheel drive\" and quattro.  This is a fine car for anyone seeking a high line luxury used car. I would recommend the Audi extended warranty with any used German car you consider purchasing.  There is just too much that can go wrong with these highly technical vehicles. Love this car Interior build is A. Feels like true luxury car. Great handling/cornering. Family feels safe in this car. Poor Man\\'s RS6. I have been a fan of the RS6 model since it came out. Then Audi decided to make a \"S-Line\" A6 twin turbo V6. This is a terrific car to own (provided you protect your investment and buy the extended warranty!)  I found that owning this beautiful sedan is really a pleasure. While I don\\'t need the \"quattro\" feature here in Northern CA. Other than that, I really enjoy the engine\\'s performance, the elegant euro design inside and out and the ride quality and quiet driving experience. All in all I highly recommend owning this fine sedan if \"European Sporty Luxury\" is something you are looking for. Rolling artwork I have owned over 40 vehicles, mostly new German cars. This Audi 2.7T S- Line luxury sedan is just that, luxury. While most think of it as a sport sedan, the fact is its handling, braking power, and ride quality is much more \"luxury\" than sport. That\\'s ok however, because Audi delivers on that. I am highly impressed with how quiet the interior is while driving at freeway speed. Also, the ride quality is exceptional. If you are looking for a sports sedan, purchase a BMW.  If you are looking for comfort and rolling artwork down the road, this car is the one! Mike\\'s 2004 A6 2.7T Quattro Subtle yet elegant.  That\\'s what I would say about this car.  Nothing is overdone or classless.  Audi has an incredible job of making this car appealing to those seeking both practical and luxurious features in a car.  Flight controls are easy to get to, flat-dash experience doesn\\'t alienate the passengers, incredible handling, very quiet and stable feel, and details in the rear of the car like wood trim, ashtray and cup-holders. Audi A6 2.7T S-Line I was looking for an all-wheel drive car and after taking the A6 for a test drive I liked it much better than the G35X Infiniti, the ride and interior were way better. The S-Line has the Bose, XM radio, heated front and rear seat, and handles great, and has great passing power. Gas mileage has been in about 25 mpg on highway.  Fantastic Performance Luxury Sedan I have been a past BMW 5 Series driver, but this Audi A6, blows the BMW out of the water in terms of sheer performance and reliability!!  No question about it!  The Audi A6 acceleration is exceptionally quick, quicker than the BMW.  The interior is more upscale and the appointments are more lavish and luxurious.  I love the fact that there is both a CD player and a cassette player. I still have motivational tapes.  There are plenty of extras: side pockets and compartments and five solid cup holders!  Quality workmanship and great body and interior integrity. Elegance in Motion I\\'ve owned this car for almost 3 years now.  I\\'m extremely impressed. Have driven friends\\' and relatives\\' BMWs.  This car is better.  The AWD is awesome, even when it\\'s dry.  What\\'s even more impressive are the twin turbos.  I live at high altitude. They are a must up here.  Passes 99% of everything on the highway and still gets 28 mpg.  Reliability has been great.  Can\\'t beat the looks either. Seductive I sit behind the wheel and I feel empowered. Heated leather seats with memory. Red illumination for the dashboard. Soft on the eyes! I do not regret this purchase. This is my third used Audi purchase in a row. The interior is my kind of fine appointment. The leather seats hold up just fine. I like the roomy trunk space.  I always take my car for regular scheduled maintenance, therefore I have never had a suprise disruption. I like the peppy engine response when traveling down the interstate. I have always appreciated the sexy curves and distinct appearance of an Audi. How can you not feel regal sporting around town in a fine German sedan? Audi A6 4.2 AWD - Too much power I love the car!! I have had it for 2 years and it is awesome. I sometime wonder if it has too much power. I hit triple digits plenty of times, but the reality is I just don\\'t have anywhere to really run it to its potential. 2004 A6 S-Line Plush interior and sleek exterior make for the ideal sedan.  I considered the Infinity G-35 and various BMW\\'s, but chose the A6 without any difficulty.  I am most impressed with the \"fit and finish\" of the Audi-  the doors are solid, the trim is rich and well put together, but my above all, the design is unmatched. A6 S-type...Hot Extra horsepower is noticable.  Rides on rails.  Excellent in all road conditions.  One of the best temp control systems in the automotive world.  Hot/cold very quickly.  Makes you grin when you push it. Rocket Ship I owned a A4 with the 1.8T and quattro, and it was absolutely gutless.  I liked Audi\\'s build quality though, and decided to get another, just with more power, and I am throughly impressed!  It accelerates so effortlessly, and is almost as fast as my father\\'s 2005 Mercedes SL500!  I would highly recommend this car. Great Car Powerful engine and great handling in straight line and around corners. With Dunlop winter sport tires, great traction in snow and handles better than my previous AWD Grand Cherokee,Subaru and 4Runner.  Interior is high quality and very comfortable.  Best Kept Secret in Luxury Autos The Audi A6 3.0 is designed for speed and  My 1st Audi A6 I am extremely pleased with my new A6  \\r2.7T  S Line.  The car has great \\racceleration & you can feel the turbo \\rkick in at 3,000 RPMS.  So far I found \\rthe car very comfortable and with no \\rproblems.  Like most others in these \\rreviews I too find the cupholder to be \\rtoo small.  I understand Audi improved \\rthis in the new 2005 model.  Handling \\ron this car is amazing.  I find the \\rseating to be comfortable and my \\rchildren really enjoy the heated seats \\rin the back.  I really like the 6 disc \\rin-dash cd player.  One last \\rthing...the trunk is huge & with fold-\\rdown seats it has all the utility room \\rI need.  I can\\'t wait till the snow \\rcomes down to try the AWD.   4TH Audi Great handling and performance.  Well  Audi comfort and safety We first experienced the Quattro as a \\rcompany car in Toronto, ON.  We noticed \\rthat we  could safely drive our Audi in \\rthe winter when BMW and Mercedes owners \\rwere not able to make it up hills in a \\rcity where snow removal is done after \\rmost of the storm has passed.\\r We love the cockpit and the comfortable \\rseats for highway driving.  The A6 is a \\rgreat balance between road feel and \\rsmooth ride.\\r The Audi is a must drive if you are \\rshopping in this price range. Beats BMW/Volvo Only 2wks but love this car! Drove BMW \\r525 (same price range) and was NOT \\rimpressed. Would have to spend more $$$ \\rfor a 545 to match the HP and perf. of \\rof the 2.7S. Heavenly cabin w/quality \\rmaterials, tight build and responsive \\rhandling. Not For the \"Me Too\" Crowd  My Audi A6 S Line 2.7t Quattro is a \\rstand-out car in all respects.  It\\'s \\rinterior and exterior both scream \\runiqueness, sport-luxury and quality.  \\rThis is my second Audi A6 and the 04 \\ris better than my 01.  \\r I\\'ve got all the get-up-and-go I could \\rever need for over-taking and freeway \\rmerging and the Quattro 4 wheel drive \\rprovides that extra road handeling \\rcompetence that you just have to \\rpersonally experience to fully \\rappreciate.  I mean slot-car like road \\rholding around corners.\\r When you punch the gas, the torque \\rjust keeps pulling and pulling and \\rbefore you know it, you\\'re just going \\rtoo damn fast!   Fun, sexy, fast, and still practical! I\\'ve really enjoyed this car so far.  \\rIt drives great, it\\'s very quick and \\rsporty when you want it, yet can be \\rvery civil for daily commuting.  When \\ryou add AWD to the mix, I don\\'t think \\rthere\\'s a comparison at this level.  \\rNot to mention it\\'s beautiful and has \\ran understated sexiness BMW and MB \\rdon\\'t have.  The only quibbles are a \\rfew squeaks/rattles that had to be \\rironed out, the seats are a little too \\rfirm, and the sound system isn\\'t the \\rbest in class.  Those things aside, I \\rlove this thing.  I\\'ve test driven \\reverything from a Corvette to a BMW M3, \\rand things in between... this thing has \\rthe best of all worlds.  Best car \\rpurchase in 10 years. A6 Owner I absolutely LOVE this car! You have \\rto test drive it before you buy \\ranything else. It handles extremely \\rwell, no surprise since Audi is \\rtraditionally a racing car. Total \\rluxury inside and out, smooth ride, \\rand great value overall. the b review this car runs great.  although mileage \\rin not good on side roads, freeway \\rmileage is great. Great blend of performance and style I entered a lease on the s-line going \\rfrom a 1999 BMW 740i sport.  \\rPerformance and handling are very \\rclose to the BMW with the added \\rbenefit of AWD. Moving to much more \\rsevere winters, hence AWD.  The \\rinterior lived up to Audi\\'s reputation \\rfor quality in colors, wood, etc.  \\rDealers are offering lower than \\rinvoice with excellent lease rates \\rgiven the new model coming.  Recommend \\rthe leather upgrade with sport seats--\\rside bolstering needed for driving at \\rthe limit and the upgrade is a major \\rimprovement over the standard Left over 2004 quite a bargain!! Just picked up a A6 Quattro 3.0 \\ryesterday.  Prem, cold pkgs., and 17\" \\rwheels and tires.  $2500 incentive plus \\r$1000 Audi Loyalty got me out the door \\rat $35300.  Edmunds you missed the \\rincentives!!!  Thank goodness they \\rwanted to move the \\'04\\'s A6 3.0 CVT At first it was a little strange getting\\rused to the new type of transmission. I\\rtike the tiptronic gear shift for\\rdriving up the mountain roads. the\\rhandling of curves is fun and safe. I\\rnow find that the pickup of the car is\\rmuch better than the 2.7T. It has\\raveraged about 23 mpg since I got the\\rcar with over 26,000 mile on it. Audi A6 Sumptious interior, understated \\relegance, quiet cabin, powerful engine \\rand solid smooth ride are the \\rcharastics of my A6.  Build quality \\rteutonic, I have no complaints.  Dealer \\rservice is terrific the few times \\rneeded. over priced   My 2001 has had no major but many, \\rmany problems.  Broken sunvisor, 3 \\rblowers, many caliper problems.  It is \\rcomparable in quality to my 92 Taurus \\rbut for twice as much.  Without a \\rwarranty it is not a keeper.  Simply it \\ris a good looking problem machine. BUY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT!!! My third Audi A6.  They are the \\rgreatest.  Love the warranty, looks, \\rhandling.  What is not to like??  a previous BMW 5 series  now an A6 2.7T  I was a prevoius BMW 5 sries owner. \\rgranted BMW is a good Brand. however, \\rthe A6 2.7 Bi turbo is a much overal \\rcar. the car handles a lot better in \\rall weather. I owned the BMW for a long \\rtime I can honestly trll you that yes, \\ris a matter of opinion, but for me was \\rthe actual driving experience and Yes, \\rThe the A6 is better. \\r Shariff,M.D. great car great car Awesome Audi A6 i love this car for its design, looks \\rand comfortable and quiet ride.  I \\rlike the audi image of luxury without \\rpretentiousness.  the only thing that \\rshould change is that audi dealers \\rshould be required to strictly sell \\ronly audis not other cars. A6 2.7T The car is quick however not as agile  Audi 2.7 s-line I just traded my 3.0 A6 2003 for a new \\r2004 A6 2.7 s-line. I really liked my \\r3.0 but I love my 2.7 The acceleration \\rand handling is just outstanding. The \\rspoiler is just what was needed to \\rfinish the rear end. Too top it off, \\rthe quattro is awesome. By the way, \\rthe 9 spoke wheels are handsomely \\rcrafted. The braking is great. I would \\rhighly recommend the s-line to any car \\renthusiast. Second A6 2.7 T I was fortunate to have a certified  A6Q great ca, especially in snow #16 They just keep getting better!!! I\\'ve driven Audi\\'s since 1982 starting \\rwith a 4000 series. I turned in a 2001 \\rA-6 2.7Q. This \\'04 A-6 3.0Q is a tad \\rslower but the ride,quality and overall \\rvalue has gotten even better. You get a \\rlot more for the money than you could \\rwith a BMW,BENZ or Jag. Winter driving \\rhere in New England was a piece of cake \\rwith Quattro. Try one you\\'ll never \\rregret it. great fuel effecient , beutiful interior \\rdesign , fun to drive, made for long \\rcommutes. Audi A6 Review Short and sweet ... I have owned Audi \\rvehicles since 1977 and have found them \\rto be a very comfortable and reliable \\rfit for myself.  Have had one \"lemon\" \\rin all of these years, but obviously \\rthis hasn\\'t deterred me from continuing \\rto buy my favorite ... AUDI! Audi A6 4.2 with sports package With the sports package putting this \\rcar an inch closer to the ground, with \\rquattro power to all four tires, and \\rthe stability of the extra wide tires, \\rthis car is hard to beat.  This \\renables one to accelerate through \\rcorners and leave the two-wheel (front \\ror rear) powered cars in the dust.  \\rIt\\'s a blast to drive. disappointed Overall this is a fine car, however I \\rhave been extremely disappointed with \\rthe service department at audi. The \\rfeeling I got is that we are there for \\rthem, instead of them being here for \\rus. The wait time 55 minutes to hand \\rthem my keys was unacceptable. This is \\rmy 2nd 2.7t. The radio reception has \\rbeen a major let down. I receive \\rnothing but static on the strongest \\rsignals from the NY market Simply the best and getting better Why spend $15,000 more for the 540i?  \\rThe A6 2.7 Quattro is truly the \\rdriving enthusiast\\'s sport sedan. \\r Beamers are everywhere -- kids are \\rdriving them to school for Peet\\'s \\rsake.   The Quattro A6 will open the \\rdoor to a whole new driving experience \\rDon\\'t you owe it to yourself for all \\rthose years of hard work and dealing \\rwith life\\'s ups and downs. \\r Reward yourself like I did.  This is \\rthe car of the decade!! Two year report The car is a pleasure to drive. I am  Audi Repeat  Had 2001 A-6 quattro 2.8 with 54000 \\rmiles and liked the car very much.  \\rWhen I saw a new 2004 4.2 quattro at \\rthe dealer, I couldn\\'t turn down the \\rdeal.  It also had satellite radio \\rwhich I enjoy.  The car has plenty of \\rpower and the handling expected from \\ran upscale German car.  I have no \\rcomplaints and it is a blast to \\rdrive.  My only problem is keeping my \\r18 yr old son away from it.  \\r  I love my car I bought it and havent touched another  Winter driving This is by far the best car I have \\rdriven in tough winter conditions here \\rin Minnesota.  I have previously always \\rused SUV\\'s, but will never go back to \\rone again.  I also appreciate the XFM \\rradio standard in this vehicle.  The \\rheated car seats activate very quickly. Better Than Any Other I had an \\'98 A4 and loved it. Traded \\rfor a \\'00 Lexus GS300 4 mnths ago and \\rliked it, but had to go back to the \\rAudi. Drove the A6 2.7T and fell in \\rlove w/ it.  Audi makes the best cars \\r(great performance w/ luxury style). \\rBest car in the market under $80k.  You \\rhave power, performance, and tight (but \\rnot too tight) suspension. Happy and  driving  I had many friends who owned Audi\\'s in \\rthe past circa mid 80\\'s.  THey loved \\rthe performance and hated the \\rmaintainence problems.  I waited some \\rfifteen years. I love the car.  So \\rfar,  16,000 miles and counting I have \\rhad no appreciable problems.  The \\rregular service has been incredibly \\rgood, punctual, and reliable.  \\rActually, they have even been kind.  I \\rwould strongly recommend this car. A6 \\rand A6 allroad. BMW nut has been converted! The Audi A6 has a beautiful interior \\rand a very nice exterior, even though \\rit is in its \\rlast model year.  At first it did not \\rseem as fast as my 2000BMW540, but then \\rI looked in the rear view mirror and \\rrealized that it is ever bit as fast, \\rhowever the All Wheel Drive tends to \\rfool you a bit. With the front wheels \\rpulling while the rear wheels are \\rpushing you don\\'t get quite the \\rsensation of acceleration that you tend \\rto get in a rear wheel drive. Very \\rsmooth, very fast and great traction in \\rbad weather. THE NEW CLASS LEADER AFTER REVIEWING ALL OTHER MAKES & \\rMODELS IN THIS CLASS, BY FARE THIS IS \\rNOW THE INDUSTRY LEADER.THIS CAR HAS \\rBEST STYLING, PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY. \\rTHE BMW 5 SERIES WILL COST ABOUT \\r$20,000.00 MORE FOR THE SAME \\rAMENITIES, AND THE NEW TRUCK DESIGN \\rDOESN\\'T WORK.

Bad reliability, bad build quality This car handles well and slices through snow like a knife, all while looking surprisingly not too outdated, and has your expected luxury amenities like moonroof/Bose system/heated seats/power seats/ESC/AWD/good performance/elegant interior design, but it also has some surprising downsides, such as leather seats that crack and interior buttons/knobs that the black paint wears off of. Pretty disappointing for a luxury car but otherwise the interior is pretty well built. I would not recommend this car, at least from personal experience, because of its reliability issues. We bought our car second hand, granted, but it came with a fun oil consumption issue and heater did not work. Maybe ours was a lemon, but if you are buying one of these, watch out for this problem. Our old Buick has not exactly been babied and it still does not burn a drop, plus it is much older and has ironically run longer than the Audi. It looks like every other reviewer on here has had a good experience, but if you are buying one of these, buy one with a warranty or with its service history so you can tell whether the previous owner was meticulous in maintenance or not. If the previous owner didn\\'t treat it well it will not treat you well. Don\\'t take a chance and think \"The previous owner probably treated their car well.\" None Better! I\\'ve owned this car for about a year and a half now.I\\'ve owned over 40 VW\\'s and Audi\\'s and I\\'m am speechless about this car.Solid, smooth and as fast as the wind.I bought it for myself, but it quickly became my wife\\'s car.Outside of routine oil changes I\\'ve replaced the serpentine belt and tensioner, the driver\\'s lower aft control arm and the passengers side front drive axle.I did the work myself and it was fairly cheap.I do love this car. Take care of beauty I\\'ve driven this A6 for almost a month.Interior-wise, it is beautiful, comfortable.It had left engine mount broken and center engine mount broken off.One tube wasn\\'t even connected. great, just as unreliable as a range rover u all know it. its a great car. im only 17 years old so i like to blast out music with the bose sound system. its got decent gas mileage, great handling, does not shake on the highway unlike my other car with nearly 220k miles, my dad recently spent 2800 dollars for a checkup, the time belt and brakes keep having issues, but hey i love it. Even a girl at my school who got a hummer h3 for her 16th birthday says she really likes it. she just doesnt know about the nickels and dimes this car will cost u. thank god her mom has a lexus, she wont have to deal with the annoyances of a german car. still, if you dont like unreliable cars, NEVERR buy an audi German Engineering  I have owned this car for one year now and here is the list of issues that I have encounter so far. Coil packs were replaced due to a recall at 58k, Timing belts was done as a precaution at 60k, oil pan leak at 60k, cam seals were leaking at 62k, secondary water pump died at 63k, serpentine belt seized at 68k, front and rear break and rotor were replaced at 70k. And the upper bolt joint is on my to do list. So if you decide to purchase an Audi make sure that this has been done or you will be on a world of trouble. Don\\x92t get me wrong these are fun cars to drive. It\\x92s just to complicate to work on it, so labor can get really expense. Make sure that you find a good mechanic.  2003 A6 3.0 AWD This car has been a great car.  All that has been done to this car is the breaks, water pump, oil changes, and timing belt.  The interior is still silent despite the dirt roads and snow that this car as to travel everyday.  With the right tires this car would climb a tree, in the snow, if you wanted it to and where I live it almost has to on a daily bases.  May be a Mistake I just bought an Audi A6 2.7T 2003, and I think I made a mistake. After only having the vehicle for 2wks I need a torque converter, mass air flow, battery, and the tiptronic is failing; $3,275.00 to fix! and they say there may be more to do once the mechanics are in there. Kinda pricey to maintain but going to make it mine and fix it up like it\\'s a classic! fun fun to drive, especially in sport mode, had water leakage problem (battery holder overflow into passenger footwell ruining a $1700 transmission control cpu, catalytic converter failure, CV boots needed replacing, easily breakable cupholders; quattro goes through tires, not as reliable as a japanese sedan but way more fun to drive Well worth the cons.  I recently purchased a 2003 Audi A6 with the 2.7t.  I absolutely love the car and recommended buying one if you are in the market.  The big con that everyone looks at is reliability and cost of fixing. These are all legitimate concerns and if you cannot afford a brand of this caliber do not force it upon yourself. If you can, go for it.  It is smooth (engine and ride), fun to drive, and can easily be made into a sport sedan with a few simple tuning steps.  The room inside is fantastic and the way everything is put together simply makes you realize you are driving something that was truly engineered, not just threw together.  Overall I am 100% satisfied with the purchase of this car.   Nice to drive when you can Love this luxury car!  Then I find out that there are all sorts of water problems associated with these and most other VWs and Audis.  Of course this happens after warranty, not that the warranty would cover it any way.  What a horrible issue!  Thousands of dollars in repairs when all I needed when purchased was to be told about \"cleaning drains?\"  Have now read hundreds of people having same issues.  Why won\\'t they admit that German Engineering can have defects, too?  I guess that\\'s why the rich get richer.  Audi fans (which I was one of) claims they\\'re not even broken in until 100,000 miles!  You can\\'t get there!  I\\'m at 76,000 miles and the car is ruined.  Don\\'t let your Audi get rained on. Worst Car I\\'ve EVER Owned I purchased my 03 A6 3.0 certified pre-owned with just over 36k miles.  It has been without question the worst car I\\'ve ever owned.  3x stranded roadside and counting.  Numerous major repair items not covered by warranty. V-belt failed 15,000 miles before scheduled to be replaced, caused auto tensioner to seize and break ($2,500) not covered by warranty.  Motor mounts failed ($600) not covered.  Carbon deposits in throttle body cause SEVERE vibration. (proposed repair well over 2) Fake wood dashboard pieces have popped off and will not stay on.  I follow maintenance schedule to a T including $80 full synthetic oil changes, engine idles like an old pickup 2,500 miles into a 10k mile oil change. Leased Audi I purchased this from a dealer. It was a 3 year lease vehicle w/2 year warranty. It is by far the nicest vehicle I have owned & driven among 14 owned and more than I can count driven. It has good acceleration and reasonable handling. Quattro is great in the snow. Interior is first rate.  Some items not well thought out, like cup holders. I get just under 20 MPG. Overall it is fun to drive and I look forward to driving it. The reliability is poor. Like some others, I know the dealer\\'s service people on a first- name basis. The dealership has been great, but don\\'t want the inconvenience of visiting. I have had electrical problems; window problems; emission problems and wheel balance issues. Drives like a 4-door Porsche The Bi-Turbo and sports suspension makes this car a blast to drive.   Buyer Beware Based on the reputation of how the German cars drive I crossed the line from Japanese and bought this car.  It was the worst decision I ever made.  At 70K miles everything falls apart.  I have a huge oil spot on my garage floor from oil leaking, the airbag light stays on constantly because the device is defective (only $1,400 to replace it), then the transmission celanoid went out and cost me $1,800.  DO NOT BUY A USED AUDI.  I am sure these are great cars when they roll off the showroom floor because they are covered under warranty.  I WOULD NOT BUY AN AUDI UNLESS IT IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  These cars are fun to drive, but they are not reliable and cost a fortune to repair.   An honest review on Audi A6 3.0 Quattro I had this car for 6 months now.  I bought it with 48 K miles now I have 60 K.  I love the exterior of the car and the interior. After never having a car with AWD, I do not know how I lived without it.  I was scared to buy this car first because of electrical problems but so far so good. No problems with the car so far (knock on wood).  It feels solid and handles well.  Some little things that bothered me are when the annoying sound and display of low wind washer fluid, it\\'s half of the screen, some paint in the interior of the car chips off, gas mileage isn\\'t that great, doesn\\'t hold value. Goodbye Audi! Best day was when I got rid of my 2003 Audi A6 after owning if for 3 months.  Second day after I got it I was in the shop for an electrical issue.  In three months I had 2 other electrical issues but the real kicker is that fact that after sitting idle for a few hours the car has a \"warm up\" period before the car will drive.  Not to mention I get 12-15 MPG around town.   Gem of a car They weren\\'t kidding when they said, \"We have your car,\" in the ads.  I\\'ve never seen a car that adapted so perfectly to the driver.  Almost eerie... it took off like a shot when wanted, handled twisty mountain roads with ease, moved through snowfall when nothing else did. lemon law lawsuit My reliability experience with this car was terrible.  Nearly 40 days in the shop in the first 12 months I owned it, and practically every problem was related to electrical issues.  Audi\\'s willingness to resolve the problem was terrible, and the dealer was of no help.  I ultimately was forced to file suit under our state lemon laws.  After 9 months of legal process, I prevailed under the state law and was reimbursed accordingly.  My new Mercedes 4matic is far more comfortable and more reliable.  It drives just as sporty, if not better, and turns heads too. Audi A6 Wears tires out, perpetually out of balance, interior trim peeling, popping from the suspension, windows malfuntion in cold weather. In other words a piece of junk. Audi America says \"Too bad, we\\'ll keep fixing it the under warranty\". Tires have been balanced 6 times and replaced by Audi at 7000 mi., Audi says to rotate them every 3000 mi. Both front brake rotors replaced at 1500 mi. No problem for me, just took a loss on the Audi and ordered a 2006 BMW 530xi. No more VAG products for me! Sedan that Drives like a Sports Car The A6 is fun to drive.  I will sometimes take the \"long way home\" just to drive this car more.  Completely happy with the car and all of the features inside and out. Excellent This is by far the best car I have ever owned.  The quality and workmanship blows away Mercedes and BMW.  We only visit the dealership for scheduled service and car washes.   Sporty and responsive, but UNRELIABLE My final 2 test drives in 2002 came \\rdown to a choice between the BMW 530i \\rand the Audi A6 2.7T.  As most buyers \\rwho will read this review are already \\raware, every option on a new BMW is \"a \\rla carte\", and the price tag really \\rstarts to add up as you add options to \\rsupport its claim of being a \"luxury \\rperformance sedan\".  Because a \\rsimilarly configured Audi was about \\r$5,000 less and had very comparable \\rperformance, I went with the A6.\\r I now rue the day I made that \\rcompromise.\\r Although the driving performance has \\rlived up to expectations, the Audi\\'s \\rreliability has NOT.  After 6 trips to \\rthe shop (including 2 recalls) in only \\r24 months of my 39 month lease, I wish \\rI had gone with the BMW. So far so Good! Recently purchased a 2003, 2.7T A6.  \\rThe car is so much fun to drive.  Very \\rglad that I purchased this car rather \\rthan a BMW.  I can not wait for snow to \\rdrive in with the quattro wheel drive.  \\rWith the quattro, the fuel economy is \\rslightly less than I am used to as I \\rhave been getting about 20mpg wwith \\rmixed use driving.   Is there a shoe waiting to drop? I\\'ve had my A6 for less than a month \\rand keep thinking to myself: \"This car \\ris too good to be true\". Bought used, \\rthis was the dealer\\'s loaner car and \\rwas therefore low mileage (less than \\r11k) and in good shape.  I agree with \\rother comments that Audi has done a \\rgreat job differentiating their autos \\rfrom everything else on the road: great \\rdesign, but \"under the radar\" in terms \\rof flashiness and ostentation. POOR QUALITY I have had it back many times for a \\rloud bang when it shifts, passenger \\rheadlight fogs up, left headlight \\ryellow reflector fell off.  Audi \\rinsists it is normal except for the \\rreflector.  Passenger front wheel out \\rof line right after service.  I am \\rvery unhappy with the amount of money \\rspent and the return on investment. It \\rwas bought on reputation and the \\rparent company refuses to assist. ok traded a 528 for an a6cvt\\r 2003cvt a6 better: price, \\racceleration, \\rradio, trunk and rear seat room, value\\r 2000 528  better:  brakes, steering, \\rride stability, wind noise\\r If it wasn\\'t for that damn audi \\rtransmission (Hesitation and banging)\\rit would be better.  Otherwise pick \\rthe features you like best Balanced This car does it all: \\rperformance,comfort,styling,and price. \\rThrow in Audi\\'s workmanship with class-\\rleading fit and finish and you have \\rperfect balance.  Note: my driving \\rexperience significantly improved after \\rthe break in period. The engine, \\rshifter, and suspension seem more in \\rsync after a couple thousand miles.  Awesome Fun I love my car.  Anyone considering a \\rBMW, Jag, Acura or Lexus definately \\rneeds to step up in quality and \\rexperience an Audi for less money.  \\rThe quality of the interior in design \\rand materials in unparalleled in the \\rcar business.  The power of the 2.7 is \\rso much fun it\\'s scary.  I have driven \\reverything out there and nothing \\rcompares to Audi for the Money.  BMW \\ris the only one close.  Lexus is not \\reven in the same ballpark. Great car! So, far this is a great car. I drove a \\rbunch of BMW\\'s, A Jag, a Lexus, etc. \\rSome were fun (the BMW) some were soft \\rand slow (the Jag, the Lexus, for \\rexample) and most were far more \\rexpensive, for the same features! I am \\rvery pleassed, so far. Drives great! My A6 I\\'ve only had my A6 for 3 months, but \\rso far, so good.  It is very \\rcomfortable, rides very nice. Sporty, \\rbut wish I had gotten the 2.7L Turbo \\rfor more HP & torque. The \"Sport\" \\rtransmission & tiptronic help that a \\rbit. Passengers have commented on how \\rroomy the car is, more room inside than \\ryou would think. Classy interior, like \\rwith the wood-grain and leather. I\\'m \\ranxious to see how the Quattro handles \\rNebraska winters. Only glitch has been \\ra small electrical problem with the \\rremote door locks, but easily fixed.    wow!! THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST Almost Perfection This A6 is awesome.  Being a big guy \\rlegroom is great. Perfomance, power, \\rhandling, all great. Totally great \\rmachine so far. No road noise, large \\rtruck, and free maintenance for \\r50,000.  Can\\'t go wrong.   L GREAT!!! After 10 months and nearly 15,000 \\rmiles I am very satisfied with my \\roverall experience with The Audi \\rQuattro A6.  There have been a few \\rminor problems which were quickly \\rhandled by my dealer (great job - \\runder warranty) but these were quirkly \\rthings like a blinker switch, etc. , \\rnothing mechanical.  The performance \\ris great, the styling is great - clean \\rlines - and will never go out of \\rstyle.  Real wood trim and a fit and \\rfinish that is second to none will \\rkeep me happy for a long time. Audi Lemon Had car 1 month in shop for complete \\relectrical failure, windows, security \\rsystem, rear warning system, sunroof, \\retc.  Over the next 11 months, car was \\rin shop for same problem for a total \\rof 20 days out of service.  Local \\rdealer had no idea how to repair \\rproblem.  Audi corp refused to \\racknowledge our existence.  Finally \\rfound BBB Autoline arbitration. Met \\rwith arbitor and explained problem.  \\rAudi did not bother to show up for \\rmeeting, only faxed statement saying \\rdo not replace vehicle.  Arbitor found \\rin our favor and now awaiting Audi to \\rrepurchase vehicle so we can say \\rgoodbye to their product forever.  \\rBeware. Executive Rocketship I\\'m 6\\'5, so the first hoop to jump in \\rany car is height and legroom.  I could \\rwear a cowboy hat in my A6.  If I put \\rthe seat all the way rearward, I can\\'t \\rpush the clutch in far enough.  There\\'s \\rstill room in the back seat, too.  It \\rdrives like it\\'s on rails, and so fast \\rand quiet you really have to pay \\rattention or it\\'ll get away from you.  \\rOh, yes. A smoooooth ride, a luxury \\rfeel, and more performance than I\\'m \\rqualified to push. Awsome Car This car is everything you want and \\rmore.  once you get past the hot design \\rof the exterior, sitting in the front \\rseat is the best. the control panel is \\ra very hot and easy to use design. from \\rthe air conditioner to the fold in \\rmirrors this car was made for good \\rtimes.  the drive is great it is very \\rsmooth and its a pretty powerful car.  \\rthe best part is you can have your \\rfriends in the car because the back \\rseat and the truck are amazingly huge. \\rim 6-3 couldn\\'t fit in a bmw 3 series \\ror an a4 so i tried the a6 out.  i can \\rfit in the front seat and the back \\rwithout having to move the seat \\rsettings.  this car is all that and i \\rrecommend it to everyone!!!! WOW - This car is the big secret  This car is fun fast and beautiful.  \\rThe interior is so nice I feel like I \\rshould move into the back seat!  \\rPowering through turns with confidence \\rwith the quattro AWD is something that \\rthe BMW freaks cannot begin to \\runderstand (traded a BMW 535IS). \\rStopping power and cornering traction \\rare incredible. How does BMW gets the \\rhype from the media while ignoring the \\r2.7T 6 speed.  Those in the know will \\rtake this car hands down.  More room \\rthan a 330I or 530I , a world better \\rtraction, faster 0-60 time, nicer \\rinterior, solid warranty.   I have had \\rno problems except for two burned tail \\rbulbs.  We like this car: My wife \\rtraded her SUV for an Audi A-6 Avant.    Audi A6 2.7T quattro Excellent car.  Sporty yet luxurious.  Quick car! The engine in this car is awesome.   A Dream vs. 528i This is my first Audi, prior I had \\ra \\'98 BMW 528i and traded it in for the \\rA6 2.7T. Hands down the A6 is a more \\renjoyable car.  Steering is a \\rwonderful, and the power is un-\\rmatched.  As long as the car holds up, \\rI\\'m sold on Audi.  I really liked the \\rBMW, however now I can take this car to \\rthe mountains without a worry.  Love it. almost bought the 530i I came \"this close\" to buying the 530i, \\rbut the lease number was too high...so \\rI went and drove the audi just to make \\rme feel better about paying more for \\rthe 530....but once behind the wheel, I \\rfell in love with the car (a quatro \\r2.7T).  It has more and better \\rfeatures, is more comfortable, is \\rdefinitely faster and more responsive, \\rand is priced LOWER.  My lease price \\rwas nearly $100 less/month in the audi \\rthan in the 530.  I also like that the \\rbody style is new rather than \\rchanging.  It probably doesn\\'t have the \\rstatus of the BMW, but it\\'s close.  Go \\rdrive one, you\\'ll love it. great car My father just bought a 2003 Audi a6 \\r2.7 biturbo. the car is supurb to almos \\rany other vehicle in its class and \\rprice range. We got the premium version \\rwith On star, it has been very helpfuul \\rin times because there are time were \\ryour cellphone doesn\\'t have service and \\rOn star comes in handy. Also if there \\ris an emergency just click the utton \\rand help is on it way. What a ride!!!!!! The car is outstanding, the 2.7T engine \\rjust launges the car.  Along with the \\rability to travel MACH speed the car \\rprovides oustanding comfort and superb \\rroad handling with it quattro all wheel \\rdrive.  Wonderful car, I enjoy it more \\reveryday, would recomend it to anyone. audi a6 I had a Volvo S70 before I got my A6  Different The design, quality and feel of this \\rvehicle is excellent. They thought of \\ralmost everything. However, the seat is \\runcomfortable and no matter what I do, \\rI can\\'t seem to adjust it right. I have \\ralso noticed that the vehicle skids, \\rlunges forward when accelerating, esp \\rinto corners. Not sure why this is. I had a bad experience I hope this gets through to some \\rpeople, I have owned American cars most \\rof my life and have had no issues up to \\rnow.  I bought an Audi A6 in 2002 and \\rsince that time both the turbo and \\rtransmission have gone bad, I had \\rissues with my tachometer staying \\raccurate as well, anyone else have some \\rdefects like this?? Its just a hassle Best of both worlds A masterful blend of sport and luxury. \\rCapable handling without a punishing \\rride. More than adequate power, albeit \\rnot as muscular as some other \\rcomparable offerings. Comfortable \\rwithout the squishiness of domestic \\rofferings. Proper use of technology for \\rpurpose and not just gee-whiz gadgets. Sweet car! The 4.2 is taut,firm yet very \\rcomfortable.Tossable around town,smooth \\rand stable on highway.Got 4.2 sedan for \\rmy wife now I need to figure a way to \\rget RS6 for me. 2003 A6T missing features Just a note to thise considering the \\r2003 Audi A6T.\\rFirst , the multi function steering \\rwheel that let you control the audio \\rsystem is no longer offered on the \\rTurbo A6T anymore. I guess safety is no \\rlonger important to Audi when it comes \\rto driver distractions. I had this on \\rthe 2000 AT that I replaced and having \\rseen it in all the brochures expected \\rit in the 03 model.Quite disappointing. \\rIn addition, if you want a valet key \\rfor your luxury A6T you will have to \\rorder it for $65 and then take your car \\rback to get it programmed. No longer \\rstandard equipment. Nice way to \\raggravate your loyal customers Audi! \\r  Sexy Silver Arrow This model of the A6 will be \\rdiscontinued after 2004 and maybe the \\r2.7T engine as well. I\\'m sure the new \\rA6 will be great but the current one is \\ran ageless work of beautiful automotive \\rsculpture. For those who are not aware \\rof the care and attention to detail \\rAudi puts into its materials and \\rcraftmanship, you simply will not find \\rbetter at any price below six figures- \\rsee for yourself. . The 2.7T engine is \\ra jewel and provides intoxicating \\racceleration. I can only imagine what \\rthe RS6 with the 450hp biturbo V8 feels \\rlike.. Combine this excellent engine \\r(Ward\\'s 10 Best Engines 2000/01) with \\rthe Quattro and Sport suspension and \\ryou have an unbeatable package Worst car I ever loved... Every day I travel steep, twisty \\rmountain roads.  The first time I took \\rthe 2.7T (6M) up the mountain, I \\rcouldn\\'t believe how it clawed at the \\rhills and turns, wanting more throttle \\rthan I had the guts to give.  Even in \\rrain and snow, the A6 has never \\rblinked.  When it goes, it really \\rgoes, however, its seen more than its \\rfare share of time in the shop, 10+ \\rtimes for major and minor stuff.  :( Fast Twin Turbos I finally bought a AUDI 2.7T, it is a \\rgreat car for the money and otherwise \\ralso. Having driven MB E430 prior to \\rthis and a BMW and prosche. This car \\rhas a very good feel. Almost like 4 \\rdoor porsche boxter. Very Fast. There \\ris absolutely no turbo lag. But \\rdefinitely you have better road feel \\r(via the steering) in the 5 series and \\rthe porsche, but I think with the 235 \\r45 17 Tires and the sport suspension \\rthe road handling is as good and will \\rbe great in snow with the Quattro. All \\rin all it is a almost perfect car. delivery surprises I replaced my 2000 A6T with the same \\rspec\\'d car. Unfortunately I did not ask \\rabout the multi function steering wheel \\ras it shows in all the brochures. Audi \\rdoes not offer this  safety feature \\ranymore. Another surprise buyers will \\rhave is the \"no valet key supplied\" on \\rnew 2003 A6 cars. The sales person said \\rthey did not offer them but after \\rpressing Audi Corporate myself ,found \\rout I can buy one for $75 extra. I \\rguess these two items are Audi\\'s way of \\rsaying \" we are popular\" now so lets \\rsee how we can diminish how our \\rcustomers feel about us. Nice going \\rAudi, it sure turned me off. Audi A6 - good but could be better! I decided to buy Audi after reading \\rthe favorable reviews and some \\rpositive feedback from friends.  In \\rgeneral, this is a fine car but the \\rlack of attention to detail is a \\rproblem.  There are a number of \\rdistracting noises and rattles from \\rthe dash and air conditioning system. \\rWhile seated, the seat rubs against \\rthe middle console causing a very \\rannoying squeeking sound. With these \\rnoises ... I am glad the stereo is so \\rgood. Bought a second one.... I started with 2000 4.2 and upgraded to \\ra 2002 A6 4.2.\\rSilky-smooth V8 engine, plenty of \\rtorque... \\rInterior: The leather feels soft and \\rrich, the dash-board looks perfect, the \\rinstruments well placed, and the \\rthere\\'s plenty of room for 4 adults.\\rExterior:  Understated and elegant, \\ralmost a sleeper.\\rHandling is superb, rain or shine.  You \\rWILL need winter-tires, but that\\'s \\rstandard in this performance class.  \\rExcellent brakes, and four-wheel \\rtraction will make for fun in city \\rtraffic too.\\rIf you know cars and can appreciate \\rtechnology, buy an Audi and blend in -- \\rit\\'s a 50K car that feels like a 50K \\rcar should feel. A6 rocks!!! All cars should be be this roomy and  Great Car but be careful! The 2.7T is a fine automobile. The \\rissue I have is that this specific \\rmodel does NOT have the multi-function \\rsteering wheel. The brochure, web site \\rand quick reference guide that came \\rwith the vehicle all depict this \\rcapability. The fact is this \\rcapability / feature is not available \\ron a 2003 2.7T. My dealer did not \\rinform me of this. Needless to say I am \\rnot happy.\\r I have sent a letter to Audi of America \\rexpressing my displeasure and they have \\rnot responded. 2003 A6 3.0 CVT The CVT is nothing like I have ever \\rexperienced before. It is seamless and \\rsmooth like a true automatic \\rtransmission shoul be. Also, watch out \\rbecause you climb up in speed quicker \\rthan you might realize. The detail and \\rquality Audi puts into their cars is \\rone of the reasons I bought an Audi. \\rThe A6 is roomy and can still give you \\rthat sporty feeling. I love the styling \\rbecause it doesn\\'t look like other \\rcars. If you\\'ve noticed, all the cars \\rnow-a-day look the same. Get the Tiger: 2.7 Turbo! Beautiful lines and power. This car is a Well worth the money Best car I have ever owned for both  Smooth Riding I have only had the car about a week \\rand I can\\'t get enough of it! I have \\rfound more excuses to get me out of the \\rhouse and into the car then I care to \\radmit. The car is whisper quiet and the \\rride is extremely smooth. When you get \\rbehind the wheel and the red lights of \\rthe interior are a blazing, you \\rimmediately know you are in for \\rsomething special. The car accelerates \\reffortlessly and the handling is top \\rknotch. Our last vehicle was the Lexus \\rSUV and I expected differences in ride \\rquality...but not to this extreme. I am \\rvery pleased with our decision to go \\rwith the Audi. awesome car Its a \"smooth\" tough ride. you can \\ralmost feel the tires hugging the \\rroad.Everything about the car is \\rgreat . Well, the sunroof when is open \\rmakes a little draft noise Pure! I have never felt performance quite \\rlike this and I have owned many \\rcars.

If it is \\rdriven lightly then it is very well \\rmannered and handles the road \\rbeautifully and very smoothly. However, \\rif you begin to push harder the car \\rresponds like you wouldn\\'t believe. The \\rsteering tightens up, turbos begin to \\rpush, and it turns into a low flying \\rjet! This car simply rockets when asked \\rto do so! Perfect balance between \\rluxury and sport. Plus the Quattro is \\rawesome in bad wether. smooth as glass This is our second A6.  Our first was \\rdead reliable but was sluggish.  The \\rmore powerful engine with the CVT \\rtransmision is a vast improvement over \\rthe Tiptronic in our old A6.

But, I am having a \\rproblem that has turned my likes into \\rdislike.\\rFor the past 1500 miles, the brakes \\rhave been squealing terribly when \\rbraking. The dealer did an adjustment \\ron them which Audi recommends for this \\rproblem. All they did was scuff up the \\rpads and rotors with sandpaper. 30 \\rmiles later, and they were squealing \\ragain.\\rSpoke to Audi customer service, and \\rthey consider this acceptable due to \\rthe nature of semi-metallic brake pads. \\rThey said there is nothing else they \\rcan do if there is no physical problem.\\rSo I get to drive around a $50K car \\rthat sounds like a city garbage truck \\rwhen braking. \\r A6 2.7 turbo This is the second A6 that I have \\rpurchased, (the first being a \\'98 A6 \\r2.8 tiptronic).

The difference in the \\rpower and thrust in the 2.7t from the \\rprevious 2.8 is astounding: even faster \\rthan my 2001 TT roadster 225.  Having \\rthe available 6-speed manual has made \\rmy A6 ever so much more fun to drive.  \\rAs good as the Tiptronic was, it is \\rjust no match for a manual. AWESOME CAR Overall this is a grate car for its \\rmoney; I got a very good deal too. \\rLuxury and exclusivity is \\runsurpassable, performance could be \\rbetter but I don\\x92t expect much form a \\r3900lb car.  Sport suspension is a \\rjust perfect, but steering and brakes \\rare num. Lots of room and comfortable \\rseats. Safety is unbelievable, a \\rdomestic car side swiped me, my car \\rhad a little dent, but the other car \\rwas completely smashed I got a crystal \\rblue metallic, and for my knowledge \\rthere are only 3 in existence. Bose \\rsystem could be better, but this is \\rafter a $2,000 after market stereo. Audi A6 2.7T This Audi is far better than the BMW 5 \\rSeries.  It has a smoother ride, more \\rpowerful engine, and wonderfully \\rexicuted interior design.  The 2.7T is \\rpossible the best engine I have ever \\rdriven.  That\\'s a big statement because \\rI have driven a 530i, E320, Saab 9-5, \\rand its predisessor the 100 S. Great Car I bought the A6 with CVT. Audi is \\rcompletely right in that you don\\'t \\rfeel it shifting, but it still feels \\rlike an automatic, while getting \\rbetter gas mileage. The interiors are \\rjust incredible. I also own a Lexus RX-\\r300 and there is no comparison to it. \\rThe Audi is far better in quality of \\rmaterials, and I love the aviation-red \\rcontrols. Finally, the Bose system is \\rjust spectacular. My Audi Rocks! Test drove:\\rBMW 540 - interior was too small, \\rhandling was good but not good enough\\rMB E500 2003 - very nice, but $1000 gas \\rguzzler tax!\\rInfiniti M45 - interior too small even \\rfor a mussel car.\\rLexus 430 - nice but made me feel old \\r(bad idea)\\rPorche C2 - very nice but I am a famliy \\rman and in need of seats in the back \\rthat can carry something more than just \\rmy tennis racket & gear.\\r Finally, Test drove A6 4.2 Quatro.\\rWhen I made the right turn going 40 \\rwith no breaks and the car did not skit \\rand stuck to the road... That did it \\rfor me. rocket ship wounderful sedan. perfect interior.  Switched from a Benz Picked up the A6 2 weeks ago. The car is just \\rflat out fun to drive the Quattro is like glue \\ron wet and dry pavment.

Both cars,  50-55 MPH, were\\r\"totaled.\"\\rTwo occupants in the other car killed\\rinstantly.

The entire front was\\rdemolished with everthing in back of the\\rfirewall in as good as new condition. \\rThe front doors even open and closed as\\rif there had not been the collision. Lots of bang for lots of bucks When I went shopping for cars this \\rsummer, my wife was not enthusiastic.  \\rOur old car was fine.  It ran, didn\\'t \\rhave too many problems, what more could \\rwe want?  Then she test drove the Audi \\rA6.  She immediately fell in love with \\rit as much as I had.

I\\'ve \\rheard some people complain that Audis \\rcan be unreliable, but I haven\\'t had \\rany problems in the 6 months that I\\'ve \\rhad this car.  The only drawback is \\rthat the turbo sucks gas like it\\'s \\rgoing out of style.  It would also be \\rnice if Audi could design some real cup \\rholders.  Other than that, both my wife \\rand I LOVE this car. AUDI A6 This is a fun car to drive.  It handles \\rvery well, and seems very safe.  \\rEverything is within reach, and easy to \\rmanage.

I  For adults only My car is a 2001 A6 2.7 turbo, just \\rplain fun to drive. There is plenty of \\rroom for those teen of yours or just \\rhauling a pice of lumber, since the \\rback seats fold down. In the winter, \\rno fighting on who sits in the back \\rseat, since the back seats have seat \\rwarmers. It handles like a dream on \\rthose curvie back roads. My last car \\rwas a Lexus which was o.k., this car \\rhas far more bells and whistles then \\rmost $40k cars. The German quality is \\rcurtainly there. You won\\'t realize the \\rgood purchase you made until you have \\rowned this car for awhile. A6 4.2L is tight! I have owned Mercedes, a BMW and drove \\rseveral Porsches before deciding on \\rthis car and have never had a single \\rregret.  The styling is second to none \\rand the performance, especially in \\rsport mode, is tremendous.  I feel \\rlike I am in my old Cobra again.  The \\rengine even has a nice growl to it \\rlike it\\'s American counterparts. Best Mid-size Luxury Senan I purchased my A6 3 weeks ago, and I \\rLOVE this car!!! Exterior is simple yet \\rluxurious, interior top notch, and it \\rhas plenty of power. Its quality \\rmatches (if not exceeds) that of BMW or \\rMB, yet it costs thousands less. If you \\rare looking for a midsize luxury sedan, \\rmake sure you testdrive the A6. I\\'ve \\rheard of some reliability problems, but \\rso far so good :) Good for the first 50k miles... ... but a serious headache since then. In for over $7,000 in repairs since turning 4/50k. Would have been more if the dealer hadn\\'t taken pity on us. Literally in the shop to the tune of $1200+ every six months. And I\\'m not talking maintenance. That is expected. Conversely, my 2001 BMW just had its first non routine service (less than $2k btw). With just over 91k miles and at 7 years, the time has come to replace this vehicle. My advice if you must drive an Audi is to get yourself a nice 36-48 month lease and then toss it back to the dealer before the problems surface.  Tranny woes I love the styling, the power, the \\rhandling... but I hate the \\rtransmission! Would you ever shift into \\r5th at 25 mph? This car does.  It\\'s \\reither bogged down or revved up around \\rcorners - a little frightening. Love \\rthe trip-tronic, but hubby doesnt\\' \\rdo that. Ever.  You\\'d better have \\ra garage, cause this baby doesn\\'t like \\rNew England winters - it whines \\rand groans. And the wiper blades! \\rSummer-type only, Audi-brand only \\r($25), that can\\'t take any ice. The $90 \\rrubber floor mats let water leak onto \\rthe carpet... Gimme my old Volvo AWD! \\rOk, so I\\'ll miss the handling... LUXURY WITH STYLE Overall we are quite happy with the A6 \\rAvant. The car looks great, the \\rinterior is luxurious and somewhat \\rspacious. Very nice exterior design. \\rwe are so glad that we did not buy \\rML320.

I bought my 2.8 avant in 1999. In the first 36 months, it  worked fine. But only \\ra week after the warrenty expired, the water pump broken, and cost me \\r$1000 to fix. I had heard this kind of case before I bought the car, but I didn\\'t \\rpay much attention. Be careful, this car could cost you much more than you \\rexpected. Overrated Great idea, poor execution great car....if only In it\\'s first 20,000 miles the car has been flawless.  No rattles, squeaks or glitches.  The 200 hp V6 is peppier than expected but I wish they would make the wagon with a manual transmission, and ideally the 250 hp bi-turbo (but without the all-road lift kit) .  With 4 blizzaks the car is unstoppable in snow/ice. Incredible driving machine - will spoil you Bought this car in 2013 as a one-owner vehicle with 112K miles.  Needed timing belts and suspension bushings, but was otherwise perfect (not a door ding on a 11 year old car!).  Once the maintenance was done, the car has been basically trouble free for 3 years.  The only hiccup was a rodent chewing through a sensor wire that triggered the check engine light, not a problem with the car design or build quality.  The suspension bushings transformed the steering, adding precision and excellent response.  This is one of the finest driving cars I have ever owned.  In test driving potential replacement vehicles, I have repeatedly told salespeople that their new car does not drive as well as my 14 year old Audi (cars test driven included VW CC and Toyota Avalon).   At 80 mph, it is still quiet, rock solid, and very comfortable. I\\'m In love With this car This is the most amazing car I have ever owned!! Not only can does it look fantastic, but the power to go just as fast from 60 to 120 as i do from 0 to 60 is the most amazing performance ever!! I am the envy of all my friends, and have recieved neverending compliments of my car and its sleek sexy look and power!! I am in the process of getting a few things worked on for time service interval like my timing (wow expensive) water pump, and other maintenance, but have not ran into many problems!! I love the high style class listing of car I am in now, a 21 year old with an audi looks like i have rich parents, but my car is nicer than theirs, and I love when people think my parents bought it!! I\\'m the envy of all my friends My son who actually works for a Mercedes Benz dealer suggested that I look at the Audi Quattro\\'s. As a woman in her early 70\\'s has driven American cars all her life, I was impressed with the comfort and feeling of control the moment I got behind the steering wheel and went on the test drive. Years later I am happy to say this has been the best car I have ever owned. No extra trips to the shop between services and now with the new synthetic oil I take it in only once a year. I feel bad that I didn\\'t buy a car from my son but he agrees that I purchased the best car for my needs and the harsh winter weather in the Pacific Northwest.   It\\'s a great driver and fun to drive Bought new right after Christmas when the dealer gave us a wonderful price to make room for new vehicles. Paid $31,000 in 2003 with the CVT transmission. We really couldn\\'t afford the turbo 2.8 liter Quattro and lowered ourselves to a plain Jane A6. It was the best decision that was made. The wheels take the cheaper 16\" tires. (bought quality for high speed though) The CVT yields \\'me\\' around town abound 24 mpg and that\\'s nothing to sneeze at. I drive enthusiastic yet not foolish stops and starts. So far the dealer took care of the warranty and recall campaigns. We\\'ll find out soon enough for I found a great independent German mechanic that won\\'t rake me over the coals. Well worth the investment A superb luxury vehicle, even years later, which provides a nice, smooth ride. Fun factor is very high in this vehicle. With quattro, Florida downpours don\\'t slow your vehicle down a bit - only the other drivers do. This car\\'s handling and brakes have already prevented a rather horrible high-speed accident when a 2-ton truck decided to go from 80-20 about 12 feet in front of me. Good car so far Bought the car with 48,000 miles five years ago, now it has 142,000 happy miles and the car still drives like new. No major issues except CV boot replacement at 90,000 miles, Catalytic converter and O2 sensor replacement at 110,000 miles. With the high end technology comes expected high repair cost, having a knowledgeable and genuine mechanic will make your ownership worthwhile. Mark you if you need a simple sedan then this is not the car for you. Had fun passing SUVs stuck during this years record storm, thanks to the quatro AWD. 200,000 miles here comes my A6. Wow Wow what a car this car is great I lowered this car did intake and exhaust and it goes like heck jet chip is next look out for the Gray haired guy next to you at the light with the smoked out a6 Fun While It Lasted Loved the looks and performance of this car - both inside and out - but now shopping for a new car at only 90,000 miles.  Extremely disappointed that this car didn\\'t live up to the expected 200K miles.  As soon as the extended warranty was up, the problems started, multiplied and some unable to fix. Inept and outrageously expensive dealer repairs and other folks just don\\'t like working on Audis, will not take me down this path again - too bad for they have some beautiful new cars that I would love to own like the A5.  However, this experience has totally soured me on Audi and taking a new direction. Love my Audi 2.7T I have replaced CV boot, tie rod, brake pads and rotors, and expect to keep spending money on it. my friend is a good mechanic so he helps me out i just have to pay for parts.  but if you\\'re looking for an economy car, get a Honda/Nissan.  If you\\'re looking for something between Luxury and Sportscar, get an Audi.  its too heavy to be sporty but that makes it perfect for cruising and a little smoother ride.  its not as big as the A8...but is roomy enough to be considered a luxury car.   I would recommend this car ...to someone who thinks they might like Audi\\'s ...or who like VW.  Just do ur research and make sure you don\\'t find something thats been ragged on or wrecked.  :) I love this car! Bought it at 102000 miles. The body is in excellent condition. Huge trunk. Nice leather. Quiet ride. Great handling. Mileage is great for this class. Big 6 engine allows for awesome speed on the highway. I like the dash- and the the red lights are sweet at night. Acceleration is quick. I love the tiptronic feature-I use it on the highway and fuel mileage gets better. This is my first experience with an Audi and I am impressed. Wipers are quiet. Bose system is loud and booming. Two cigarette lighters- perfect for charging multiple phones/laptop use. I had already expected high maintenance costs (c\\'mon..it\\'s an Audi, not a Chevy). I replaced the air filter (w/K&N), timing belt and tires.  Good car  I bought this car new in 2002. I have only had a very things done to it (based on time) that were ahead of schedule. I just had the timing belt changed. It has been a good car and a joy to own. I intend to keep it another five years.  Review We have had nothing but problems since purchasing this vehicle.  The high repair costs have really turned me off on Audi.  CV Boots, some part in the transmission, motor bushings, and now they tell me that the transmission needs replacing. This is the last Audi that this family will own.   Won\\'t do it again This car is supposed to go 200,000 miles.  European luxury and engineering.  Less than 100,000 in I have had a plethora of minor problems (windows, trim, latches and brackets broken) and major issues (radiator rot/leak, trans slip, tie rod(s) failure).   Most disappointing is that Audi doesn\\'t seem to care -- happy to have a piece of junk riding the highways with their name on it.  To set the standard, Honda replaced my transmission at 145,000 miles due to known problem.  I\\'ll stick with the Japanese. Bad Choice Audi\\'s motto is \"Truth in Engineering\".  What a joke! Our Audi needed new brakes at 23K miles, and a new CVT at 45K miles.  Neither the dealer or Audi of NA would admit the deficient designs.  Audi never again. No compromise car It\\'s a no compromise car, it has power, control, style, comfort and safety. Purchased it 82,000 miles, only rode 1,500 miles with it so far but I never experience anything like it. A co-workers owns two A6 with the 2.8 engine, the oldest has 200k and the other is at 150K. Since I take care of my cars I feel confident that I may keep it for a while.  It give me about 24/25 MPG if I keep the speed under control which is okay for an AWD. Better than my Durango and slightly less than my Subaru H6 LL Bean. But these cars are not in the same league compare to the Audi. Poor quality in a pretty package Attractive design wrapped around a nightmare of ongoing expensive repair bills for items I have NEVER had break on any other car I have ever owned!  Keeping up with regular maintenance does not help avert the $1500 to $2000 bi-monthly repair bills that begin when the car hits around 75K miles.  This has convinced me to NEVER buy another Audi - good looks and style are not worth much when you frequently get stranded on the roadside with a dead car and have to face towing cost AND a couple of thousand dollars of repairs.  Not worth the premium I paid for poorly engineered mechanics :-( High tech sedan I use mainly for highway. I replaced air filter with K&N and new irridium plugs. I now get 26 to 28 mpg depending on whether I go 80 or 60 mph. I have had no problems and this car is built by the same people that make Porsche so everything is high performance, even the brake fluid. Thus more maintainance. It costs to go fast. I recently test drove a Mercedes S430 and as soon as I got back in my A6 4.2 it was far superior in road feel and handling. This is a double overhead cam V8 with 5 valves per cylinder. Ferrari is the only other car company with this sofistication. So if you want a mundane sedan this is not for you. This car is a race bred sedan down to the low profile tires. Still a great car.  Better than new This really is a great car.  I has power, AWD, style and comfort.  I have been looking to replace it recently with either an STS, G35, CTS and others, but I keep coming back to it.  It is roomy for a family, much more than the above cars and the materials are quality, though not as much as my old \\'94.  It is smooth, quiet and powerful.  It is not cheap like most Japanese or domestic cars.  If you buy these used with low miles they are an absolute steal.  The turbo is great for power and you can add a chip for more power if you want. One year of ownership I\\'ve owned this car for a year now and overall I am happy with the car. The A6 is a pure joy to drive.  It is very quiet at highway speeds, is comfortable for long trips, there\\'s lots of room in the back seat for adults, and the trunk is enormous. Parts and online forums are readily available for DIY work.  I\\'ve had one major problem: the transmission was repaired at 50,000.  It took Audi 2 months to fix the car which is just too long.  CV boots seem to be a regular repair item for Audi in general. I replaced one at 48k.  Other than those two repairs the car has been problem-free.  However, I recommend that if you buy an Audi then get one that is CPO or purchase an extended warranty. Check out your local dealer\\'s reputation as they can make or break your ownership experience. Impress yourself 2.7T with 6 speed  purchased certified used from Audi dealer. Our fourth Audi. Beautiful design inside and out and great build quality.  Can feel a bit clumsy around town, with firm suspension and too light steering. Once over 45 it is all good, very good. Really shows itself after a long day driving in bad weather. You simply feel safe, secure and confident and when you wish, this 4,000 car will really scoot along. A sweet engine. Full size people can fit front and rear in the great seats. We maintain by book and have had only routine maintenance at 108,000 miles. Average  about 25 MPG with 50% intersate driving. Nice Looking and Roomy, but Problematic! Purchased the car brand new in 2002.  Great looking car, and very roomy interior.  However, car is extremely sluggish off the start.  Acceleration can be jerky.  Power windows have been a problem for me.  My biggest pet peeve is the high maintenance/repair costs, as well as the frequency of repairs.  I have similar issues as others, such as the instrument panel has pixel fade.  Interior paint on climate control buttons have chipped. Good but not exactly solid Ok, I love my car... but is possible that the interior parts are so fragile? This is not what i would expect from a car at this pricepoint: The cigarette lighter doesn\\'t work anymore, the buttons on the climate control and the wheel on the light panel has lost the paint after a little bit of use, and the worst is the cup holders - broken them twice simply using them with soda cans! The last thing broken is the central unit (the one that is between the driver seat and the passenger seat), since the cover on  the top is broken, so I can\\'t open and close, not even replace since I should replace the entire central unit.  Love the Car - $$$ Maintenance Bill I purchased this car after test driving many other European options - BMW, Saab, Volvo (my wife owns one and likes it), and one Japanese option - Maxima.  Considering I have been a Honda, Nissan owner over the years, I was looking for something more exciting and I found it.  My A6 has been wonderful; fun to drive, nice to look at and a pleasure on road trips.  The CVT technology took some getting used to, but now I truly enjoy it.  Knowing the possible repair bills down the road, I purchased an extended warranty and it was not cheap.  Of course certain things are not covered, like replacing an automatic window clip for $450.  The 40K maintenance bill was $995 b/c of high precision eng/trans. Beauty of a Lemon My Audi is a beauty inside and out, but too bad it stops there. It has been nothing but a problem and has broken down (literally) FOUR times. First time they said I had carbon build up in all cylinders. Cleaning them cost $900 because it wasn\\'t covered by the warranty. They also flushed the fuel injection system for $300. Breakdown again. This time they said that it was an O-ring on the oxygen intake that wasn\\'t correctly tightened. Breakdown again. This time they changed the catalytic converter. Breakdown again. Who knows what it is. I\\'ve also had trouble with the warranty. My instrument panel has pixel fade, but they won\\'t replace it until all the pixels are gone! Don\\'t buy an Audi!! Go for it. I was looking for a pre-owned A4/BMW325/MercC230/LexIS300. The A6 4.2 Quattro wowed me. I have never driven such a smooth car before. Excellent power and handling. The styling is great. Have owned it for a month and it runs great with 52K miles. I am still discovering the features. I have yet not been able to test the Tiptronic system. Still figuring out how to make the telematics and Sirius work. I read each of the reviews on this site and agree with all the positive comments about the car.      2002 Audi A6 2.7T quattro AWD The A6 with twin-turbo and quattro is a thrill to drive - it offers spine-tingling acceleration throughout the gear and speed range and sticky, sure handling in all weather and road conditions - this is a four-door, all-wheel drive sports car with lots of room for driver and real adult passengers.   i LOOOOOOOVE my AUDI A6 The words can not express how much I enjoy this Car. I had purchased this car a year ago in 2005 and I just absolutely love it. It rides beautifully and it is such an awesome car to look at. All my friends love to ride in it as the rear seat has such luxurious space and comfort. Top notch German performance car I bought this car pre-owned.  I have had BMW 5 series before - great cars - but wanted to try AWD.  This car has interior room, solid quality build and great performance.  2.7 turbo engine w/ 6 speed and 40 to 120 mph doesn\\'t get any better. Superior handling but occasionally the sport suspension is harsh if you spend time on city streets.  In winter, mount 4 snows, turn off the ESP and you will put every car, truck or SUV to shame on snowy roads.  Remember to change the timing belt before 100k miles! Gets expensive after 70,000 miles I bought my 2002 pre-owned Audi in 2005. This is truly an awesome car inside and out. The features and performance can\\'t be beat in the same price range. However, you may be able to afford to buy an Audi, but you may not be able to afford to drive one. The transmission started slipping at 60K miles. Electrical problems (interior lights cutting on and off) were an issue, little noises and rattles (drive me nuts), the engine went to 300 degrees on normal summer days and finding someone to service the car was a task. Unless you live in a metropolitan area or down the street from the dealership, I\\'d suggest looking elsewhere. I traded it in after 12 months.  Vroom . . . gasp The ultimate luxury sleeper - one minute you\\'re quietly cruising a residential street looking very stately - next minute the bi-turbo takes a deep breath and this torquey little spacecraft catapults you effortlessly into the traffic flow on the interstate doing 90.  Very big trunk, roomy backseat and all the creature comforts - oh, and did I mention, all-wheel drive for those north country winters.  Would have liked a little bit better gas mileage, but still beats the last Dodge and Ford sixes I owned on fuel efficiency.  This is a very cushy rocket - don\\'t miss it.   Good, but... As a more affordable and more interesting design than the old 5 series, the a6 was my first choice, and the beautiful interior stil looks great, even without navigation. Although it\\'s extremely comfortable and has plenty of power for the average driver, I\\'ve had numerous problems, ranging from new window washers every year to an entire new transmission at 35k miles. The check engine and abs lights come on often, the stereo occasionally has a 30 minute meltdown, the rear windows stopped working...general deju vu for the classic audi-electrics sufferer. Handling on the non-quattro is also pretty sluggish...doesn\\'t feel tight in turns although the 2003 got far far better. Better than BMW A great German luxury car for those with the urge to be different.  I am guilty of owning boring BMW\\'s for much of my driving life but have found more style and comfort with Audi.  These 3 years have produced far more driving pleasure with routine maintenance absolutely no repair bills.  This car has truly unique styling that is not boring and conformist (or just plain ugly) like many BMW and Mercedes models.  We get lots of compliments on this car whether people are riding in it or just looking at it. Interstate Comfort and Safety The A6 is easy to drive and blast through the Sierra Nevada interstate system.  As I let my 16 year old drive from Vegas to San Diego, it is a joy to let him learn to \"operate\" this vehicle.  I feel confidence in Audi, and am looking at the new A4 2.0T for my next trip to the dealership.  The CVT now feels \"right\" with my stop and go driving in town... but took getting used to. The MPG has been 22-26 without really trying.  I am now a convert of the teutonic quality build of this A6, and will recommend it to all my best friends.  I have had no problems with this car.    Black beauty The car is simply beautiful. But which Audi isn\\'t? Even with the new A6 out on the market the 2002 still looks very stylish. I bought it for my wife who is switching from a 323i (We bought the BMW new and had a mass of problems, turned out to be a dissapointment). The A6 is very comfortable and the CVT shifter is smooth. It\\'s got enough umph to beat most like cars at the light but I did not buy it to race. I wanted a stylish touring sedan with plenty of space, comfort, power, and for great (European) heritage. Since we bought it the engine oil level sensor has been replaced in it by the dealer.  Audi A6 I have read some Bulletin Board comments regarding some reliability problems with the Audi A6.  My experience has been completely opposite.  It is the most reliable and well-built car I have owned.  My last car was an Acura TL, also a very reliable car, but the Audi came out ahead on almost every detail.  Bought it new in 2002 and after 42,000 miles have never had a single problem. This car is the worst I\\'ve ever owned The car is always in the shop.  The \"Check Engine\" light goes off every 6 weeks.  I would NEVER buy another Audi again.  if you think of buying one, DON\"T!!!!  Get a Lexus instead!!!! Feels great My 2002 Audi A6 2.7T is really fun to drive. The touch shifting is great in the mountains and a adds a great deal to safety in slowing and cornering capability. The car is very quick between 40 and 80 MPH and handles very smoothly. I have the Winter package which adds tremendous comfort on the cold days. The Bose sound system is awesome! 2002 Audi A6 3.0 Fwd Sedan I enjoy this car because it drives smoothly, has a powerful engine,\\r(for a 6-cilinder), has an excellent Interior.  I have not experienced any \\rmechanical problems yet.  My A6 has a high level of comfort for \\rthe driver and passengers. \\r My A6 A Fun car to drive, esspecially in the \\rsport mode. But the fuel economy in the \\rcity is very poor. Audi on the move My 2.7t A6 manual transmission is a \\rgreat car. If you have the need for \\rspeed and crave the excellence of a \\rgerman car this is for you. Benz, BMW \\rand the likes better keep there \\rengineers on the ball because Audi is \\rcoming to kick you to the curb. I would \\rbuy another Audi. this is already my \\r2nd Audi. Belly up to the line and let \\rrock! Good! Good! Good! Great car, comportable, easy to ride, \\rgood on long trips. Buyer Beware Problems from day one on this A6.  Had \\rto get the tranmission control \\rreprogrammed because excelleration was \\rnon-existant in Drive mode (Sport & \\rTipTronic was fine.) Two weeks w/o \\rcar.  Have had brakes/rotors adjusted \\ror replaced 4 times (only 17K on it to \\rdate) and it still sounds like a \\rschool bus when I come to a stop.  \\rAudi says that is normal - right!  Now \\rI need to get some red flashers and \\rpaint it yellow.  Power Steering fluid \\rleaked out almost totally, window \\rmotors had to be replaced, tires \\rvibrated constantly on highway, and it \\rgoes on.  If this was a 9K car, maybe \\rI could understand it, but it\\'s a 42K \\rcar - No Excuse.  I miss my ES-300. Great Driving Car I have my 2002 A6 2.7T for 18 months \\rnow, and have loved every minute of \\rit.  There has been some concerns \\rnotes elsewhere about Audi \\rreliability, so far the only trouble I \\rhave had was a bad windshield wiper \\r(fixed for $0 of course).  It is fun \\rto drive, handles great (even in snow) \\rand has a fantastic interior (looks \\rgreat in the dark). Extremely Poor Quality and Service My car has only 14,800 miles and has \\rbeen in for repairs 4 times due to a \\rvariety of reasons- catl conv (twice), \\rignition coils, and stereo system going \\rout completely.  Unfortunately, the \\rservice departments and Audi policies \\rare NOT what you would expect of a \\rluxury car dealer.  Our other family \\rcar is a Lexus (similar class, type) \\rand we have received excellent service \\rfrom the service dept, always gotten a \\rLexus loaner, and never been brought in \\rfor repairs.  I bought an Audi \\rexpecting a high level of quality and \\rservice and unfortunately have not come \\rclose to my expectations.   2002 A6 2.7 T My second Audi.  Love it in the snowy \\rNortheast Winters.  Handles great, \\rwith superior pickup in all conditions.\\r Fun, while safe, to drive.\\r FUN CAR THIS CAR HANDLES GREAT. A VERY SMOOTH \\rRIDE AND A GREAT AMOUNT OF POWER. THE \\rUPPER LEVEL A6\\'S ARE ONLY ABOUT A 1/2 \\rSEC. FASTER 0-60. LOVE THE CVT \\rTRANSMISSION WHEN IT IS USED RIGHT AND \\rINTERESTING AT OTHER TIMES. ALREADY \\rHAD TO BEREPLACED AT 10000K,LUCKILY \\rUNDER WARRANTY.NOISEY SUNROOF WHEN \\rCLOSED ALL YEAR ROUND. OTHERWISE GREAT \\rCAR. Pathetic Reliability Great car if you want to know your \\rservice dealer really well as car is in \\rshop over 35 days/15 months for a \\rvariety of mechanical problems, some of \\rwhich can not be fixed even after 5 \\rattempts. no contest! I\\'ve been an audi fanatic for over 10 \\ryears now, and my love for the cars \\rstill holds strong. The 2.7T engine is \\runbelievable for crusing, and for \\rthose red light launches. The xenons \\rare great, visibility is unmatched, \\rThe bose is crisp, heated rear seats \\rare just cool, and the engine is to \\rdie for. This is my 5th Audi in 10 \\ryears and they get better everytime!!!! 4.2 quattro..the way to go Maybe favorite car ever...I\\'ve \\rowned \\'em all.  Great \\rexcelleration...comfort, every \\roption...just wonderful car Great car -- for the money This is a really great car.  It\\'s a \\rhoot to drive, it\\'s fast, it looks hot, \\rthe quality is top-notch.  It\\'s worth \\ranother $10k (but Audi\\'s reputation \\rcan\\'t support it) -- and it beats \\reverything else in its class.  And keep \\rin mind, I\\'ve owned BMWs, Porsches, and \\rM-Bs.\\rThe Quattro is smooth.  The turbos \\rscream.  I\\'ve got the Sport Package -- \\rand I\\'m glad I do.  Steering is a \\rlittle vague; not enough road feel.  \\rAnd...watch out for the front bumper.  \\rIt\\'s very low (for a sedan).  You don\\'t \\rwant to hook it on a parking stop. Audi A6 a bad experience I have owned the car for 42 days and \\rit has been at the dealership with \\rfive problems for 21 days of the 42 \\rdays I have owned it. The malfunction \\rlight came on twice (catalytic conv. & \\rpurge valve), windshield fluid \\rcanister, unable to turn key even \\rafter forcing wheel, alarm goes off \\rrandomly, they have no idea why!! What a car! Wow! I was looking for something \\rsporty and comfortable that could \\rhandle the miserable inland NW snow and \\rice. This baby\\'s the ticket! \\rUnbelievable power and great braking. \\rExtremely efficient cliamte control and \\rgreat heated seats. Handles like a \\rcharm no matter how bad the roads are. \\rAudi has come a long way from the old \\rgarage crashers and \\rthis car is the proof (I still hear the \\rjokes though.) \\r Acceleration is a little herky jerky \\r(but once the turbo\\'s kick in, hang \\ron!) The brakes are a little grabby \\rtoo, but you get used to it. VERY Satisfied I now have 9800 miles on my 2002 A6 4.2.\\r It has performed flawlessly, and is as\\rmuch fun to drive as the three Porsches\\rI\\'ve owned (in 70\\'s and mid 80\\'s).  It\\'s\\rfast; quiet; beautifully designed\\rinterior; interesting, German-type\\rtechnical features (loaded with them!)\\rand, in the mountains the Quattro is\\rinvaluable.  I\\'m running Dunlop Winter\\rSport M2s for Winter (Tire Rack\\rpurchase; they stick like glue, in\\rBoulder snowstorms and on ski trips,\\reven on ice!) and the provided 185/40/17\\rContis which were stock, and came with\\rthe car.  Not a rattle in 10K miles.\\rDealer service impeccable. \\rI\\'d buy another one.. I love it! Perfect! I owned Benz E320, BMW528 but I\\'ve \\rnever met like A6 2.7T AWD.\\rI love its everything. You must be \\rhappy with it. I guarantee it! A6 3.0 is good to go The 3.0 isn\\'t the fastest, but \\rdefinetly an excellent package for the \\rmoney.  It has good power and handles \\rvery well.  It\\'s heavy enough to give a \\rsmooth ride.  It\\'s large enough to for \\rthree child seats, which isn\\'t the \\rnorm, but has happened.  It comes well \\requiped and is a definite eye catcher \\rwith a sexy set of chrome wheels and \\rmedium profile performance tires. Timeless Audi Great car overall.  Love the 3.0 engine  Best Ever This is a fabulous car.  Luxurious, \\rcomfortable, powerful, stylish, and \\rvery very responsive.  It handles like \\ra sports car but with the comfort of a \\rluxury sedan.  Very little lean on \\rtwisty roads, great acceleration.  \\rGreat fun to drive.  Best of all, in \\rover 10K miles, zero defects noted -- \\rnothing, nichts, nada. My 2002 4.2 Previously owned 2000 2.7 T.  Crashed \\rit into a tree and bought the 2002 4.2 \\rnew at the begi9nning of 2003.\\rSmooth power, excellent handling. \\rInterior first class.  Tiptronic on \\rsteering wheel is nice little \\rgimmick.MPG seems to be about 18.0, but \\rwife driving mostly in town.\\rIn a word, the car is solid, solid, \\rsolid. 2003 A6 3.0 Quattro I am coming out of a Toyota Avalon and \\rhave never owned a European sports \\rsedan.  Looked at Infiniti G35, Acura, \\rVolkswagon,and Lexus. Wanted something \\rmore conservative and low key than a \\rBMW. Only have owned for 30 days but so \\rfar so good.  Dealership worked very \\rhard to earn my business and was much \\rmore aggressive on price than I \\rexpected.  Considered 2.7T model, but \\rprefered the steering wheel radio \\rcontrols in the 3.0 Quattro. You need one of these I looked at the BMW 530 to compare, \\rprobably the only truly comparable \\rcar, and was not impressed.  A6 beat \\rit in styling, luxury and overall \\rcomfort (5 series has almost no rear \\rleg room).  With the quattro,sport \\rpackage and 17 inch wheels, this thing \\ris stuck to the road like a roller \\rcoaster (the dealer had me take a \\rright turn at about 40 mph, not even a \\rskid).  A true sports sedan that \\rscreams \"class.\" Great car Handles great - would buy an A6 again Best of both worlds Love it! I have a family of four and \\rwas tired of the SUV/Minivan thing and \\rwanted something fun to drive.  We \\rstill have the minivan, but this car is \\rthe quintessential sports sedan.  Great \\rfor family outings or date night with \\rmy wife or a solo drive on a winding \\rmountain road blaring the Bose system. Second Audi First Audi was a 98 A4 2.8 6 speed \\rsport. This A6 also brings a smile to \\rmy face when I get behind the wheel.  \\rIt isn\\'t the fastest or the sportiest \\rof the A6 line, it is simply a pleasure \\rto drive.  Was reluctant to give up \\rshifting gears, however the CVT is a \\rvast improvment over an automatic.  No  \\rslop, no lag, no power loss. If you \\rmiss shifting, slip it into tip mode \\rand blip thru six forward ratios. \\rHandling is good even without sport \\rsuspension.  Great interior.  No \\rregrets. This is the only Bavarian Have 58,000 miles on my 2000 A6 4.2. \\rAbsoutely wonderful car. Wonderful \\rinterior, beautiful lines that still \\rget looks. And gets the last word in \\rmost roadway encounters. Think so \\rhighly of this car that I bought the \\rextended warranty at 45,000 miles. \\rThought about something different for a \\rwhile: The problem is, after test \\rdriving the new E-500, the 5 and the \\rnew 7-series, I just dont know what all \\rthe fuss is about. Looks like I will be \\rbuying another A6. A fantastic autombile A great value - far better than the \\routdated 5-series, both of which I \\rtest-drove. Disappointed Poor build quality - recalled twice.   What a great car Who would have thought 15 years ago \\rthat Audi would emerge as such an \\rincredible auto maker.  Everything from \\rthe elegant and understated design to \\rthe incredibly refined and impressive \\rinterior give this car an industry-\\rleading beauty.  Add the performance of \\rthe biturbo engine and sport suspension \\r(along with the after-market addition \\rof 18\" wheels) and you have a stealthy \\rperformer with comfort for business. A \\rfantastic car.\\r Roland\\'s 2002 Audi A6 It is without question the finest  No Buyer\\'s Remorse Here What a great vehicle! Everything \\rincluding the style, ride, interior \\rdesign, and comfort is fantastic!! If \\rthe 530I is a nine then the A6 is a 10. \\rAudi pays more attention to the little \\rdetails. The Audi staff at Boardwalk \\rwere great to deal with unlike the \\rsnotty impression given by the BMW \\rsales guy. Why buy Benz? Perfect Audi!     Whoa, 2.7 liter V6 with bahaus \\rdesigned twin turbo system. Can life \\rget any sweeter? The interior is \\rbeyond beautiful, a PERFECT dash \\rdesign. First class exterior. Plus \\rtwin turbos that BLAST you into the \\rback seat! Not a single problem yet \\rand I\\'m at 13,600 miles. I love this \\rcar and I\\'m in no hurry to get a new \\rcar and I\\'ve been spoiled by the best \\rbrands my other cars have been a 2000 \\rInfiniti Q45, and a 2001 Lexus RX 300. \\rI\\'ve never owned a better car and I \\rnever never will! Try to catch me Benz. so far so good Well its been a month since i purchased \\rmy A6.  I have been a frequent bmw \\rdriver for 4 years but receieved poor \\rcustomer service from bmw.  So i \\rdecided to buy an A6.  I was warned by \\rconsumers that there were reliability \\rproblems.  So far so good! People \\rusually buy car for looks and handling \\rand the A6 has both.  It is a lease so \\rim not worried when it comes off \\rwarranty, because its not my problem \\ranymore.  Also,  I have leased all my \\rprevious bmw and nothing beats \\raudi/vw\\'s leasing program!  Way to go \\rAudi!!!\\r Kurt  San Diego  CA Great car w/couple of nitpicks I bought this car a few weeks in a \\rmingblau, colors are sharp, interior \\rmaterials are really high class, great \\rpower this machine is like a rocket! So \\rfar, no problems whatsoever, and gets \\rplenty of car envy looks from people. Booming A6 2,7 Biturbo 250 HP Quattro Tiptronic \\rreally rules, especially on the tight \\rmountain curves, where no M5 or AMG or \\rthe horrible SUV\\'s can keep up!\\r Great Car After a 4 month wait (factory order), \\rI finally got my A6 and it is worth \\rthe wait.  The acceleration of this \\rvehicle is very good.  You can feel it \\roff the block and at high speeds.  The \\rsports package is an excellent \\roption.  I have not put the Quattro \\rall-wheel drive to test yet.  The fuel \\rmilage is very bad.  My average is \\ronly about 16 mi/ga., probably because \\rof my short city drive from home to \\rwork. It\\'s Good But It Could Be Great!! The A6 is a great looking and great \\rdriving car but the small problems that \\rarise detract from the car\\'s appeal.  \\rOn day one the window motors were a \\rproblem and they have been a problem \\rfor the past 35 months.  Add to this \\rheated seats that don\\'t always heat and \\ra heated steering wheel that never \\rheated (it took the dealer 12 months \\rto \"resolve\" the problem and it was \\rnever really fixed).  Lastly, dashboard \\rindicators go dark periodically.  Do \\ryou think they have an electrical issue \\rto resolve at Audi? 2001 Excellent Quality and interior design.\\rGood handling automobile. \\rHorsepower is weak, needs more power \\rfrom 0 to 60. Why buy Mercedes? This car is great!! Leased this car . \\rBlack on black sport, premium, \\rluxury, convience pkgs.  For 46,800 \\ryou get the same space, \\rperformance, build quality,trim etc., \\ras the mercedes E430 4matic for \\r15,000 less!  Acceleration is strong \\rwith minimal turbo lag.  Exterior \\rdesign is aging, but very gracefully.  \\rThe best bang for your buck midsize \\rluxury car in my opinion.  I am very \\rpleased with this car.  The salesman \\rwas also first rate, straightforward \\rand no B.S.  Very customer \\rorientated. Best Value in Market I bought a loaded 3.0 CVT after \\rshopping against the BMW 530i.  With \\rthe same identical options, the Audi \\rwas $12,000 cheaper out the door while \\rhaving more interior and cargo room \\rthan the BMW.  Quality and reliability \\rhas been first rate.  The CVT is a \\rbreakthrough technology for this size \\rof car.  The interior is the best in \\rthe industry.  The A6 is simply the \\rbest value buy in the luxury car \\rsegment. Very Happy! To put my rating in perspective, I came \\rout of 3 yrs in a BMW 535, and 3 yrs in \\ra 540. This car is a very pleasant \\rsurprise. Very nice response from the \\rtwin turbo-kicked engine. Optional \\rsport package suspension w/ 17\" wheels \\rand Dunlop 9090\\'s provides excellent \\rroad handling in the twisties. Looking \\rforward to the Quattro here in \\rMinnesota. If the BMW\\'s \\rwere \"10/10ths\", this 2.7T is \\r8.5/10ths, and for the money, I\\'ll take \\rit. No title I love this car.  I actually purchased \\rthe 2000 model, but they didn\\'t have \\ranywhere for me to sound off, so I\\'m \\rdoing it here.  I recently had to \\rdecide whether or not to trade in my A6 \\rfor a BMW 530 and I actually started to \\rcry at the thought of giving up my \\rcar.  Needless to say, my A6 is still \\rsafely parked in my driveway. rocket ok its ten grand more then the 2.7 t \\rbut iam 6ft4 and i needed the extra \\rinches. plus the a8 seats. and the v8 \\ris near perfect, except for the poor \\rmisleading gas millage. i live in los \\rangeles, home of the bmw and merc.  \\rthere everywhere.  i choose the audi \\rbecause its hip without being \\rpretentious and the craftmenship of the \\rinterior is flawless. Terrific first few months Bought the car in 2/02, easy to finace \\rthru Audi, absolutely no reason to bring\\rin afterward. A terrific first \\rexperience for my first Audi. (I\\'m a \\rdefrocked BMW owner.) audi a6 I looked for months before deciding in  Easy Car To Like After purchasing a 2002 allroad in \\rDecember I quickly became a strong \\radmirer of the great interior and good \\rengine performance of the 2.7T.  My \\rprevious Audis\\' had quattro so I \\ralready knew the advantage of that \\rdrive sytem.  \\r The A6 2.7T is a fine automobile with \\rvery pleasant performance \\rcharacteristics, handsome interior \\rmaterials and an overall package that \\ris purposeful and sophisticated. A6 2.7T Review This is my third Audi in five years.  \\rI\\'ve owned an A4, S4 (great car) and \\rnow the A6 2.7T.  This is a great exec \\rcar with plenty of room for people in \\rthe back, yet sporty enough to have \\rfun. Wonderful Blend of Performance and Lux. The 2.7 Turbo is amazing; with strong \\rboost coming from way down in the rpm. \\rIt is so smooth that I had to \\rconstantly look down at the speedometer \\rto prevent speeding tickets.  The only \\rcomplaints I have about the engine is \\rthat the sound is a bit mute and \\rlacking a bit of excitement for me \\rwhile some other might consider it \\rrefined.  The throttle respond is also \\ra bit strange.  \\rIt\\'s nice to have 6 gears with sporty \\rhandling in a car as large as this.  I \\rregret not ordering it without the \\rinexpensive sport package which include \\rsport seats, wheels, steering wheels, \\rand suspension.  The standard leather \\rseats are too wide so I tend to slide \\raround during corning. Beauty in Motion I stayed up nights deciding on this \\rcar, then waiting for it to come in.  \\rI\\'ve had it for just over a year now \\rand still enjoy taking the long way \\rhome.  I love it when it rains and I \\rget to see what quattro can do.  The \\rinterior is utterly gorgeous, \\rintegration between the Nav system, \\rbuilt-in phone and awesome stereo \\rsystem is flawless.  Oh, and don\\'t let \\rthe weather get cool...performance goes \\rto another level. Almost perfect.... Excellent value, smooth ride and well \\rappointed interior. Luxurious in an \\runderstated way. A6 2.7T Purchased to replace large SUV.  Have  This is the one Lokked at Bm\\'rs, lexus and infinity. Nothing came close in ride, handling and power. This is the big boy\\'s toy. 30 Something Family Man After looking at all the competition in this market I chose this car because of its Style, Performance, Safety and Utility.\\r Style- Love the look outside and the interior.\\rPerformance- 250 HP Auto with Tip. Very intertaining\\rSafety-All the right airbags, Traction control, and AWD.\\rUtility- 4dr, 4 adult fit well and a large trunk.\\r I love driving this car.  It is not too big or too small.  I can take 3 other adults in the car and know that they will all be very comfortable.\\r The performace of the twin turbo is good. I have never \"needed\" more that it delivers.  However I would not turn down more power. Second A6 in Three Years The A6 is an understated, fun car to drive.  I like the body styling because it is clean and not ostentatious, like a BMW or Mercedes.  The interior is well appointed and meets my needs.  The drive is smoothe and the handling is very good.\\r I have had very good results from my 1999 A6 (Same Body Style).  That car had 75,000 miles on it.  The ride has always been smoothe.  Minor discrepancies were electrical problems with the power windows and an earlier fuel gauge problem.  However, the dealership was great and took care of the problem immediately.\\r The 2002 model is similar, but has a larger engine.  The features I like are the 6 CD changer that is located in the dash. Audi 2.7T Quattro. Excellent car.  For power perfromance price and package not other model can come close. AUDI 5000? THIS CAR HAS COME A LONG WAYS FROM THE OLD SELF STARTER 5000\\'S. LOVE THIS CAR. JUST TRADED MY 2000 528 FOR THIS WINNER. HAPPY WITH THE OVERALL PRICE/VALUE COMPARED TO THE BAVARIAN MINT. THE 2.7T IS MUCH FASTER THAN I THOUGHT AND THE COMFORT LEVEL OF RIDE IS ON PAR WITH MY WIFE\\'S LEXUS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT 3 YEARS! Audi A^ The Audi A6 did not meet my expectations.  Instead, I prefer a Mercedes-Benz C-Class.  The C-Class is far superior in design,  performance and price. Perfect Car We have had the car for about 6 months and it is a perfect family wagon. It has plenty of room for a family of four and a dog. It gets about 25 mpg in mixed driving and 29 on a recent highway trip. I have been a Japanese car fan for the last 10 years after several BMWs left me wanting something with less maint. down time. I saw that the Audi reliability ratings were getting to a point that I felt comfortable giving an Audi a try. It\\'s only been 6 months, but so far not one problem. We also live in New England and wanted all wheel drive, but we didn\\'t want a truck. It was great in the snow and handles like a sports car on the dry pavement. Awesome Audi!!! This car delivers on all counts!!! It\\'s pricey but worth every dollar! Great car with few issues Great muscle car with luxury. Still a great car at 105K Update to my earlier review.  Now I have over 105k miles on this car that I purchased new.  It goes through brakes but it has otherwise been faultless.  Still love driving it.  Same great ride, no rattles and no issues.  Recently had to add some coolant, but other than that, just routine oil changes. 100K and going strong This is the third review from me on this car.  Just turned over 100,000 miles without any significant issues.  I am the original owner and just follow routine maintenance.  It is still solid, quiet and a great performer.  This is the best car that I have owned.  Looking to keep it at least 10 years. Strong and very Reliable car Second A6, got it CPO with 35k back in jan/2011 , now 105k with no mayor repairs.\\rI do regular oil change(Castrol synthetic)  and all recommended maintenance..For my brakes ,fluids, filters and battery only use OEM parts\\rOnly repairs I came across are light bulb change and throttle body clean up . \\r Yes repairs and maintenance can be expensive but it is a $50\\'000.00 car with a great look and performance. My cost to own very low until now ,and planning to keep it for years to come. Almost in love.... The car is a beautiful style and handsome even 4 years after its birth. Interior is top notch and I even prefer it to the 2012 loaner A6 I am driving this week.Fuel economy is outstanding and the car just glides at 90mph.However, the CVT transmission is quirky and I would opt for the Quattro next time around.Car is sluggish off the mark and much of that is around the CVT. I had it in twice this year for rough idle and jerky driving when cold. Also, Audi refuses to update their software in a timely manner for the Media Center and is behind the curve of technology despite what the commercials tell you. Remote doesn\\'t roll down windows and no streaming music from your phone to Bluetooth. 58k miles and still GREAT This is an update to an earlier review.I now have 58k miles in this car and it is still one of the best cars that I have owned.To date I have had minor failures (tail light, head light) but nothing worse!I still get about 27-28 mpg highway at 75 cruise.It is quiet, solid as a bank vault and drives like new.This car is not about cutting edge performance and handling.It is about quality of construction and easy highway driving.I still look forward to driving it each time.I would highly recommend this car to anyone. Frustrating This is my first experience wiuth Audi after owning Volvos, SAABs, and BMWs. I bought the car this past summer with 32K miles on the Audi CPO program. The brakes are touchy/grabby, but I\\'ve learned that\\'s a common trait with the A6, and I\\'ve learned to live with it and adjust. At 36K miles, the engine quit in traffic, and I had to have it towed to the dealer for repair. It turned out to be a faulty low fuel pressure sensor, and this was repaired under warranty. The following week, a simple daylight running light bulb went out, and this an only be repaired at the dealer!  Bought New - My 3rd and best A-6 This is my third Audi A-6 (had a 2000 and 2004 A-6 turbo 2.7 models). I thoroughly enjoy the car. It is by far the best vehicle I\\'ve owned. Drove it down to Virginia and back two weeks ago moving with traffic at 75+ and averaged 28 mpg on the highway. It accelerates nicely in Sport mode, has lots of room. The only real annoying problem I had occurred at 46,000 miles - the starter relay switch went - the car just wouldn\\'t start one rainy evening. I had to have the car towed, however Audi gave me a loaner, paid for the tow and repaired it quickly. It has more interior room than the Mercedes E  and BMW 5 series. I highly recommend this car. Bought used Bought from Schaumburg Audi with 75k.  Dealer and their service area have been awesome.  Haven\\'t seen service levels like theirs in any commercial area for a long, long time.  LOVE the style of the \\'08 and \\'09 A6s.  Preferred the turbo engine in the \\'09, but I was too cheap.  Lots of things in this car make it great fun to drive. Not sure if it\\'s worth it Amazing car to drive in the winter. The car looks great and is subtle but still turns heads. Great sound system and love the rear heated seats. But, the reliability on this car is horrible. I\\'ve never been to a dealership this many times. The check engine light has come on today for the 7th time in the last two years. I don\\'t care what the excuse is, a new 50k car should not have these kind of problems this early on with this few miles. I\\'m getting annoyed with this car, despite it\\'s capabilities during the winter. I wish Honda could just buy out their quattro awd system. It\\'d be the perfect marriage. Poor Audi Quality I am not impressed with Audi build quality or reliability.  In the first month of ownership, I had to have the dealer replace a howling power steering pump.  The car has a sunroof water leak that the dealer can\\'t fix.  The floor gets wet in a hard rain storm. Otherwise, performance and handling are quite good as are the electronics on the car. So far, so good First luxury car I have owned and very pleased after two years; lots of bells and whistles, even on the standard model (only option was i-pod interface).  Build quality excellent - solid as a bank vault.  Only complaints are touchy brakes, accelerator lag, and annoying buzzes and rattles that I mostly fixed by stuffing cracks with felt.  Great gas mileage 22-37 mpg.  Not what I was expecting I sold my M3 because my kids were getting too big for the back seat and my wife couldn\\'t drive a stick.  I owned a 2004 Allroad at one point and loved it so I thought it\\'d be cool to come back to Audi.  Well, now it\\'s three weeks later and I just sold it for a BMW 535.  The seats, while nice, offer very little support when going through hard turns.  The headroom is terrible - I\\'m 6\\' 3\" and my hair brushed the headliner every time.  The car is very smooth - almost too smooth.  I felt like I was driving a luxury yacht.  Performance of the V8 is pretty good and with good mileage.  If you like to float in luxury, this is your car, but if you\\'re looking for a little better driving experience, pass. Annoying quirks Our Audi for the most part has been fabulous. However in the 2 years we\\'ve owned the car, we\\'ve only put 7,500 on it and our check engine light has come on 3 times.  Perhaps its dishonest gas pumps, but we always use the premium gas.  Its very annoying to have to take it in for service, get no real details,  a couple of dings on the car and not even a car wash at our local dealership.  Even though its been a nice ride for the most part,  I\\'d like to get rid of it before something major blows. Not happy! Well have had my a6 for just 2 yrs now and 40,000 miles and the problems just keep on coming. First was the seat controls separating from the seat at 17,000 and not covered under warranty charged $40 to tighten bolt. Next was the xenon headlight going on and off, dealer said it was what they do when they are about to go bad $350. Then car started to run rough and engine light on told computer issue but that did not fix it. Then back to shop to find out it was carbon build up. Major engine work, fixed under warranty this time otherwise over $1,000 to fix. Dealer said that its because the gas today is not high enough octane to work with audis new engine design. Whats next? My last Audi. Plagued with problems My A6 continues to be plagued with problems. Spent 10 days in the shop over thanksgiving. Oil seals on all 6 cylinders had to be replaced. A major job on a car with only 12k miles. The carbon buildup issue which was initially attributed to a computer reprogram turned out to be failing seals. I also mentioned a rattle/squeak from the front left suspension; dealer greased the suspension per Audi directives but to no avail. Car was in the shop for 1 week. Now it turns out that it may be a bushing problem (a known issue amongst Audis) and I am being asked to take the car back again.  BTW - JDPower only gives the A6 a 6 rating which is on the cusp of below average.  Better than Expected For a large car, the A6 handles very well. I come from a smaller sports car so driving the A6 took some getting used to. The steering is soft, but responsive. Starts are slow, but once she\\'s up to speed, the power is awesome! Passing slower vehicles is not a problem. The interior is plush and comfortable and there\\'s nothing better when driving at night with all the lights on. Having the controls on the console was awkward at first since it is difficult to change settings while driving. I don\\'t suggest it! However, once set up, voice activation is the key to easy and safe operation. Although difficult to comprehend at first, once learned, the MMI and navigation system is a cinch to use. Best Audi Yet This is my fourth Audi, second A6.  Best of them all!  The power is great, smooth ride, unbeatable interior quality/design. I know that there are cars that are quicker, better handling, flashier, more powerful, etc, but no other car, taken as a package, does it all better than this A6.  Can\\'t beat quattro in the snow and rain.  After 17K miles:  NO PROBLEMS AT ALL, just changing the oil every 5K (not the factory recommended 10K). 1st Audi A6 review Beautifully designed inside and out. Great drive. BOSE sound system is incredible.  My A6 performed flawlessly the 1st year but then problems started. At 9k miles the # 5 cylinder coil had to be completely replaced. At 10k miles, carbon buildup caused the check engine light to come on again. The on-board computer had to be reprogrammed. In addition to all this, Audi\\'s consume oil like no other car I\\'ve ever owned. I literally have to drive around with a quart of oil in my trunk because it needs to be constantly topped up. 5 times this year alone.  Finally, the front suspension is starting to creak on rough roads and it\\'s getting progressively louder.  Disappointing for a car this new. She\\'s beautiful I\\'ll agree with the editor\\'s reviews that the low-end torque is an issue. She\\'s just a bit slow off the starting line, but she shines once she\\'s on the road. There\\'s plenty of pedal when you need it, and I think she runs the best slightly above the recommended speed limit. I\\'ve owned Toyota\\'s, BMW\\'s and of course American cars. The Audi is my favorite to date. You won\\'t be sorry, if you go this direction. I\\'m always getting compliments on this car, yet you don\\'t feel too \"cocky\" driving it. Disappointed We\\'ve been a Volvo family for over 15 years and decided to \"step up\" to an Audi after thorough research and test drives. The car is beautify, spacious, and has more gadgets than we need but the kids love it. The ride is spectacular. However, in just 14 months we have had to take the car back 5 times for check engine light. One of the Cylinders (#5) they tell us is bad. The car has stalled on my wife stranding her and my daughter at the side of the road. We are delighted with their road-side assistance and loaner program but frankly miffed that we\\'ve had to use it about every other month. At this time we are not happy with our decision. I also see others have had the same issue. 3 Audi\\'s in 2 months...This is the best! I have a fully loaded Q7 and love it for its size and looks. But my husband has wanted another Audi so we went out and got a fully loaded A6. Could not be happier with it.  After being pleased with Audi we went out and got another one a R8 for the power. But out of all of the cars we like the A6 the best for its looks and power and all the stuff you can get on it. Such as Keyless go (we payed extra to get that installed) Navigation, backup camera, and sensors, the blinds in the back, wood steering wheel.   First Audi Previously had a BMW 5 and loved it. No problems. Decided to try the A6 and am very pleased. Performance is more than I expected and the quality of the car\\'s interior is impressive. The car is very quite and seems well built. Handling is great as is the fuel mileage. Sporty Luxury From the outside to the inside, the A6 has beautiful features. The interior is plush and comfortable. The seat positions take you from a sports car feel to an executive luxury car. The MMI & sound system is fantastic, but I\\'m disappointed that the iPod integration is not on voice activation. Took a few days to master, but once understood, the MMI is easy to operate. Sensational  Looks Love the  exterior classy lines, interior is beautiful.  The Bose sound system and iPod integration is fantastic. However the jury is still out on the handling. The car seem to have a lot of play in the steering and very poor weight distribution, also I find the car to have poor visibility.  The Navigation System and Blue Tooth leaves a lot to be desired.  (German car engineers should take note of Japanese technology). The S line looks great with its wider tires, but has very stiff seats.  All in all the car feels very solid, and luxurious. Best value and styling in its class My wife and I spent over a month researching and test driving midsize luxury cars and when it was all done, the Audi A6 was the clear winner. About 6 weeks later we have no regrets. It\\'s styling and build easily surpass its competitors. The MMI is not that difficult to learn. My wife, no techie, but has mastered it and is now a big fan of the system. It just takes a little patience to learn a new way of doing things. iPod interface is excellent and the NAV system is very well implemented. Lane assist is a great safety feature and works well. I much prefer the Audi to BMW, MB or Lexus. For us, the runner up was the Infinity M35. Amazing Vehicle, some bothersome issues 3rd Audi, and extremely happy with how the deign has matured.  Smooth cornering, pick up, quiet cabin, butter start up process, intuitive controls.   This car is awful. Bad is too mild  Reading good reviews by the editor as well as some owners, my daughter decided to give it a try...I wish she did not. The car has 10,500 miles on it. It is 1.5 years old. She came here to Milwaukee for a funeral. On the way from Chicago the yellow light came on. As soon as she got out of the highway the car stalled. She called the road assistance as well as the leasing company and they told her to try starting it. The car started. They told her that since this is just the yellow light drive it and bring it in when you are back. On the way to the funeral the car stalled again 3 times! She had to borrow mine, left the car parked on the street. This is the Audi/German luxury  Very Satisfied!   This is my 2nd Audi A6 and the 2008 sure does beat out my old \\'00 A6. Everything is much improved. I avg. 31 MPG on the highway and 18 in the city. The only thing I truely miss is the ol\\' twin turbo.  It would have been nice to have it again. This is a very solid care. Great stereo. By far the best cruise control I have ever seen. The NAV is a must, extremely accurate and again one of the best I\\'ve seen. Handling is tight as you dive into turns. I\\'ve had many 4 wheel drive trucks and cars and I can assure you this car with stock tires never fails me while traveling through the Pocono Mtns in PA. The brakes are undescribable. The car stops on a dime. Excellent car!  Great car, highly recommend Couldn\\'t be happier with the car. Considered the normal peers (E350 4matic, 530x, Acura RL, M35x, etc). Drove them all but felt that the A6 was the best overall package - drive, interior and exterior styling, options/ capabilities, etc) - and importantly at the most attractive price. Have owned BWM (330ci), Audi (A4), Acura (Legend) and spent a lot of time in MB (E) and Lexus (GS). Like my A6 better than any of them.  Nice! Overall the A6 is an excellent car.  I have had it for a week and I\\'m in love everything about  the car.  The only thing I don\\'t really like is the cupholders, not very conviniently located but no biggie. It doesn\\'t have many places to put stuff though, glove compartment is rather small and center arm rest is small also. Other than that the car is awesome. Would have liked a wooden steering wheel standard for such a high price car.   I love this car Past vehicles include Lexus, BMW, Porsche and this one ranks right up there with the. Got rid of BMW 330CI convertible and SUV for one year round vehicle and this is the perfect fit. Was concerned about lack of power, but dropping it down into sport mode completely changes the character of this car. ( the \"S\" under the \"d\" in the tranny is not 2nd it is sport mode). Handling is fantastic and a blast to drive on curvy, winding roads. Not sure what a prior post was talking about, however, I have v6 not the v8. This 4 door sedan is as fun to drive as my BMW convt. Smooth,comfortable, stable, classy, elegant, sporty, roomy and AWD for these WI winters. Average 29mpg on a 250 mile trip. Not much to complain about, I like this car more than I imagined I would. Thought I was sacrificing sport/fun for year round comfort. I did not. My New Audi A6 I have had MBs 280, 380, 560, 430, 600 BMWs 740 (2), Porsche Carrera 4, Maserati and others, oh and of course an Audi S4 - and I think I have finally grown up, at least it feels like it. This is a car that feels any bit as nice, maybe better, as my 2002 MB 430S, both ergonomically, aestetically and has more gadgets than I need, but I use them all, bluetooth, i-pod, Nav system (far out) and has a great ride. Ok, so the 6 Cyl. may not be a V8, but it is plenty peppy and I am happy.  Dissapointment I looked at all cars that could possibly fit my criteria. I wanted top performance in a 4 wheel drive car. I finally settled on the A6. Although this car is fantastic in so many ways,the lack of road feel and poor wieght distribution is very unsettling. I can\\'t understand why they would build a great car, but which lacks basic handling characteristics.  My daughter\\'s \\'06 Accord has much better road feel and handling characteristics than this car. I would even go so far as to say this car is quite dangerous if you try to drive it on a curvy road at high speed. The V8 is too much power for the poor handling. I am very dissapointed I wish I would have gone with the BMW Best Car I\\'ve ever owned! Amazing vehicle. Smooth ride, plenty of power. Great easy to use features on the interior. Fantastic! Better than you expect. The 2008 A6 replaced my 2001 A6. While the 2001 A6 was a solid car, Audi has upped their game significantly with the 2008. The build quality is outstanding - equal or better than my wife\\'s MB E320. The interior is beautiful, a great blend of class and high tech. The car is very fun to drive, tight in turns, plenty of pep for a V6 and the MPG is far better than the the gov\\'t ratings - 26/27mpg in mixed driving, 30+mpg on the road. The MMI system with the Bose/Sirius is easy to use, and the high tech display is excellent. The cabin is very quiet, so you can really enjoy the great sound system - great improvement from the Audi Symphony system in my 2001 A6. Overall, this is a terrific car.  A Fine German Piece of Engineering I was in the market for an all-wheel drive german executive car, so my choices were the MB E350 4Matic, BMW 535xi, or the Audi A6 3.2, and I went with the Audi. And I really think I made the right choice. I don\\'t like the idea that underneath it\\'s a Passat, but the interior styling is unmatched and look nothing alike. The Quattro system works beautifully in all conditions. I\\'m getting about 31MPG average, which is great for this sized car. I\\'m just slightly disapointed with the acceleration. When merging on a highway(especially in NJ!), it\\'s somewhat lazy and throttle response isn\\'t as immediate as I hoped for. Like all Audi.s, the ride is firm, so beware of long trips.  Close to a 10 My third A6 offers loads of improvements over its earlier siblings. Ride is significantly more solid. Handling is so precise it\\'s like a vacuum sucking the backtop. Engine performance is powerful and at least 10% more economical than the 3.0 in my previous 2003 A6. Views are stimulating from approaching the vehicle to behind the wheel. Several minor cost cutting steps should be noted: more narrow seats and thinner cushions than the previous models, door pockets are \"cheaper,\" manual fuel filler door replaces and automatic release, head restrants no- longer swivel. I also miss oil temp. and volt gauges.  Amazing Vehicle This is my second Audi A6 and this is an entirely new vehicle that was redesigned from the bottom up. On a 350 mile trip at avg speed of 75mph I got 30 MPG!  Quiet cabin, great ergonomics,and the NAV is the best I have ever seen. The sound system is fantastic. Headlights are improved. I did find the sunroof to be a little small but it is not as important compared to all the positives. 2008 Audi A6 Driving dynamics are brilliant. The car rides like a train on the rails. There is no slipping nor sliding. Quattro system makes sure of that. Every mechanical component works in total harmony with each other. The interior appointments must be an envy of every other automaker. From the incredible ergonomics to the impeccable attention to the slightest details, this car clearly is a winner. Top Notch Performance - All Year Round! I have owned Lexus, BMW, Volvo, Jaguar, Acura and this is my second Audi.  Living in Canada with the relatively harsh winters and hot/humid summers I have found that the Quattro system in the Audi is by far the best I have ever driven for all year driving.  Interior fit and finish and the intuitive design/layout make it something that I haven\\'t had to this extent in any of the previously owned or tested cars.  Each time my lease is up I go out and test each of the previously mentioned manufacturers, plus Infiniti, and go through all the pros and cons, including cost, performance, all year maintenance, and passion for the car.  Service has been top notch! Great car all around. The Beast  With this car I am fully in control and it grabs the ground like an ice pick to ice, the growl of the engine just makes you wanna go faster and faster, this car is by far better than any BMW out there, with its AWD platform you can make curves like they were straight lines. The Manufacturer to Follow! We researched, watched and waited for just the right sedan to come to market.  I compared features, performance, comfort and reliability for all sedans in the A6 category and there is no other car that would rank higher than 8.5 now or in the next years model.  The steering capability with the S-Line sports suspension is what makes driving this car so much fun yet comfortable.  I love the unique color (Daytona Grey) in a time when almost everything on the road is the same.  The ability to power hard into your corners smoothly will never make you feel like you purchased something second rate.  The MMI is fabulous and intuitive.  My wife went from the A4 to this and just loves it immensely. 2008 Audi A6 4.2 - The Perfect Car My previous car was a Porsche Cayenne S, a 350 hp nimble beast of an SUV. It was a blast to drive. I thought I would never find a replacement. The Porsche is a distant memory now that I am driving the Audi A6 4.2. It is nice to be driving a sedan instead of an SUV. The ride is super smooth, quiet and with 350 hp this car can really take off. Audi has done a fantastic job with the fit and finish as well as integrating state of the art technology without overloading the instrument bay. The outside of the car is elegant and tasteful. The 2008 A6 4.2 comes standard with the S-Line font grille and bumpers which add a nice flare to the body. Audi A6 3.0T Quatro We really liked this car - everything about it was great, except recently it started using about a quart of oil every 800 miles (never had a car use oil like this and this is our 7th Audi). It is not leaking nor visible in the exhaust - we are thinking of trading only because of the oil usage. Car Pit Whatever you do, do not buy an Audi or have your car serviced at this dealership.We own and Audi A-6 Turbo 2009.It is in the shop more than not.The Ft. Collins dealership where we bought the car did not stand by a tire warranty and we had to contact Audi North America.We wound up buying 4 tires out of pocket because one went bad and they did nothing!.Further there was a $1500 part that came out of nowhere they claimed needed to be replaced.Audi split the difference with us.Out of loyalty we went back to Ft. Collins for a normal 80K service, over an hour drive.On the way home the radio stopped working.  Coolant pump failure I have the car for 1 year now, it has been in the shop for repairs 3 times. The first problem was with the coolant pump, the second problem with the LED headlights and the third problem with the coolant pump. The front bumper had to be removed to replace the headlights and the dealer put the first scratch on the car during the process. the first coolant pump issue happened on the parkway and the car had to be towed, the second time I drove it a few miles after the warning light came on. There is a persistent rattle in the dashboard. It\\'s a nice car with a bad reliability rating, I was used to the Mercedes Benz e350 which never gave me a problem. That will be my next car at lease end. Really want to love this car but I have had the car for a little over a year and it has been at the dealership for repair 12 times. They have replaced both headlights, re-installed the MMi software twice, replaced the phone module, searched for the source of a strong coolant smell after the car sat for a week and spent days attempting to eliminate a persistent rattle in the dash. There is still a rattle in the back seat, but I think I will just live with it.  The car has run fine and is fun to drive and nice to look at, but I shutter to think what will break next. Great Looking but Unreliable Have my 2009 A6 for less than a year and it has been in for a service call at least 5 times up to date. Headlights, engine problems with only 6500 miles. What a shame! Great looking automobile that is extremely unreliable.  Wow, very impressed I was not ready for a new vehicle, however given the fact that my 2004 Jaguar XJ8 with low mileage had slowly become the money pit, I decided to check out an Audi while my Jag was being serviced.  WOW is really the only word to describe the vehicle.  From an aesthetics point of view, the interior is amazing.  My car has black / amaretto interior, everyone loves it.  The MMI is easy enough to learn but I am still working on it.  Performance is amazing.  Really have to watch the speeds on the highway.  Handling feels like the A6 is riding rails.  Huge trunk with fold down seats is a plus. Great Choice After years of rotten service from Mercedes, I switched to Audi and I am thrilled.  Superior quality, supercharged engine that really takes off and the large sedan handles like small sports car.  I have owned 2 Mercedes, a Porsche and a Lexus and this is the best by far.  I\\'m looking forward to Seattle\\'s rain and snow! Drive it! The new Audi A6 quattro with 3.0L supercharged engine must be driven to be fully appreciated. The speed and agility of this car are outstanding, with 0-60 in 5.9 seconds it compares directly with the 4.2L engine at $5,000 less. Unless you need greater torque for towing there is no need for the bigger and less fuel efficient engine.  After owning Mercedes and Porsches for more than 25 years, the build quality and perfection of this Audi is outstanding. We have the Prestige package which includes Bluetooth phone, ipod dock and rear view camera. The interior is beautiful and comfortable with all the creature comforts imaginable. The MMI system and voice command is easy and intuitive to use. Superbowl commercial got me Yes Jason Statham made a sale.  Black/black premium plus.  This car rides significantly better than the 2008 A6.  The dealer had a new 2008 for 10k less.  I felt it bucked back and forth over \"normal\" Wisconsin winter roads.  I couldn\\'t have driven one.  The 2009 handled the same roads much better.  I\\'m only a few hundred miles in so far but it\\'s clear this is an amazing vehicle.  Never harsh over potholes and has higher lateral limits than I\\'m willing to test so far.  The supercharged v6 feels strong but I\\'m still in the break-in period.  Love the mmi integration with my iPhone.  All of my music and Bluetooth built in.  Quattro AWD is impressive. Audi misleads on A-6 I ordered a 2009 A-6, 4.2, Garnet Red, and according to the Audi website the car was to have the S-Line interior.  When the car came it had the plain interior without the more comfortable sport seats.  I was then told after the fact that the S-Line was no longer available.  Obviously the website was misleading. I have owned 2002, 2006, and 2008 A-6\\'s.  I will never buy another Audi because of this deception. Better than any SUV or CUV built! This sucker is the best car ever for Wisconsin winter driving.  My bride would be lost without the Quattro technology driving to work at 5 am. This machine handles in snow like a snowmobile. No cotton-pickin lousey SUV can do it better unless perhaps it happens to be yet another Audi. I am dumping my GMC 4WD Suburban to get another Audi Quattro Avant! Tank Solid Reliable Luxury We\\'ve been very pleased at the quality and reliability of this Avant quattro.  In silver, it looks fantastic.  Audi/VW had relied on this 12V V6 motor for several of its platforms, and after living with it, and having no problems at all, I can see why.  At 172 bhp, it is a little under-powered, but does great at speed.  Leather interior holds up well if regularly treated.  Quattro drive grips the road, dry, wet, or in ice and snow.  We drove through a blizzard up a mountain and were passing some SUVs that were struggling.  The pop-up rear-facing seats work great for our small kids and cousins, plus, they love riding back there.  Interior cargo room is pretty good with rear seats folded down. Wow! Nice Car! I picked up my 1997 Audi A6 with 93,000 miles on it.  I changed the timing belt and water pump (now ready for 75,000 more miles or whatever Audi recommends), rear calipers (hand brake portion rusted), popped in 6 CDs in the CD changer, and thats it.  The sun roof needs to be rebuilt ($500), but it works OK if you don\\'t go all the way to the rear.  This car screams in snow!  Wow!  I went over 105,000 miles on recent trip to the Appalichian Mountains, got a flat tire, and didn\\'t even know it on the hard turns, etc., for about 25 miles (not recommended).  Afterwords, the tire was ok.  Highly recommend HS Michelin all season tires.  They are a great match!    This is a GREAT car, er...wagon! Even if it is a wagon, it is a kick-a** wagon. We have become firm belivers in ABS after almost having a head on collision with a moose near Yellowstone. The comfort level is outstanding, and the quattro AWD system has been perfect for our Colorado lifestyle. Super fun to drive I bought this car new over 20 years ago.  Even though I have had various repairs done, I still cannot part with it.  163000  miles, Yea the paint is pealing, but it  still drives better than my Subaru, Land cruiser, or mercedes Benz.   Never had the engine apart, no transmission issues, no electrical issues.  3 output shaft seals, rear brake rotors, calipers, parking brake cables, these are the aggrivating repairs.  Also 3 water pumps, timing belts.  But the car sure drives nice.  Probably should thing of getting rid of it , but just can\\'t part ways.  Nothing drives like a Quatro in rain or snow. 1997 A6 Quattro Great car, I bought it used 6 years ago as the \"kids car\" but use it as mine now that they are out of the house (I drive back and forth to the commuter rail station), its great in snow and I have a very steep & difficult New England driveway and the Audi always gets up there, its really comfortable, this is the second A6 version I\\'ve owned (the first was the first kids car was the wagon version, but I had to get rid of it at 200K miles); this one only has 100K so I hope to keep it a long while, its really durable and looks almost new for a 18 year old car, I miss having a wagon thoughÂ\\x85it doesn\\'t move all that fast, but neither do i. The Real Audi I bought my A6 Quattro new and now it gained over 200K of mileage and still going strong. The weather changed its states unpredictably but my A6 didnt change a bit of its performance. I have now owned another Audi (S7 Sportback) and since the first, I have not looked at other German made brand. \"Truth in Engineering\", that\\'s right. Gotta Get One I was lucky to find this car(2.8L Quattro), I brought it with 215,000miles on it. Had to replace the engine($1500). Now it runs like a champ. I baby it, but if you see me at a red light, she can get up. Its an over all great car performance and comfort wise. Gas mileage can be better but it\\'s still overall a great car to own. So if you don\\'t have one \"YOU NEED TO GET LIKE ME\" 1997 Audi A6 Review This has been the best car I have ever owned. I live in NE Ohio in \"snow belt\" country, and the A6 eats snow and ice and slush as well as my F-250 4x4. I don\\'t get tired driving it, whether it\\'s my short commute or occasional multi-hour trip. Great ergonomics. I\\'m a car nut, and every time I think about buying a new car I hold it up to the A6 for comparability. Most are found wanting. New Audis aren\\'t cheap, but my experience with the car makes me want to look at low-mileaged used A6s for $27k rather than purchase a new Honda Accord or Toyota Camry with a lot of their bells and whistles. Buy a USED Audi I bought a 1997 Audi A6 with 70,000 miles about 3 years ago for $13000 CDN. It needed a steering rack when I bought it. Since that time I replaced the catalytic converters, ignition switch and brakes and tires. Probably 1500.00 average for repairs. It runs great and if you do the math, it is the only way to buy a safe luxury car. I absolutely love it. About a year ago I was rear ended. The other car had to be towed away, and I had a small licence plate mark in the paint. Id buy another Audi in an instant. Good Car I just sold my A6--I had it for 2 years exactly.  It was amazing in the snow and made wet roads seem dry.  This was by far the best feature of the car.  It was very comfortable (seating and ride), more so than most BMWs I\\'ve driven.  The main reason I got tired of this car was it\\'s lack of power.  I mean it\\'s not slow but you have to floor it to take a camry at a stoplight.  Handling is good.  The fact that I could not have a cd changer or deck installed really irritated me--the only way you can listen to cd\\'s is buying a FM modulator ($250).  Bottom line is it\\'s a kinda boring car. Thats why I got a 3-series now. 1997 Audi A6 Quattro Every car has lemons so take this review for what it is.  See suggested improvements for electrical problems.  My 1997 Audi A6 quattro Sedan drives smoothly and has moderate to good acceleration at highway speeds (none to speak of off the line -- low end torque simply isnt there).  The steering is unrivaled compared to all other cars I\\'ve driven, if only there wasn\\'t this nagging hydrolic problem every winter that makes a very loud noise and stiffens the power steering.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this car. I don\\'t like it and it ended up costing me a great deal of money in the end. All about the Design The two main reasons I picked my \\'97 Audi A6 \\rwere its AWD and the exterior design.  I \\rlive in Idaho and like to ski.  This \\rcar goes up the mountains with no \\rproblem.  And looks great downtown.  I \\rdidn\\'t like the look of the 1998 models \\rcoming out.  The \\'97 A6 is flatter, not \\rso rounded like every other car on the \\rmarket.  More like a race car.  The \\rexterior design was what really excited \\rme about the car. Oh, and the black \\rcolor.  Very cool. Take care of it & it\\'ll take care of U The A6 (C4 platform) is a great value, \\rwhen purchased used. Mine is a high \\rmileage car (127K) and it still runs \\rand looks like (almost) new. Keep in \\rmind that it needs some preventative \\rcare (not just the regular oil change) \\rin order to keep it running flawlessly. \\rTiming belt (yes belt, not a chain like \\rmost Beemers) need to be replaced every \\r60-75k. While doing this you should \\ralso replace the water pump, because \\rit\\'ll break down at some point, and \\rthis will save you a lot of $$$$. Check \\rand top off the differential/tansaxle \\rfluids twice a year. Wear and tear \\rrepairs done: Front wheel bearing, \\rfront CV boot, timing belt and water \\rpump, differential seal. Quattro The 1997 Audi a6 is a  weather monster \\rperform perfect with the \"Quattro\" awd \\rsystem and no 1 can do it better than \\raudi. Has a great fight at the red line\\r Awesome Ride I absolutely love this car.  It\\'s like \\ra rock on the road.  Extremely \\rcomfortable, ample power, very good \\rhandling in all types of weather.  Very \\rsmooth shifting (auto trans).  My only \\rcomplaint is the location of the cup \\rholder. 50,000 miles, sell it! 80,000 but it. Take a look in the paper, selling any \\rgerman vehicle.  They are all at of \\rnear 50,000. Many past owners have \\rfigured this out,  These cars fall \\rapart at this mileage.  Once they are \\rfixed  They are great cars again for \\ranother 50-100k.  Typical issues; \\rcooling problems (really bad), \\rtransmission leaks and weird \\relectrical bugs. After $1,500 in \\rrepairs we are good to go for another \\r50k.  Don\\'t take your car to Audi, for \\rrepairs after the warranty runs out. \\rThey will make you want to sell the \\rcar after you get the bills.  Smooth German Machine This car performs amazing well in all \\rtypes of weather. I can see why people \\rlove Audi\\'s so much. Just when you \\rthink that you\\'re going to lose it in a \\rsnow or rain storm, the quattro system \\rcomes to the rescue. I will never go \\rback to a rear or front wheel drive car \\ragain. Power is decent for a car of \\rthis size (but if you want a real \\rrocket, look for the S6 version of this \\rcar [1995 model year]).

Looks like and is often \\rmistaken for  a new car due to \\rexcellent paint job& body style. The \\rcar has been very reliable & low \\rmaintence This is a nice car This is a nice car.

Good Car Great Handling Vehicle feel safe  A  Positive Viewpoint Purchased our wagon with the intent of making long trips (Seattle to Boston) in comfort. The car exceeded our expectations in all areas. 29.5 mpg at75mph all day long for a car this size is as good as it gets. Around town I get 22-23mpg.  Car has plenty of power, corners well, ride is more involved than a Lexus. Since new I have had 1 rattle (fixed at the free 15k mile svc). No further problems. Tires still look as if they have another 20k mi on top of the 27k they have now. Anyone looking at a wagon or an SUV should consider an \\'06 Avant. Audi depreciation makes this a great buy for you; an incentive for me to keep mine for 10 years. Electronics can be a hassle Car drives very well, fantastic road holding. Engine is strong but unrefined and loud. Electronics are a major hassle, battery often goes out and can\\'t hold charge because the electronics drain it. Warning lights constantly on for some computer malfunction. You cant switch the varous sensors and warning off so be prepared to make the dealer your second home. Always an issue with something electronic. Car barely drives a day without some kind of electronic kink. 2006 Audi A6 Wagon I drive 120 miles daily to Santa Cruz CA, up over the mountains (dreadful highway 17).  For this the car is great!  When it rains the road becomes treacherous and the car holds the road and stops better than everyone else.  A real plus!  The car is comfortable, quiet and makes the commute quite bearable. Bad Decision to Buy I love to drive my Avant. The ride is supreme and handles great on dry or wet roads; winter driving is very disappointing.  The vehicle was shipped and delivered with obvious flaws in the trim and rear window glass.  Several MMI modules had to be replaced, also a rear light module, and the adaptive shocks squeak and moan so badly it ruins the fun of driving the car; one strut has already been replaced and another is in need.  The navigation is unreliable and does not recoginze obvious short cuts. Greatly lacks in quality and reliability. Style  This is my second Audi A6 Avant (wagon).  I love the outdoors, and this car is a perfect compliment.  This past winter, I\\'ve skiied in the Sierra Nevada Mtns almost every weekend.  Huge snows.  Even with the stock M&S tires, this car performs magically.  The A6 Quattro definitely inspires confidence. car Never thought I\\'d EVER drive a wagon again once the kids were grown.  But this is easier to manuever than an SUV. It is really a great, responsive vehicle! I wish the cupholders were better positioned and without that rubber piece that keeps your cup stuck in the holder.  The rear view mirror can be really tricky to put back on if it comes off (as ours did). The navigation system is great; we have a BMW also and this navigation system is FAR superior to that!  Great car It drives like it is on rails, it is like the car is focused on the road. I never had a 4 wheel drive, that may have something to do with the fantastic driving experience. I have only driven about 4000 miles so I can\\'t say how the reliability will be but sofar nothing is wrong or negative. My previous car was a Lexus LS400, but you cannot compare that one with the new Audi A6, I thought I would do a step back, instead it is a jump forward. The best car I\\'ve ever owned My 2006 Audi A6, which I bought new, has been the best car I\\'ve ever owned. The handling, comfort, and fuel economy are great for a car of its size. It has been highly reliable and, at almost 13 years and 115,000 miles, is still a pleasure to drive and to look at. The only negative is the lack of modern safety/technology features, and it is for that reason alone that I\\'m thinking of trading it in soon. Most Luxurious 98,000 mile life disposable car Ok, well we loved this car, then hate this car, then love this car, and so on... It all comes down to reasonable and prudent reliability and quality of materials.  This was a 24000 mile pre-owned Audi certified car we purchased.  Driven lightly for the last 5-6 years, garage kept 1/2-2/3 of the time owned.  What\\'s good?Performance, feel, and overall car experience were favorable.  Fuel economy is outstanding, especially highway.  Car has generally been trouble free, or so I thought (see What\\'s Bad).What\\'s Bad?Where to start.  1) Service intervals - we have had this into Audi every 10K per suggested and every time we leave with no less than a $400 bill gone for what I would have normally thought was a Jiffy Lube type $65 event.  They ALWAYS find something wrong that needs to be fixed or replaced, or updated - and being a good Audi owner I comply since I want my Audi to be in top shape all the time. 2) Absolutely $%## poor quality of materials on interior knobs, dials, and trim.  Just google it and you will see lots of people with delaminated interior trim.  Audi chooses to turn the other way though and does not recall this to fix an obvious mfg defect.  Its a calculated risk for them I assume thinking not enough care - I do and on this alone, I will never buy Audi again.  I tried to sell my car (which is otherwise in great shape) and everyone was turned off by paint peeling off of the various knobs and dials.  3) Power Steering - Developed a leak at 65K miles.  Too expensive to repair on my quickly depreciating car - no return on investment there, so just keep adding the $30/pint Audi fluid as need be.  4) Oil Use - uses about 1 US Quart of $8 synthetic oil every 4K miles.  No matter what they say, this seems excessive.  My Ford Explorer had 200K and used 1/3 of that.  5) Technology - Even in 2006, simple things like AUX jacks should be available.  There is no way to connect a device other than Radio Frequency Module - which suck.  My 2002 Corolla was better than that.   6) Navigation is ok, not great.  Its so outdated and Audi wants you to pay $300+ for their map update CDs....residual income for them I guess.  7) Battery - The $180 battery that goes with this only makes it about 12-14 months then dies.  Get a good one with a warranty since you will be using it A LOT.  8) And now for the 95,000 interval (I had to wait to 98,000...shame on me).  Remember that the car has been factory serviced every 10K since 24K miles....  8a) Windshield washer pump was shorted out $400 - had to fix this since its a safety item.  8b) windshield washer blades - there are no auto store or aftermarklets available.  Audi must provide these @ $60.  8c) Oil and filter change @ $400.  Up to $800 now.  8d) take a guess...bad battery $180 (I declined since mine is Autozone and under warranty).  8e) Motor mounts are bad (huh?) - $1300 - I declined.  8f) Adaptive headlight sensor error - must remove front end to check it $1200 (for a light that is still shining? LOL) - I declined. 8g) Rear brake light error - tech tried to check this but the lens covers were too brittle.  New ones cost $1200 - again LOL - I declined.  8h) Front end bushings need replaced - $1800 - I declined.  8i) Oil leak noticed around timing and valve cover - $1500 - I declined.  I stop them here.  This $6,500 car is way past its service life at 98,000 miles.  Didn\\'t even make it to 100K - wow for a $65K automobile.I share my experience with the first person I see who I knew had a A3 with 50,000 miles on it.  They just traded theirs in after their service call quoted them thousands of dollars in very similar repairs and failures.  Different dealership, different auto groups so no suspicion there.  I assume its just a fact that an Audi is disposable ($0 value) after 8-10 years or 50-90K miles.  Well, I hear scrap metal is $3/100 pounds so there is that..... Hurts to sell this one... Just traded in my 2006 A6 Quattro sedan 3.2 S-line with 117,500 miles for a 2016 Prestige A6 3.0 and while the new model is fantastic, I hate stepping away from my 2006. This was my first Audi and the most enjoyable car I have ever owned.  Bought as CPO with 30k.  The 2006 was quick and handled like on rails. Quattro system is awesome in WI winters (especially equipped with Blizzak snow tires).  I had a few warranty issues before 50k (covered by Audi) and little to none since. I maintained my car well and it treated me right.  Local independent shop handled all needed work.  I\\'m am only selling for fear of costly repairs down the road which if I could predict to be reasonable, I\\'d keep it.  Lastly, the Bose surround system is the best factory car audio I have ever heard.  The misano red turns heads and many folks still think the 06 is a newer car.  If you don\\'t get hit with reliability costs, the 2006 is a GREAT value. 7 years and still like new I\\'ve owned a lot of cars.Many of which I cycled through as I got bored of them, or they just started to under perform and cause issues.I purchased this A6 with 5K on the clock and it currently has 65K.I do pamper it, but it returns its pampering with flawless performance with an engine roar that sounds better than the day I got it.Oh yeah and 7 years and there is not one bit of rust. Cheap to buy, Expensive to maintain I only had my A6 for 3 months. On the way home from the dealership (It was 5 hours away), the transmission went out. Only an Audi dealer can replace it, so it was a little over $5,000. Then the passenger seat switch broke. It was going to cost $300 to fix, but decided to leave it alone. Then a coolant pipe broke and costed $85 for the pipe plus $25 for the coolant you HAVE to use on Audis. Two days later I got a warning light and took it to the dealership. They adjusted some sensors but warned that a $11,000 repair was about a year away and recommended I traded it in, so I did. I only had the car for 4,000 miles. I am the worlds biggest Audi fan, but if you have to have one, buy one new. What a Porsche 911 Aspired to be, not too long ago... I\\'m amazed at how it sticks to rails as I corner. The heated steering wheel, racing seats, electric sun shades are all nice, but it is the performance in an understated sedan that impresses me most. When I look at how this model is rated by everything from The Robb Report to Road & Track against competitors many times its price, I\\'m grateful to have found this hidden gem. Yes it needs 9 quarts of oil but it\\'s built like a rock. Only problems have been buttons wearing out and headlights leaking, easy fixes. Rear air bag needs work too.  The perfect all-weather luxo tourer In Europe owning an Audi is a sign of success and knowledge..they lead the German pack. The German made cars such as this beautiful A6 Quattro as simply the best built cars in the world in this class. The secret to finding that pefect used Audi IMO is to buy it thru the same Audi dealer who originally sold it and it has full service history...all the petigree updates. The A6 is a computer with wheels so keeping it uptodate is critical but even a cheapo newer cars requires this maintience..yes you want to but high quality oil and filters simply because it\\'s a awd marvel. 2006 A6 Owner Do not by one of these unless you are willing to shell out $$ for service and repairs.Shortly after 80K you will notice small issue that result in very costly repairs, regardless of being diligent in regards to preventive maintenance.CVTs are not a good idea, the controller (TCM) tend to fail before the CVT, either way you are looking at a minimum of $2500. If you want an Audi buy one with a clutch or pay for extended warrenties, they are worth it. Not worth it Although it\\'s a beutiful, luxurious car, there are a lot of trouble spots. First, the oil change costs over $100 every time because it requires 7 quarts of synthetic plus oil. Next, the fuel economy is terrible. Gets no more than 15 on the city. Possibly 20 on the highway. Next, I had water pumps break under the car which resulted in flooding of the floor and a horrible mildew smell. This happened 3 times. Beautiful appearence, but too many cons to reccomend. Instead, I reccomend the Lexus GS or Infiniti M Great Styling but defective brakes  Nice car for the money. Beautiful interior and solid performance. Canyon red color is eye catching and unusual.  Brakes are annoying and 3 dealers could not fix the grab and squeal. Mileage with OEM tires was excellent. I replaced them at 30,000 miles with Bridgestone all season but poor roll resistance yields full 15% poorer mileage.  Stick with OEM Continental tires. Great Great, great ride. Fun to drive. Looks amazing and drives very well. Be wary of jealous neighbors. Great but... Well I\\'ve had this for 6 months. It now has 75k. I get 33 at 74 mph cruise for a comfortable 75mile ride to work. In winter the 1st upshifts are extra long;weird.  So I simply use manual shift for the first cycle. Small annoying rattle on cup holder cover that comes and goes. Other than that, it\\'s a dream.  Did my own 65k service using shop manual.  Not bad at all and saved about 1k. Sport mode is fun. The Interior is so so nice. My commute time has now become me time in a mobile man cave. MMI is great.  Truly a WOW car! This car has surpassed my expectations.  I am very pleased with its performance and sleek look.  It has many great features that require study of the manual.  But once you are comfortable with them, they are awesome.  If you want fun-to-drive, coupled with comfort and eye catching appeal, get yourself an Audi. Terrific CPO purchase I had finally outgrown my e36 m3 and decided to get a more austere sedan.  I shopped Infiniti, BMW and Audi.  I picked up a CPO 2006 A6 and couldn\\'t be happier with it.  The car drives wonderfully, although the V8 is a little thirsty if you keep your foot in it.  I expected that though.  The car is built very solid, and offers 90% of the 5er performance, but with a bit more comfortable ride.  I have non-sport suspension btw, and look to change that at some point, mainly to minimize the 3\" wheel gap (Toyota?). Otherwise, the car is gorgeous, and I look forward to keeping it for quite awhile.  I think an A6 is a terrific CPO purchase, the extended warranty could come in handy (hopefully not). Great car with hefty maintenance price I have the S-Line package. This car is a lot of fun to drive and handles better than most cars I\\'ve owned; the quattro AWD system certainly inspires confidence. For its weight, the car is a little underpowered with the V6 engine. Seats are a little firm and I can\\'t seem to adjust the driver\\'s seat just right. Long trips are still pretty easy. Rear seat has a lot of leg room. The female end of the center seat belt is recessed and hard to reach for practical use; definitely cannot use a car seat or booster seat in the center.  Other than that, car is very well built, gets a lot of looks from people, and is not all that common (making it even better!). Definitely German Pedigree This car was 23 months and had 15,000 miles when I bought it in 10/08. The car is a dream. It rides better and is more comfortable than any car I\\'ve ever had. It can float down the highway or play on mountain curves, whatever suits you. Even with the 8 cylinders, I get 28 mpg on the highway. In town is rough at 15, but I expected that. I like the fact that it has all the features of its better know competitors, but you don\\'t see as many of these on the road. If you see one for a good price, grab it before it runs away. The secret is getting out, Audi rocks.  Happiness is  I wanted a Quattro in the worst way but when this vehicle came to market, only 16K miles and loads of options I could not say no! Tons of interior space, truly well finished inside and out. Performance is good. The engine sounds great and I love the tranny. Unbelievably smooth and the sport mode is fun! The gas mileage is awesome. I just finished a 800 mile round trip and averaged 31.3 MPG. I set the cruise at 85 MPH and got this result. I don\\'t get it.. at 75 the result is lower, go figure! The MMI is easily learned and the sound system, Bose, is fantastic!  Love to Drive My Audi! This car is a blast to drive! Hugs the road like a coaster on rails. Quick, responsive, and an extremely smooth ride. MMI system is easy and reliable. The controls are driver friendly too. The luxury comforts are a dream. Driver\\'s seat hugs like a cockpit, and back seat is very roomy and very comfortable.  The trunk is huge!  If you really love to drive, I mean really love to drive, then this Audi is for you. I test drove Mercedes, BMW, and Infiniti. I am so glad that I chose my Audi, and I will forever more be an Audi lover.  Wow! I am very impressed with my Audi A6. We opted for the 4.2L V8 and have been very pleased with the performance. We looked at BMW and Mercedes, but there was no comparison with the luxury, technology, and of course the Quattro AWD. The car sticks to the road like glue in wet or dry conditions. The S- Line package makes the suspension so responsive that it is a pleasure to drive each time. The MMI is easy to use and the interior ergonomics fit like a glove. I\\'m sticking with Audi. Fun to Drive and Safe The quattro feature makes me feel as if I am riding on tracks. I have been in a number of snow and ice storms this winter in New England and never even slipped.  Amazing. It\\'s fun to drive, and every component, every feature fits perfectly with each other - there is nothing wrong with this car.   Service has lived up to expectations, Audi has gone out of its way to ensure a good experience. Best interior style, reliable fun Great experience, 25,000 mi and counting.  Audi replaced a faulty rear window (fog inside glass) upon delivery.  Love the mtce warranty.  No major repairs or issues, and NO minor ones either.  Best road handler out there, summer, fall and especially winter. Love this car in winter!  Cleans up real nice too, time and again. Lousy Audi Spent a total of 3 months at the dealer for repair of sunroof (3 times), noise in suspensions (never fixed - the dealer gave up, suggested I buy another car), blew transmission after 6300 miles. Again dealer suggested I should have bought a Quatro, instead of a CVT. Still has noises in the liner, suspension, rattles in the door and seats. Do yourself a favor, do not bay an Audi. Great Car - back it up Have a 2000 A6 Quattro. Still runs great - love the car.  Good thing for the warranty though as rotors and brakes went early.  Bought a 2006 3.2 quattro .Dealer told me the \"only change in warranty was that wiper blades were only warrantied for 1 year\". Guess what, six months later blades are shot & local dealer tells me they are no longer covered and it will cost me $50 to replace.  Had some electrical surprises - audio shutting off, no way to turn back on unless battery is disconnected & reconnected. Worse, my left front headlamp leaks & fogs.  When I made an appointment to have it fixed, they did not \"see\" it so I now have to wait for it to happen again. Excellent Car Having been a loyal BMW driver for many years, it was hard to even consider buying an Audi.  But with the less attractive styling of the BMW 5 series, i considered the Audi A6 and was very happy I did.  The Audi doesn\\'t quite have the pep and drive of a BMW, but the excellent Quattro all-wheel drive system and the incredibly attractive and comfortable interior make this car a real joy.  I\\'ve been very impressed by the car\\'s quality and dependability.  2006 A6 Quattro Nice ride, Great car for that Sunday drive out in the country good or bad weather. Best of the Mid-Luxury Sedans In my opinion, the A6 is the new standard for mid-luxury sedans.  Virtually all of its features - including handling, the console control system (MMI), and sleek looks -  make driving this car a pure pleasure.  Before buying, I compared the A6 to others in its price range, and it came out on top in almost all areas.  And among the German-brand sedans, here\\'s my humble opinion: If you want great performance, drive a BMW; if you want a luxurious feel, drive a Mercedes; if you want both, drive an Audi. And Away We Go! Beautifully thought out car... was delivered to me in pristine condition, not a thing to criticize.  Interior like a jet cockpit, driver fits in like a foot in a shoe.  Everything automatic, voice recognition works flawlessly.  Had to use the owner\\'s manual extensively for first 2 weeks, but then everything fits into place.  MMI really takes command of everything!  Almost 2000 miles, not a thing to complain about:  I just hope all the fancy electronics last as long as the rest of the car with no problems.  Lots of electronic convenience features I never had before in my 1999 Caddy Concours.  I\\'m sold on Audis if things keep up the way they are now! 06 A6 4.2 The car is tight, responsive and handles well. However, the engine is a little loud. The drawback to this vehicle is the brakes which are much too touchy. Difficult to glide to a smooth stop. The controls (radio,t emp, phone, navigation) are very handy and easy to use. Awesome Red S-Line This is the greatest driving car we have ever owned.  We love the look!  We bought the RED S-Line V-8 and it goes and stops like hell.  Although we only have 1500 miles on it we haven\\'t had any problems. The interior and exterior are beautifully assembled and the quality of the materials is top notch. The MMI system is easy to use but sometimes distracting. Very happy with my purchase My wife traded her A4 on an A6.  I liked driving hers so well, I traded in my IS 250 for one too!   Audi 3.2 Quattro well designed This car was a replacement for my wife\\'s 97 BMW 528i. This car is surprisingly quick and the transmission is the best \"auto\" I have ever had. The difference from her 4-speed BMW auto is amazing. This system always seems to know the right gear, downshifting as you brake so when you step on it you are in the correct gear. Handling is not on par with BMW. We could have opted for Sport suspension to fix that but got a great deal on a 2006 on the lot. Very very pleased Bought the 2006 A6 to replace a 1997 A6.  A quantum leap in technical sophistication, comfort and fit.  Seating very comfortable.  Highway noise almost non-existent.  Great acceleration and manuverability.  Only two minor manufacturing flaws, neither performance related. The MMI is easy enough to use, but it is distracting.  I live with a lot of wide open spaces, but with hundreds of satellite radio stations to choose from, you get distracted.  The on- wheel controls do not remedy this because of a lag in activating the tuning dial - the lag means you have to look away from the road to see where you are. The doors are very heavy, which I  equate with safe. I would happily buy this car again. 06 a6 At 6000 miles its been fun and no problems.  The 5000 mile service was friendly and thorough. The mileage has been a pleasant surprise as it\\'s constantly above 30 mpg on the highway. Audi - A6 WOW!! After driving American cars for over 35 years, I bought A6 (premium package). Wow ! What a difference. I looked at the competitors - no comparison! A6 has a better interior + power + everything else. Gas mileage is excellent (mid 20s combined). Handles very well.  Truly worth buying I chose the A6 against Merc E-class and BMW 5-series, just because I wanted to try something different, and this vehicle seemed promising when I visited the showroom. It offers fantastic grip on the road, and I have driven it at 155 mph frequently, without being worried. All the electronics offered in the car are also very useful and good. I never experienced any error in the car as yet (after using it for over a year).  I unfortunately didn\\'t get to buy a Quattro. Therefore, i am not much happy with the FWD of this car as it tends to slip a lot during acceleration. Incase if you are planning to buy the A6, then please go for the Quattro (AWD). It literally stands out. Stylish but lazy in performance I bought this car mainly because of its edgy new look & safety. Unfortunately the 3.2 A6 is sluggish off the line. Unresponsive while cruising on Drive, and the Sport mode seems to shift with too much of an advanced delay. This car is fine for a driver who doesn\\'t care about torque and responsiveness across the RPM line. 1st Audi after 4 BMWs WOW is all I can say.  And I\\'m sorry that I was a BMW \"snob\" for too many years.  I bought the Audi primarily because I was looking for AWD in the winter.  Having only had the car now for one month in the summer, I\\'m truly sorry that I didn\\'t consider an Audi prior to this.  This car is the ultimate driving machine!!! Great car! This is my second A6, and while I was pleased with my first one, the 2006 blows it away.  The  interior is fantastic.  The ride is silky smooth with powerful perfomance.  I love the nav system, but my favorite thing is the bluetooth integration.  I just bought a bluetooth phone specifically because my car has it - it\\'s great.  I recommend this car. Good Value Overall very pleased with this car. While it is not as silky smooth as others in this class it offers many pros including - good gas mileage (averaging mid -20\\'s), beautiful interior, and sporty handling and acceleration. I selected this car (after test driving the Acura RL, Mercedes E350 4matic, Lexus RX350) because it was the best value of vehicles that had AWD and all the advanced safety features. One major dislike - that steep angle of the windshield causes the dashboard to reflect on the windshield. Very annoying but fortunately it seems to be isolated to cloudy weather and less visible in bright sun and at night.  Audi A6 Having previously owned a Mercedes E55 I was skeptical when it came to acquiring an A6. So far it has met all my expectations and then some. Build quality and interior design are first rate. MMI easy to use. Great stereo and nav. Highly reccomend this as an excellent value for the money . A6 Review The new A6 is out of this world! Fun to drive - great performance and excellent redesign especially the interior.  Navigation system very user friendly. Audi A6 This car is one of the most enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven.  The lines and features are fabulous.  Options galore. Excellence in Elegance The A6 is the best car I\\'ve ever owned... not necessarily the best I\\'ve ever driven. But then, a DeTamasso Pantera is not exactly your every day car.  Nevertheless, the A6 delivers superior performance, comfort and safety.  And, it\\'s a great looking car, while not the most pricey of the luxury sedans. The electronics display does require some investment of time to fully understand.  Also, I had some minor seat problems the dealer rectified only after 3 trips. However, the dealer service was courteous and, overall, the A6 is a great car. I\\'m a proud owner. A6 vs 530i My 2006 BMW 530i was totaled in an accident after 3 months and since it took 6 weeks for the repair shop to get BMW to determine it was totaled, I elected to go with an A6.  Both are great cars.  The 530 has better low end torque and is quicker off the line.  Both have a great road feel.  The Audi Navigation and computer are much more user friendly.  As far as gas mileage, I was getting 20+ with the BMW.  I\\'m getting similar mileage with the Audi although my last tank was around 18 - 19.   Nice step up from A4 Having owned the A4 previously, I prefered the sportiness of a smaller car. But the need for more room was overpowering. This is a good trade-off. It is not as nimble as the A4, but it is responsive and for a car this size gets around quite well. Best in Class I just hit my 1000th mile on my new A6. Being a 6 time former BMW owner, I have to say I am darn happy I chose my A6 vs. the 530 I first test drove. This car is awesome in rain, absolutely gorgeous and quiet inside and drives beautifully. Sure it\\'s not quite as tight in at the wheel, in fact, it\\'s a bit Lexus like.. requiring nearly no input to drive, however, the comfort, quality of the interior and awesome braking more than make up for it.  Also.. it feels like my 02 740 IL inside with massive rear legroom vs. the ever so tight 5 series which was a major factor in this particular decision.  The useability of the MMI system/NAV etc.. it the most intuitive of every car I\\'ve driven as well I\\'m in Luv! I finally got the call the my order was in. Picked it on Saturday. All I can say is \"I\\'m in Luv!\"  It was sitting in delivery as I pulled into the dealership. I almost ran into something as it caught my eye. The color was worth the wait. I live on the east cost about an hour from Atlantic City. Went down that night and it felt like I was gliding on the road. What a wonderful drive. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t get the 4.2...I\\'m sure I would accumulate many speeding ticket\\'s if I had. I was doing 80 and it felt like 55/60.  Also, I\\'ve heard mixed reviews regarding the MMI system being difficult...I do not find it difficult at all.  Look forward to driving again I typically prefer Japanese upscale cars for reliability but was wowed by the interior and exterior design.  Wife had an A6 many years ago that had its compliment of electrical and oil burning problems which kept me away until now.  Have been extremely pleased with the cars performance, handling and comfort over the past 4 months. Fun to drive, fun to own This car stood out in the dealer showroom. Blue with ameratto interior. But it not only looks great, the fit, and finish is \"Audi usual\" great. They thought of just about everything. Driving it is a pleasure. The low end torque off from start, is slugglish, but its acceptable. Fuel economy so far has been acceptable for this type of car. I look forward to a great ownership experience. Dead Solid Near Perfect Only 1200 miles, so far, but a beautiful ride.  Had a 1998 A6 for 3 years on lease with no problems.  It just wasn\\'t powerful enough.  The new motor takes care of that problem.  The build quality is simply fantastic.  Paint finish and interior quality are excellent.  The biggest thing is the Quattro - it\\'s like driving on rails, very confidence inspiring.  Economy is good for a vehicle of this type.  The MMI is slightly confusing at times but, once you use it for awhile, it becomes more intuitive.  We have almost all the options (Technology, etc.), but the heated steering wheel (which just wasn\\'t in stock.)  The interior lighting, switches, etc., is simply best in class.  We love the car. love this car Runs great and is fun to drive  Buy the all weather Mats .. look good and work better than cloth mats   The shortest 5 hour drive of my life I bought my A6 after extensive web, book and test drive research.  I am a big guy, who has always bought cars that fit my appetite for sport and luxury.  The A6 has exceeded my expectations and after Mercedes and BMW and Lexus were given their fair shot amongst others, I bought my 4.2 while visiting my brother in law who lives 5 hours away. By the time I arrived home I had mastered the MMI, Satellite Radio and Navigation systems, and was let down when I actually was at the end of my trip.  I have never found a car so ergonomically sound, practical, powerful, and energizing, while pampering you all at the same time. Nice car I have owned many Audis from the A8 on down.  This is my 3rd A6.  They have always been nice to look at but were short on driving dynamics.  This car drives like no other audi I have driven, including the current S4.  It is a large car that drives like a BMW.  The steering/road feel is all there.  I have had no problems so far and have very little to complain about.  There are always things that disappoint like making the trip computer at option on a 49k sticker car. This has always been an Audi hallmark.  My 85 4000Q had it standard.  Other than the little stuff, this car rocks.  jm Fantastic Car This is my second Audi.  The new A6 is outstanding and fun to drive.  So far it has been picture perfect.   tight ride This Audi is refined yet subtle.  Those around you cannot appreciate this cars ability.  Wolf in sheeps sheet metal. This is a machine! I researched and drove the Mercedes E500 and the BMW 530xi before I drove this car. I went right back to the showroom and bought it - never looked back at the MB or BMW. The ride, power, handling, and technology in this car is head and shoulders above them. I get compliments from people that see this car at night! A real head turner. I love the MMI. The power in this 4.2 reminds me of my 2001 Corvette - this car may keep the Vette sitting in the garage under it\\'s cover. Fun with Luxury This is my first Audi after owning several Lexus\\'. I must say that the quality and performance is far supeior to what I have experienced with other brands. This car is fun, fun, fur to drive with all the luxury included. 2006 A6 Avant Impressions I\\'ve had the 2006 Avant for 3 months now and it\\'s a great car. I live in the Northeast and the car sticks to bad road conditions like glue. Styling is more masculine than past Audi models, but the interior is top-rate. I spent months deciding between the BMW 530xi wagon and the A6 and did back-to-back test drives three times. The Audi is in a different class than the BMW. The 6cyl is plenty powerful, and my last car was a 2001 BMW 740il. Gas mileage has been stellar, and the MMI interface is far more user friendly than the BMW. For Options I suggest the sport seats, technology package, and the navigation. I had to get the 17\" wheels and the sport shifters but would have preferred 18\" tires Top notch Picked up my 3.2 A6 last week and my oh my, is this a beautiful car or what! Mine is fully loaded with all options and the S-Line package. The interior is top notch quality. Performance is very good especially in sports mode, the car feels very preppy and fun to drive. All in all, 10 out of 10 overall. Saved My Life The way this vehicle was constructed saved me from even a scratch in a major accident. The only drawback for buying an Audi, as some of you may already know, is the delay in getting parts. Be prepared to wait an extraordinary amount of time (it took 3 months to get in the navigation system I ordered in June) to get parts. They are beautiful cars, constructed to take care of the passengers in an accident. Sporty ride yet smooth touring performance.  I like it !! Put the shifter Sport mode or use Tiptronic and you can get rid of that 3rd car you got to have fun.  AWD is spectacular, not just in snow and rain but at all times.  I could not be more pleased by the manufacturer and the dealer that sold it and services it.  The value and pleasure are immense. Try it, you\\'ll like it, great car This is my 2nd A6. My 1st. one was great up to 40k then it started to have minor problems, so I leased the new one for 36 mos. This is a great car and fun to drive, handles well and has awesome pick-up. Interior is beautiful and has a lot of great standard equip. except for one item that was standard on my old A6 but not on the new A6, the Trip Computer. All of the auto research web sites say it is standard, but they are incorrect. I found that out the hard way after I bought the car. You have to spend $1000\\'s in packages to get it. For some very strange reason Audi discontinued it as standard for 2006 A6. Even the owners manual has instructions on how to use it. Great Decision I would have given 10s across the board, but haven\\'t driven the A6 in winter conditions yet. This is a car I look forward to driving for many reasons. I love the sport mode and watching the RPMs rev. The gadgets are great and comfort is superb.  The A6 is the better A8 Just acquired this great A6 3.2L. The A6 Sedan offers all the great features of the A8. But it has the bigger and more flexible trunk. It combines luxury and utility. It\\'s definitely the better A8 for 20.000 USD less.  STELLAR DESIGN, NOT RUN OF THE MILL I\\'ve recently switched from my 3rd BMW to the Audi.  The all wheel drive Quattro system makes me wonder how I ever drove the rear wheel drive BMW.  The performance of the Audi\\'s Quattro System, even in dry conditions, gives the driver complete control in sport driving conditions.  I truly feel the quality and fit and finish are much better.  BMW\\'s new 5 and 7\\'s awkward design and cumbersom interiors really turned me off.  The MMI system is also very convenient and easy to use unlike the I Drive which seems to only complicate things.   the bomb Love it, I really love this car the style, the ride and the overall performance of the car sets it apart from all other car in it\\'s price range.  This car could cost far more and be well worth it.  2005 A6 3.2 Q Extremely well built and thought out vehicle.  The interior is cutting edge, yet refined and clean.  The MMI system is extremely intuitive, I learned its operation in a couple hours.  Very good power, it will push you back in your seat.   I rarely see these vehicles on the road, which is a good thing. Audi is rated 8 out of 37 in quality this year from JD Power and Associates, and I agree.   A6 review My second A6.  Mix of great things and some annoyances.  Biggest issue is steering wheel which doesn\\'t align straight when car is going straight.  Not fixable because of the design and quite irritating when driving.  Lower driver\\'s seat cushion doesn\\'t move much so for some average size folks not a comfortable position.  Also the impeccable interior design of the last generation A6 design drops with absence of single CD capability, usable second cup holder and airbag and door lock lights that are very bright. Goodies two: Navigation is very easy.  Automatic electronic key is far nicer than you would guess.  Great trunk with quality folding seats. LOVE my A6 After being in american made vehicles for over a decade, I am in love with my A6.  My wife\\'s car is grossly under her leased mileage, but I still find myself taking my new A6 everywhere we go.  I drive a lot for work, and I am actually in better moods at work and after work due to the fun driving experience of the A6.  I recommend this car to anyone looking for a mid-size sedan. Excellent Value Excellent value for the amount of car you get. Very sleek elegant styling compared to the boxy looks of the Mercedes Benz and BMW equivalents. Interior is roomy and comfortable especially for those that are taller than average. First time I had a car where I do not have to push the seat all the back for leg comfort. Get the Sport Package as the car performs and responds much better with it and is more than reasonably priced for what you get in return. Would buy again I wish a little bit more on the take-off, other than that I love this car it\\'s a lot of fun to drive.  I also like being able to switch between auto and manual shifting. Great car except... I test drove everything in the A6\\'s class.  The Audi is heads and shoulders above the competition.  The interior feels like someone actually thought about it, the suspension is comfortable at any speed yet can still be tossed around without any complaint.  The quattro still amazes me everyday.  My only complaint is with all the warning noises this car has, in particular the seatbelt \\'ding\\' and the low fuel warning.  I know we should all wear our seatbelts, but come on, I don\\'t need the car to constantly tell me.  The low fuel warning scares the bejesus out of me everytime, I think just a light would be sufficient.  overall excellence This is second Audi. First was 10 years ago. That car felt like it was trying to be \"American\".  The new A6 is German in all of its details.  Steering is quick, cornering is flat, braking is straight and sure, ride is firm and engine response is strong and quiet.  The A6 does everything it should do with a high level of confidence and satisfaction.  Overall, a very satisfactory solid hunk of automobile. Great Car  I have owned my A6 for 9 months. Great car, handles beautifully even in snow.  Fun car to drive and a beautiful design and excellent workmanship. No mechanical problems. I will buy my wife a new A4 based on my experiences with the A6. Audi A6 Review The nicest ride I have experienced. Audi A6 - Best Luxury Sports Sedan Today Without a doubt, the Audi A6 is the luxury sports sedan that achieves the most compelling balance between driving experience, luxury, utility, safety and aesthetics. Every component of the vehicle--from the well thought out and purposeful controls and convenience features (Audi\\'s MMI runs circles around BMW\\'s iDrive and Mercedes\\' COMMAND) to the cavernous trunk, buttery-smooth engine and transmission, tastefully appointed interior and distinctive exterior design--works together to achieve a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. I looked at the BMW 5- series, the MB E-class, the Lexus GS and the Acura RL and when the dust settled, the A6 had the clear advantage--the new benchmark! Awesome A-6 After over 20 years with BMW, the beauty of the A-6 won us over. Wow, what an awesome car! Never have we seen a better interior, at any price. And that Quattro drive! What more could one want? Then to hear the recent crash test ratings. The highest you can get, front and side. What a BONUS! Run out and buy one..... Best Ever, I\\'ve had a lot Traded in my A4 Cabriolet for some extra space and luxury and am not disappointed.  Economy is much better than expected and if driven conservatively will get over 23 MPG.  Have a diesel in europe, wish they would send them here.  Luxury and interior design are unequalled, ride is smooth, great handling and braking.  This has got to be one of the best Audis ever.  I am in my 50\\'s and at last count have owned over 25 cars, sports, SUV, Vans, wagons and Muscle cars, almost every model, This is by far the best . Worth the wait I had to wait several months for my 06 A6 S-Line to arrive as 4.2 S-lines are few and far between.  This is my 3rd Audi and this new A6 has exceeded my expectations.  I used to drive an E500, but this is so much better.  The first response from the accelerator is a bit soft.  But, if you step on it - it moves!  Build quality and interior design and technology are the best in ANY car I have seen. Forget the Competition After owning 3 BMWs which by the way I loved and driving numerous sports cars I still can not believe the performance of my my new Audi a6 4.2, I opted for the sport package with the 18 inch rims and P-Zero tires and lowered suspension, this car handles like it\\'s on rails, I cut three lanes at over 100 mph and don\\'t hear so much as a whisper from the car, at 125 mph the car feels safe, solid and extremely quiet for this speed, I constantly drive the car in S mode so my gas mileage suffers, small price to pay for an adrenaline rush, next week I\\'m having the 130 mph limiter removed and would be disappointed if I dont reach a solid 160 mph, overall this piece of machinery is incredible. Not Audi\\'s best work. First, lets just get the bad stuff out of the way.  I have been a mechanic for 30 years, and there are some things that were done with this car that makes me think it was designed and assembled by retards.  The compartment aft of the engine (where battery is) fills up to the top with water and i guess Audi never thought that anything like leaves or dirt might just get in a clog those microscopic drain hole in that compartment, had the problem 3 times, finally got pissed to the point taking a chance and drilling a 1\" hole in the bottom  of it. That also causes water in the carpet area, which then leads to expensive electronic modules stopping to work, which are located under where your feet rest in the front seats.  STUPID!!! ----- Next, they built the exhaust so the heat shields fail prematurely and they attached the exhaust hangers which are spot welded to the heat shields!  So that falls off the car and gets wrecked resulting in a $1,700 bill.  DUMB!!!   ------Next, Their bodywork for a German car appears to be way below BMW.  This car had surface rust all over the typical areas at 124k miles, that is unacceptable for a car built in 1999.  -----Front Suspension?  Parts are GARBAGE, wears out very quickly, every inspection it needs a new upper front or rear A-arm.   Next--- LCD information screen in dash, POS!  Also fails prematurely on most of these cars. I could have bought a Corolla and got better in the engineering department ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Good-: Handles well, accelerates good, brakes are just okay for this weight car. A6 forever Like an old pair of shoes you love. This car has a casual elegance to it. Pleasant Surprise Lots of bang for the buck in mechanics, body, interior and creature comforts - and they all have worked with no trouble. No exterior noise at any speed, some gear noise at 35-45, handles precisely, always starts first time. Auto leveler works for any weight - up to cement bags and block filling rear. Designed and works for smooth driving; gas efficiency is great for heavy car when alert to traffic lights and with light foot on brake and gas pedals. Cruises without effort, and rpm to spare for passing.  Roof rack needs better connectors/tie-down points + paint protection. Headlight washers/rear wiper and defroster all still work well. Stable in ice/snow/slush/mud.  Wife loves heated seats! Best possible winter car I just purchased one of these last summer after my 1988 Jeep stopped working, and this has been a far superior Colorado winter vehicle than anything I\\'ve ever driven in the past, including an Explorer and my Jeep. The bad news: I have spent almost $4,000 in repairs since I bought it in June. The coolant fan tends to burn out on these around 90k miles, and I purchased mine at 93k. However it is now a solid car that I should at least get another 60- 70k miles out of. Don\\'t purchase these if you can\\'t afford the repair bills. However, if you can, these are some of the best. Winter safety was my primary reason for making this purchase, and it easily outperforms local favorites Subaru and Volvo. Costly to Own Read before buying. I bought the car for dependability and I have been in the shop more than anyone I know with what people consider lesser cars. I have replaced all ball joints (twice over) and I do not drive hard, replaced rotors, breaks. The heated, tinted mirrors are peeling on one side. Some interior items just broke at a touch. Went thru a period of the car starting randomly, currently revisiting that problem again. The dash diplay fades out. The car had low mileage when I purchased it and had been maintained by the previous owners. Thanking myself for not selling my old car as it has been there for me when the Audi fails. I do not think I would buy one again, not impressed. Buyer beware Styling and roominess were my main considerations in buying this car. Others I considered were Volvo V70, MB 320/420 wgn, mazada 6 wgn. On test drive alone I prefered the Audi.  AWD and long list of options were what clinched it. I thought I was stealing this thing at $8,500 two years ago with 73k miles on it.  Similar MB or Volvo were well above $10,000. I soon leared that there are a long list of \"common\" problems with this vehicle.  Off and on working of electronics is the most frustrating,of course everything worked when I test drove it. Other problems I\\'ve experienced are: ABS controller $500, upper control arms/tie rod replacement $1,000, oil leak $? Good luck when buying this car Owner\\'s nightmare: mechanic\\'s dream. Bought it with 68K miles two years ago. Also considered Volvo, Benz, and BMW.   We liked the styling, test drive, features. Though it drove well/handled well in snow (rural NE PA), it experienced (beyone regular service) monthly mechanical difficulties involving engine (including replacement), genuine replacement parts, transmission, suspension, possessed/failing accessories, LED display, & electronics-based issues.  In two years, purchased 3 sets of tires (including one set of Blizzaks), numerous modules, replacement engine, other engine parts. Spent average of $500/mo on repairs during ownership. Just traded it with 130,000 miles. Wife and I literally cried in joy after doing so.   One of the best wagons! Purchased with 79K now has 98k.The only major replacement was the front suspension.This wears out prematurely but there was a recall on this.However it does not last typically as long as other cars\\',it is aluminum.Aftermarket suspension is better than OE. Acceleration is adequate but once on the highway maintains speed well.Maybe gearing meant for Autobahn and not 0- 60 times. Very comfortable. Driving habits will determine fuel consumption.Heavy right lead footed acceleration will move the weighty Avant, but will result in average/poor fuel consumption. Handling very good with 17\" wheels.Heated steering whell and seats.Bose stereo and 6 CD changer handy. Buying decision was based on safety. 1999 Audi Wagon My wife got the car 10 days ago and she loves it! Great all around family car Make sure you do your homework.  Buy an Audi that has been well maintained, and do regular maintenance.  No one can believe that the car is 8 years old w/ over 100k on her.  She looks and drives like new.  We have had to do the control arms (11 piece set w/ tie rods were $400 + $250 labor), also put in Koni FDS shocks and the car rides BETTER than new.  We have slowly been changing all the  fluids (tranny, differentials) and this makes a BIG difference.  We also switched to synthetic (0/40 Mobil1) oil, again with very good results.  Audi comfort and interior quality is second to none. Shocking good Bought this 7 year old car on ebay 3 weeks ago. I did a lot of research including reading many of the reviews right here and I can tell you that so far, after just 3 weeks and just a completed 2000 mile trip, I am thrilled with this car.  Bought in Philly and immediately drove up to mid coast Maine, almost 500 miles, this car drove effortlessly and was tight.  The car had 106,000K on it and now has over 108 in just 3 weeks. The car was a one-owner and serviced at audi regularly, I checked, including the timing belt/water pump change ($1800 approx) at 95K. I was hoping that service had been performed but did not find out until after i purchased the car. So far so good, I am very happpy At the Crossroads This car has fit the bill..mostly. We wanted a wagon for hauling stuff, AWD for New England weather, the comfort and quality of luxury car, and priced less that $25k (we bought used). We make regular cross NE trips with confidence and car leaves us refreshed, not tired.  Four years later we\\'re untimely faced with the cost of new brakes, new tires, expensive timing belt change, oil leak fix, repainting front bumper, and regular maintenance all at the same time.   As with all VW/Audis I have owned they are plagued by electrical inconsistencies that we learn to live to enjoy the \\'german\\' driving experience. So, the question is do invest $3K to fix and keep it or get $6-7k, maybe, on trade.  1999 audi avant--my 6th audi--best yet! great all-around, all-season automobile...comfort and poise whether driving through southern wyoming mountain passes, or down I-25 to the denver airport (unless you lose key going thru customs and have to rent a car plus shell out $187 for new laser- cut key)...overall a great automobile that I still enjoy driving... Audi Lack of Assurance Car has been great with minor problems  Awesome A6 Rock solid car, even after 50,000 \\rmiles.  Every aspect of this car is \\rwell engineered and manufactured.  \\rAudi dealer treats me with respect and \\rtakes excellent care of the care.  \\rWarranty issues dealt with promptly \\rand efficiently. The best sportscar wagon! This vehicle has offered nothing but  Too Unreliable Overpriced & very sluggish from lights, \\rroars like a bull when driven hard. \\rPoor quality interior (Rear cargo cover \\r& first aid kit door broken, illegible \\rradio display when cold, fading dash \\rdisplay when hot) Oil Leak, burns a lot \\rof oil, fuel sensors replaced 3 times, \\rXenon light replaced due to moisture \\rabsorption, Intermittent rear cargo \\rlight operation (dealer unable to find \\rcause) Safe car, handles well but well \\rbelow par performance for a car of this \\rprice. The quality of these cars is hit \\rand miss. If you get a good one you\\'re \\rlucky, if you get a lemon like me, \\ryou\\'ll never buy another. Car was be \\rreturned to bank after 2 years lease \\r(14000 miles). Beautiful Wagon Without a doubt, the Audi A6 Avant is a \\rstunning car to look at. Although I \\rdidn\\'t have many problems with it, it \\ris now out of warranty and I\\'m getting \\rrid of it before it attacks me in the \\rwallet.  Too expensive to fix and I \\rfear a transmission problem developing \\r(\"clunking\" at 70+ mph.  Have had to \\rreplace the tires twice in 3 years and \\rI keep losing trim pieces: cupholders \\rfall apart and the cover on the \\rheadlight washers have fallen of, while \\rdriving, 4 times and I\\'ve had to \\rreplace them.  It is a lovely vehicle, \\rbut don\\'t keep it past it\\'s warranty! A6 Lovely but risky I love my A6 Avant in most repects.  I \\rcan throw my two dogs in the back and\\rgo camping or enjoy the twisty canyon \\rroads with the steptronic transmission.\\rI love the interior, the sound system, \\rthe looks and the refined engine\\r/transmission combination.  All I \\rask is that the car hold together over \\rthe long term.  I bought it with 36,000\\rmiles and 2,000 miles later it is in \\rthe shop having a clunk in the front \\rsuspension looked at.  The brakes are\\ralso being scrutinized as they have \\rbegun to squeal.  The air conditioning \\rworks well but sounds like a giant \\rvacuum cleaner.  I recommend the \\rAudiworld website. The worst car ever created For the $40k this car cost, it should be\\rreliable.  It\\'s not.  16 major problems\\rand 22 minor ones in 4 years.  I wish\\rI\\'d bought two $20k Mazdas instead. \\rI\\'ll never buy another Audi.  EVER. Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop Relatively pain-free; an \\rabsolute joy to drive. Originally a \\rSoCal car, now in Michigan, the quattro \\rhas impressed. Fuel \\rsending unit recall early on, expecting \\rmore trouble; never had it. Only \\rother odd thing: Rear pads lasting \\rabout half as long as fronts and \\rthe rotors not being \"turn-able\" \\rdespite catching pads early. My Jetta \\rVR6 is MUCH more problematic; Doubt \\rI\\'ll buy A6 after lease is up 7/03 just \\rfor fear of what I\\'ll be up for. Oh, \\ryeah. Leatherette interior, no seat \\rheaters, no BOSE, no moonroof makes \\rthis car\\'s residual a joke (but \\roriginal deal bettered V70). Pleasantly surprised My wife really wanted this car -- I had \\rfavored a purchase of a Volvo.  Now, we \\rboth enjoy the vehicle and find it \\rincredibly comfortable, no hassle to \\rmaintain, and good to look at.  It is \\rtrue \"German engineering\" at its best \\rin a reasonably priced package. 4 years and still impressed I\\'ve owned this car since new in 1999.  It has sucked my bank account dry... I bought my car with 52K. It\\'s been in \\rthe shop on the average of once/month \\rsince I\\'ve had it for the past year. It \\rcosts a fortune to maintain. I\\'ve had \\rto replace the control panel computer, \\rthe brakes, the automatic window guide, \\rthe water pump, the speaker wiring for \\rthe phone, the passenger seat controls. \\rI had to change a tire yesterday. The \\rjack is worthless in the snow. Its \\rcantilevered design would not work on a \\rsnowy, but hard surface. I\\'m hoping to \\rtrade it in for a Subaru. I wish I had \\rgotten one to begin with, but I was \\rtotally seduced by the comfort and \\rquiet of the Audi.  Perfect Means Of Travel I\\'ve had this car for a month now and \\rit still impresses me with the \\rperformance and touches that make \\rdriving it such a pleasure. The prior \\rowner maintained it very well and it \\rdoesn\\'t look or feel like a four year \\rold machine.  I\\'m looking forward to a \\rgood dump of snow to really put it \\rthrough it\\'s paces.  It would have \\rbeen perfect if it had a standard \\rtransmission, but on balance, the \\roverall package more than makes up for \\rit. German for Quality Have only had the Avant 2.8 for a \\rmonth, bought used with 32k. Audi \\rbuilds a quality product that is \\rextremely solid and well designed.  I \\rhave to agree with previous reviews \\rthat it feels slightly underpowered \\rwhile in a partial throttle \\racceleration from a standing stop, but \\rif you get on it, the 200 ponies are \\rdefinitely there.  When the engine is \\rcold, the trans does not want to shift \\rat the normal times, but the tiptronic \\rcures that.  The car is a joy to drive \\ron the highway - smooth as silk and \\rgood handling.  I also prefer the \\rtiptronic shifting in the mountains.  \\rThe car conrner like it on rails, \\rdoesn\\'t feel at all like a wagon. A6_Avant We chose the A6_Avant knowing about \\rits relatively poor gas mileage and \\rits under-powered engine. These were \\racceptable given the car\\x92s smooth, \\rquiet ride, AWD capability, and \\rstyling. We did not expect an unending \\rseries of repairs and recalls, though. \\rWe had problems with the fuel-sending \\runit, the instrument display cluster, \\rthe rear-window lockout control, the \\rrear speakers, the radio/CD player \\r(2X), the windshield washer sensor, an \\rengine hose, and front window clips. \\rUnfortunately, these problems seem \\rcommon for Audi, and I would not \\rrecommend the A6_Avant. audi best handling car with fantastic  Another nice Audi quattro Wagon Our experience has been typical of our \\rprevious VW and Audi vehicles.  The \\rmajor stuff (engine, transmission, \\rquattro, etc.) is bulletproof.  The \\rcar\\'s structure is very solid, and \\rpossesses that wonderful German feel \\rwhen driving or simply closing the \\rhefty door.  It is the little things, \\rsuch as broken switches and failed \\relectronic modules, that will drive you \\rcrazy (as they deplete your bank \\raccount).  Dealer network is \\rinconsistent, ranging from \"we\\'re an \\r(affluent) Porsche/Audi luxury car \\rdealer, and intend to treat you \\raccordingly,\" to \"our other franchises \\rare VW and Honda, and we plan to handle \\ryou in a similar less-than-refined \\rmanner.\" A6 Avant We like the car but it is slightly \\runderpowered and too many little \\rthings go wrong i.e., spearkers(one \\rfront one rear). The brakes make too \\rmuch dust and the climate control will \\rallow the temp to get too hot on cold \\rdays before getting the correct temp. \\rThe fuel pump went out over night so \\rthe car had to be towed in to be \\rrepaired. The cost of the pump was \\r$350 and was not in stock. Great car, expensive to maintain The Audi A6 wagon has been a pleasure \\rto drive.  It\\'s single drawback is a \\rgrossly underpowered engine.  Although \\rthe numbers tell you that you can do 0-\\r60 in 9.5 sec., it sure doesn\\'t feel \\rit.  The car is solid and heavy, which \\rmay contribute to the slow sensation.  \\rMy biggest dissapointment was a $1,200 \\rrepair bill three months after the 36 \\rmonth warrantee expired.  All of the \\rrepairs were for items that had \\rdeclined overtime and appear to be not \\runexpected in Audi\\'s (air conditioner \\rsensor / controller failure, ignition \\rkey mechanism failure.  Maybe the new \\r48 month warrantee will catch these \\rthings, if not, enjoy he car but watch \\rout. Small problems drive me crazy! Great ride...but spent too much time in  A6 Avant Very stylish and comfortable and quiet cruiser.  Last car was a Land Rover Discovery.  This is a much better car to travel in.   I\\'ve had it into service too many times -- new power steering pump, and a few electrical glitches.  I\\'m fortunate it is under warranty. A great looking Wagon I loved the car but found that it lacked in the initial pick-up but once it got going, it WENT. The newer models have more pick-up. The hardware is a bit flimsy but Audi has been very good about replacing items.eg:rear drink holder face plates and the latch on the trunk emergency pack (this has broken several times just by the routine daily opening and closing of the trunk.) better than most of the best this car can really get it!it seems to get smoother the faster you go 130 is smooth and the awd quattro grips it and gets it all four sticking and getting it. i love this car better than most bmws i love my a6 16 Years Strong We bought our 99 A6 Quattro in 2002 when it came off lease. I decided to buy Audi for its reputable Quattro performance and living in New Hampshire, the winters can be brutal. We still have this vehicle! It has had all the normal and expected maintenance done to it with a hefty price tag for all of it, but it is what you can expect with Audi as you would with BMW or Mercedes. Recently the last major job I had done was four new spring coils, joints and tie rod. It was done at a \"bargain\" of $3300. I decided to have it done only because I was impressed it took 16 years for the suspension to finally fail a state inspection. Also, these cars never rust. 133,000mi and plan for another 200,000. 1999 A6 quattro Very good vehicle, but the repairs are expensive as the miles add up. I\\x92ve had my A6 quattro for a little over 8 years & 150.000 miles. I bought the car with 47,000 miles & no problems until 98,000, then the serpentine belt tensioner broke. I went ahead a serviced the timing belt, water pump, etc. Later bought shocks from Germanautoparts.com & they are vastly superior to stock. The vehicle feels rock solid on the road and tracks straight with minimal input from the driver. Find yourself an Indie mechanic. I go to my local VW dealer for oil changes & some labor. VW parts are cheaper than Audi parts (SAME PARTS). Also, labor charge at Audi dealership is twice what VW dealer charges\\x85Go figure. Germany\\'s best production We love our A6. I purchased it used back in 2002 and still own it 10 years later. We have only had minor problems with it such as the tiptronic system not working (easy computer chip fix), replaced the water pump and had a smoke causing oil leak fixed. The Quattro AWD system cuts through the snow-packed New Hampshire and Maine roads like a knife through butter. We also have a Mercedes E320 4MATIC and by far, the Audi Quattro AWD system leaves the Mercedes buried (literally). We also found the front and rear seats more comfortable than MB, BMW. While the Quattro system does take from the acceleration a little bit, the car does respond quickly with a \"press back in the seat\" feel at high speed My First Car My Audi A6 was a great first car. It\\'s a smooth, quiet ride. I got it used at 169,000 miles and it smoked sometimes after reaching it\\'s destination. Also the car had problems with leaking oil. Mechanics commented that it looks like a tsunami down there! Both problems did not seem to effect the car from getting around. The oil problems do seem to be a common issue with the A6 though because after this audi was beat up by a deer, I looked into another audi A6 but its oil problems were even worse than the first. Love it! Bought it this year and enjoy every minute of driving it consider it like an old friend that you trust your life to does use a lil bit of oil (151k) but the Audi dealer said it was natural. This is my 3rd Audi owned an A4 and 100. Quattro is great especially in the curves (which is only matched by my 944) The car is quick when I need it and I like the quality of the interior of using metal and real wood veneer whereas most cars have cheap fake wood. The only problem I found is that it gets very hot without the A/C on so hot that it fogs up my glasses in the summer Excellent vehicle This is my second 1999 Audi A6. Both cars have proven to be very durable. Each car had the same minor issues, ie: broken mirror adjust switch, et cetera. (easy fixes) The build quality is top level, classic styling , decent power, and unstoppable in any weather. I have done most of the things people complain about in their reviews, but they don\\'t seem to understand its routine maintenance, control arms, timing belts, and others. That being said, if you maintain a car like this properly, it will last a very long time. Owning a high end German car is a commitment (but ultimately very rewarding) , if your not willing to pay, get a generic Japanese luxury car, what a tool you\\'ll look. Winter Use Only High maintenance vehicle that is a great winter car, unfortunately the consistent repair issues take away from an otherwise great vehicle.  Wife uses car in the winter during snow season and works great for that but the reliability issues do take away from the car.  With only 114k miles on it these types of issues should not happen. It\\'s pretty...pretty expensive to own I loved everything about this car, except for the true cost of ownership. I owned it for two years, and put $1000/year into maintenance. Water pump $600, Power window $400, etc. It had tons of room in cab and trunk, and lots of quality and style. Watch out for the stereo, though. If you change the battery, or there\\'s a short, the stero locks up and you need a code to unlock it - which\\'ll cost you $75 if you don\\'t know it. And if you want to upgrade the stereo, you have to replace EVERYTHING (deck, speakers, wires). I loved it as long as I could afford it, but I won\\'t buy another. P.S. make sure to get an owner\\'s manual What a piece of junk! Looks ok, handles ok... it is gutless off the line. Endless problems, the Yugo I had in college had better reliability. Leaks oil - dealer can\\'t find the cause, engine smokes from oil leak. Eats brake pads and tires. This is NOT a supposed luxury car... I now know its a step or two below most American made cars and nowhere near a well built, reliable Japanese vehicle. My ego said buy it, my brain said,\"NO\" - well the ego won and now I\\'m paying. What a piece of junk! You fooled me once never again... back to the 4Runner. Which was only good to me. Beautiful car, wish it was more reliable I\\'ve had this car for 1.5 years and have had to replace the timing belt, control arm, serpentine belt & transmission, as well as a few smaller things. The car came to a dead stop while driving it. Thankfully I was on the exit ramp and not still on the highway doing 70mph. My kids & I would have been in a serious accident. Disappointed that at 110K all of these things went wrong. I have a 15yr old Jeep Grand Cherokee at 180k that didn\\'t have nearly as many problems. Every time I see a car I really like a lot, it\\'s always an Audi, but for the price, I want a car that\\'s much more dependable. Selling the Audi & buying an Acura! Skeerd I\\'m scared! Bought it used (and boy was it ever!)100k. So far, had to replace plugs and wires. My sunroof got stuck in the open position and my driver\\'s side window has a mind of its own. Also, the cup holder in the center console is stuck in up position. I am terrified that I trusted German engineering for a 2nd time (had VWJetta). I am of German decent, which makes me embarassed to say the least about this car! Hope you have a lot of money for repairs. I feel like I had sucker written over my face! Junk!  Old Audi A6 - 1999 Shines with 226000 mi I was very happy to find this car priced at $4400.00.  I was expecting the worst when I traveled across the state to take delivery.  I found out the original owner drove the car every day from Bellevue to Olympia.  It was serviced on schedule and oil changed every 3000 miles.  This car is near perfect and even with 226000 miles, it feels like new and I would not hesitate to drive it across the US without fear of any problems.  I like this car much more than our 2002 325ci.  We are thinking of unloading our BMW and buying a couple more of this type of car.  Cheers! Audi: Never Follow A6 was previously owned by close relatives, we took over few years ago. They were the original owners. They replaced the fuel pump and other components.  We paid $700 for service. Since then the car has literally fallen apart. From 108k -117k miles, the driveshaft messed up, the transmission needs to be replaced, sparkplug wires are corroded, vacuum hoses are clogged, interior is falling apart, door handles and everything. Dealer wants $6300 for new trans. Even at discount, trans would still be worth more than the car. Car has poor resale value. I despise this car, I wish we never took over it. We took care of it, but it didn\\'t help. Audi\\'s slogan is \"Never Follow\", trust me ... I wont! Best luxury car for in its price I really like the car. It is really nice when you are tired from work it gives you comfort and relaxation you need. I recommend it. Classy ride I read other reviews and was wary of this model, but the test drive swayed me.  This does not drive like a 3800 lb car.  Coming from a BMW 525, I felt some difference, but not that much. Acceleration isn\\'t blazing and gas mileage is disappointing, but the interior is top-notch.  No mechanical problems yet after 6,000 miles.  I am baffled how a windshield wiper fluid tank can spring a leak though.  Not as easy to get to 100 mph as the bimmer. Love the ride - hate cost of ownership Bought this car with 30K miles now have 88K.  The Quattro is wonderful in slick stuff (snow/ice/rain).  The seats are good (inc long trips), the car is roomy and has a decent Bose sound system (CD changer is in trunk).  Trunk is huge.  Rear seat offers plenty room for family of 4.  Maintenance is expensive ($$$$) and I can\\'t do any of it myself - always need specialty tools that are very costly.  Seems verything is $500- $1500 per visit.  Vehicle Info System fades, bumper rips off if you hit curb- stop, oil-transmission and differential fluids all leak.  Brakes don\\'t last, air pump fails, expensive suspension components.  Mediocre mileage (I average 22 mpg), tires don\\'t last.  Still like ride! You won\\'t be dissappointed, maybe! I sold cars for many years and owned lots of vehicles.  I decided that I wanted an Audi cause of the space, smooth ride and AWD.  The Audi REALLY DELIVERED!!  I bought used cause I couldn\\'t afford new but I expected problems... but there weren\\'t many.  The headlight washer didn\\'t work, a few turn signals freaked out and the power lumbar doesn\\'t work either but the car runs great. I fixed a few things myself (no need to see a mechanic). The power is average but there are accessory parts to increase power. This vehicle is fun in the sun and great, reliable in the snow! I plan on owning it for many years to come!!  Not the German quality I was sold Big bucks lemon! Good ride and comfort, but has the same quality as my 1982 Pontiac 6000 . Back then even GM treated me better with problems then my dealer or contacting Audi direct. Dozens of small items broke, from washer covers, window switches (3xs times), front bumper cover, digital dashboard, front axel, tranny leaks, engine leaks (which they wouldn\\'t acknowledge  until the warranty was over) to final disgrace when the air bags failed to work when I totaled it. 4 days before I was to trade this nightmare in at a LOST - as the resale value also is horrible! Don\\'t believe the German quality myth. Not Hard Enough... UNBELIEVABLE IN SNOW!  Can be driven hard.  A quiet ride with tons of space, smooth brakes, and ample performance on the highway.  Bought with 57k in Dec\\'03 now has 77k.  Had to replace front end tie rods (2), CV boot (1), capshaft sensor (1), and normal wear-tear items.  Check engine light loves to say \"hi\".  Still wondering why little things break on this model - perhaps it\\'s just not hard enough for my driving. 1999 A6 Quatro Sedan My 1999 Audi A6 Sedan looks great anddrives great. I am glad that I purchased a 10yr / 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty though.  In four years I have already broken even on my premium for minor problems such as a heated steering wheel short, failed water pump, and window glide failure. I intend to keep car to the end of my warranty so I expect this is a case where it pays to get the extra insurance of bumper-bumper coverate with a $0 deductible. Worst car we have ever owned We purchased our 1999 Audi A6 with 3,000 miles on it (it was a dealer demo).  We drove it to 69,000 miles and had to make the following repairs: recalls; new fuel indicator 2x, blinker system, new radiator, waterpump, break discs 2x, front rocker arms. Some of this work was done under warrenty. At the last oil change ($62) we were told the transmission was leaking and it needed new torsion arms or something (again) The repair bill would be $1,700. I own a Toyota with 266,000 miles on it and never repaired any of the above. We retired the Audi and bought another Toyota. We saw similar Audis on Ebay, selling for $8,000! Audi A6 My 1999 Audi A6 is a pleasure. It is smooth, quiet, and handles well on winding roads. It is a bit sluggish from stops though. It has comfortable seating in the front and rear. It\\'s fun to drive in the snow. What a great looking car. High maintenance I bought a 1999 Audi A6 as certified vehicle with a two year warranty.  One month before the warranty went up, the water pump went out while I was doing 80 mph on a trip out of town.  The pump went out causing the engine to lock up and timing belt to come off.  After all was said and done (6 weeks later), the costs for repair was around $15,000.  I searched for warranties to extend the car from 60,000 miles to 100,000 miles but the cheapest I could find was $2,000.  I chose not to get one because I didn\\'t think I would spend that much in repairs.  Shortly after, the alternator went out costing $500. The whole front bumper and radiator has to be removed to get to it. It\\'s almost impossible to do repairs yourself and finding an independent repair shop is just as hard. Fix the electrics! My 1999 Audi A6 Sedan is fun to drive, but is slow off \\rthe line unless you use the tiptronic \\rshifter in first gear and stomp on it. \\rThe ride is soft for hard driving but \\rvery comfortable. The power options \\rcrap out and nit pick you too death. \\rBasically I like the car though. 1999 A6 Bought it with 18000 on it,now it\\'s \\r57000,no problem whatsoever .At first I \\rthought I stepped \"down\" after \\rdriving \\'93 740I for awhile.Perfomance \\rfelt kinda \"sluggish\".Then I realised \\rthan if U leave transmission in the 4 \\rposition there is not much difference \\rbetween either two.I switch in D only \\ron freeway,as soon as speedo shows 80.\\rWorks for me.I do most of the cars out \\rof holeshot.Torgue is not what the \\rnumber says,it\\'s how and when it \\rdelivered. nice \"looking\" car I love the interior.

I had to change the water pump \\rand thermostat $700 and the front \\rfight CV boot $200 in less than a \\ryear. Seems like there would be a \\rwarranty for this type of vehical but \\rnope 3 yr 40000. Looks Nice...Falls apart What a shame...I loved this car for \\rthe first two months...Thats when the \\rproblems started. I had it at the \\rdealership 5 times in 10 months. \\rAnyway, not reliable and Audi was \\roverall indifferent to the poor \\rquality. BEWARE Very good car except needs more HP it\\'s extremely fun to drive and handles carl Bought the car used with 52k, looks \\rgreat, love the interior, but poor \\rreliability. Within the last 10 months \\rI have had a transmission leak ($320), \\rengine oil leaks ($1,000), cruise \\rcontrol module ($525), transmission \\rrelay ($520) and the digital display \\ris fading. I plan on trading it in \\rnext week on a Nissan. German Disappointment Bought the car used -- still under Audi  One cool car After four years of owning my A6 I \\rstill love it and people still take \\rnotice.  Its understated, subtle and \\rclassy. The Black w/ Black interior \\rreally sets off the instrument panel.  \\rOn the interstate I can run as fast as \\rmy hear will stand it even though its a \\r6cyl.

Car is totally awesome and soooo \\rfun to drive.

Sure, I \\rwish it were thriftier, but that\\'s the \\rjoy of living in a congested city.  On \\rthe highway it does just fine; and \\rreally can fly too. Audi A6 2.8 I just purchased this vehicle with \\r39,900 miles on the clock and to date \\rno problems. The 2 year/100,000 mile \\rAudi Assured warranty sealed the deal \\rfor me.

Audi Lover An absolutely wonderful perfect, \\rrealiable, luxurious, powerful, dream \\rcar!!! 99audi a-6 review I drive my Audi A-6 100 miles each day  Third times still charming Wow my three year lease went by  \\rquickly, that\\'s how it goes when you \\rare having fun. Our A6 came with all \\rthe goodies. Quattro All wheel drive  \\rawesome, for trips to Tahoe in the snow \\rand around our hilly area when it \\rrains.  The stereo system with cd in-\\rdash and changer has been faultless &  \\rsounds superb. One minor repair, a leak \\rin a vacumn tube, quick in/out repair \\rby dealer.  With three small kids the \\rcar cleans up easy and looks like new \\rafterwards. No breaking of gadgets that \\rI have seen on other cars. This is our \\rfamily\\'s third Audi and we will buy \\ragain. Power/performance is good but \\rnot a speed sensation. Can\\'t ask for more My previous car was a BMW 325i (E36).  \\rI bought the A6 in \\'99 after we have \\rour second child to have more room. \\rComparing to the BMW, the A6, I has \\rmore room, comfort, luxury less \\rsportiness.  This is my third year \\rowning the car.  I\\'ve only experienced \\rone problem.  The steering got stiff.  \\rThat was fixed under warranty.  The \\rQuattro is tremendous.  I live in the \\rhilly area of Portland, Oregon, where \\rthey don\\'t salt or sand the roads when \\rit snows.  The A6 have no problem \\rmaking it through the hills, even with \\rstock tires.\\r My 3 year lease is up next month.  I \\rwill buy the A6 because I like it so \\rmuch.\\r Keep the car, loose the repairs We love the car, but the repairs, my \\rgod the repairs.  First off NEVER BUY \\rLEITH IMPORTS.  They will do nothing \\rfor you after you buy the car.  We \\rbought the car used, and had our guy \\rlook at it.  A few things that needed \\rfixing.  Audi Assured.  They never \\rfixed a few things.  They said they \\rdid.  We bought the car.  Soon later a \\rfew things didnt seem right.  They \\rsaid \"within manufactures specs.\" \\runture.  they lied.  One of the things \\rwas the head lights (Xeons) would \\rflicker, \"within manufactures specs.\", \\rthe whole headlight needed to be \\rrewired.  $2k if I remember correctly.  \\rNever trust Audi of Cary North Carolina. Good so far... So far, so good. Just purchased the 1999 A6 after a lot of research, and\\rmany test drives. Also seriously considered 5-series, C-Class MB,\\rES300. The A6 got the nod bc of the balance of comfort & performance.\\rInterior room & comforts is very good, and shifts smoothly bw gears. Handles\\rcurves real nice - inspires confidence. Fun to drive for a entry-level luxury \\rvehicle. Only complaint is the poor gas mileage. Some do not like the exterior styling - it\\'s a love it or hate it thing. LOVE TURNED TO BROKEN HEART For 48 months this car was exquisite.  Since it is off of warranty we have had a report of a leaking motor mount then when it was 109 degrees outside it quit running in the middle of six lanes of traffic.  Put the hood up and escorted my 70 year old wife, beautiful but still 70, along with our 8 year old great granddaughter to a shady tree next to where the A6 quit.  For over a month my beautiful A6 has been sitting in Audi of Temecula waiting for a fuel pump.  Almost $4,000 in repairs needed for a car I can\\'t even drive since there are no parts in the US and will not be until 8-8.  My love has cooled; six months I researched before purchasing this A6 Quattro, $72,000 that I thought was a 10 year investment, now I\\'m forced to decide whether to keep it or just cut my losses and sell it. Love this car! I\\'ve never purchased a pre-owned vehicle before but decided to do it to purchase this car.  I absolutely love it.  I was driving a Toyota Avalon Limited, which is a very nice vehicle, but it doesn\\'t drive and handle anything close to the Audi.  The technology interface of the Audi is very intuitive and I had it down pretty quickly.  This is a sweet ride and so far I am very pleased with it.  I am happy with the deal I got (about half what a new Audi A6 would have cost), although it needed new tires. Sweet A6 Poor service from dealer. Luckily the A6 is a reliable car. Resale price drops significantly Great car... but by it used! Or lease only. Love my car!! Love my car and everything that Edmund represents!! Great Car Quick, comfort, handling, feel good behind the wheel.  Plenty of punch for 2.0 engine.  great ride & road car.  fun to drive.  People are always complimenting me on looks.  Best car I have had overall. Expected More Great technology when everything works which is not always the case. This vehicle has every electronic and convenience option available in 014. The brakes have an annoying, very aggravating and obvious chatter or shutter when applied at speeds above 35 mph since 3000 from delivery.  Complaints to the dealer resulted in a polite explanation that the brakes are safe and I just have to live with the shuttering as they are not able to cure it under the factory or extended warranty I purchased with the car. For a chance to rid the car of this birth defect they say I will have to pay for replacement rotors and pads.  Aside from the inconvenience of taking it in between scheduled maintenance visits I am otherwise ok with the A6 although several non life threatening electronic system failures were cured each time by the dealer\\'s service department under warranty. UNFORTUNATELY because the brake chattering issue tarnishes the driving experience every time I get behind the wheel and dealers unwillingness or inability to cure it under the warranty,  I would not purchase another car from this manufacturer. While I own it I will keep asking them to address the brake issue each time I have it serviced. Maybe someday they will have a change of heart then perhaps, so will I. Buy One The Audi A 6 is the best car I\\'ve ever owned! Pretty great car Had this car two years, literally no issues at all except for the tires, two tires at 10,000 and 12,000 had the same issue, inside wall failure supposedly due to road hazard, one front and one rear. I have 14,000 miles on this car. Taken two long road trips, from Los Angeles to the Grand Canyon, and Los Angeles to Phoenix. It is fantastic road car, averaged 27.4 MPG. I love the side assist feature, works flawlessly. The Bose sound system is fantastic. The other great feature is the ability to change handling, 4 different settings, love this feature. It\\'s extremely comfortable to drive, easily feel the road through the steering wheel. The navigation takes a bit getting used to as it totally voice controlled, sometimes it takes 2-3 commands for the system to get the address correctly. Overall navigation is quite easy to use. The controls are easy to find and use without distracting attention from the road. The amount of features takes a while to become used to and familiar in using. I chose  the 2.0 engine on purpose, has a lot of torque, and the turbo is immediate in response. And in Los Angeles you\\'ll never use all the power of the 3.0 engine anyway, unless you drive after midnight. I\\'m quite surprised at the quality and reliability of this car, I was expecting some issues, but not one so far, except for the tires. After almost three years I\\'ve yet to have a mechanical, electrical, quality issue of any type. Used it on numerous road trips and handles beautifully, I\\'m quite pleased with the MPG. This car handles and feels as good as the day I purchased it. Overall, I expected some issues over time, but so far, not one. Brakes i lease a 2014 Audi a6. the car sits in my heated garage from December to April. i leased the car in May and  during the first winter the brake pads froze to the rotors. When i tried to move the car in the Spring i had to gun the motor to brake them loose. the audi dealership said the only solution was to replace the rotors and i only had 13,000 miles. i had the rotors turned at a local shop and this lasted for 4 months before the rotors were again corroded. At this point i no choice but to replace the rotors and Audi was no help. they said it was normal wear and tear. The dealership was very helpful in covering some of the costs but Audi covered nothing. Thin twice about a new Audi Best in class Phenomenal mid-size luxury car! All of the benefits of the old, large V8 engines that used to be in the luxury cars, without any drawbacks. Not only do I get smooth power basically anywhere in the powerband, but I get exceptional fuel economy if I am cruising on the highway.  The supercharger allows for the immediacy in power, which is essential for drama-free passing on the highway, and it also allows for quiet, efficient cruising. With a light foot, I have had the car exceed 38 mpg, with normal highway cruising returning ~30 mpg. I mean seriously, it feels like a crime having both power and efficiency.Everything else is as expected: quiet, comfortable cabin with class-leading technology, layout and materials used.  The screen is beautiful, with NVIDIA graphics allowing for beautiful map rendering, the Bose sound system is rich, and the MMI is fantastic once you get used to it. I am techy so it took me about 1 day to learn the system while driving around, but I feel as though almost everything makes sense in terms of layout and ergonomics.  The ride is not as supple as some of ultra-luxury cars with air-suspension, but those cars are no fun to drive. This is the perfect compromise.I bought the car used with ~5k miles on the odometer, which not only took a few thousand off the price, but more importantly gave me the piece of mind of a 5 year 100,000 mile warranty! My only question is how much less power does the 2.0T have? Because for day-to-day commuting, you don\\'t even get into the power in this car.  Yes, it\\'s nice to have the power to pass 98% of cars I see on the highway, but at the same time, 90% of my driving is done with efficiency in mind. 2014 Audi A6 - After 6 months I bought a new A6 Prestige 3.0 in May 2014. Cold weather package, LED, 19\" sport package...etc.\\rAfter owning the car for 6 months, I can say that it is comfortable, quiet, and delivers enough power with the twin turbo engine but this car is not a \"sport sedan\".  It has a tendency to understeer and the dynamic driving mode doesn\\'t seem to help with suspension stiffness.  The power comes in around 3K RPM when the turbo come on.\\rCar interior:  I\\'d give it a B based on the fact that it has 4 zone climate control, ventilated seats, quiet cabin, shades... but these are all options you have to pay for.  Door trim needs leather instead of plastic.  MMI system is a fail.\\r 2.0 Quattro plenty of power.  This is my 3rd A6. I had a 2008 3.2 and then a 2011 3.0. This time I had to decide whether to spend the extra money to stay with the 3.0 engine or drop down to the 2.0. After test driving the 2.0 on local roads and the interstate highway I determined that it had plenty of power for my driving style. My commute to work is only 10 minutes each day and my highway driving is pretty much limited to visiting my kids at college. Power accelerating onto the highway was great and going up hills locally was fine. Transmission shifts very smoothly.I saved a lot of money dropping down to the 2.0 while maintaining all the other great Audi features that I had in my prior two A6s.  2014 Audi 3.0 Quattro Premium Plus Comfortable & beautiful luxurious interior. Fit & finish in & out excellent. All buttons & switches have a Quality feel.Loaded with options .Excellent ride that is adjustable.I have the handling option with 19\"all season tires. The 20\" wheel option probably gives a rougher ride. Very supple ride with sport sedan feel & comfort.Steering & engine & shift styles also adjustable. Transmission (8 speed) shifts very smoothly.Very pleasant ride at high speeds & solid road feel. You can be going 85 - 90 MPH & not feel the speed. Very comfortable adjustable seats.Lately, have brake vibration at 60 mph +. Dealer service fees pricey . Sunroof switch stopped working. Dealer replacement cost $358 !!! Perfect car A perfect cross between comfort ride and quick, responsive acceleration. Subtleties in cabin design give a sense of an expansive cockpit with the right amount of leather and wood trim to give a luxurious feel but still got the aluminum accent for its sporty side.Got mine with Prestige package, LED lights, and cold weather package for $57,200.  Great car Solid performer - not overwhelmingly \"fast\", but plenty quick, gobs of low end torque, 40MPG highway in an executive sedan.  Tachometer reads 2,000 RPM at 90 MPH, so motor is not working hard at normal highway speeds. Best car I’ve owned! See above Great driver\\'s car We love to drive this car. It\\'s a rocket,  getting  40 to 42 MPG on the highway. Beautiful interor, quiet. Beautiful body, tough on tires, Owned my 2014 A6 TDI Premium+ for 18 months and have driven it 30,000 miles. Pros: THE best looking styling of all European/Japanese/American mid-size luxury sedans, hands down. Love the TDI diesel--44+mpg combined, quicker than a bullet, quiet engine (see the one major con on this engine below). Road handling is superb and this car is a blast to drive on a curvy highway. Cons--On the other hand...not the most comfy to drive on long trips and I have taken this car cross country. I get it\\'s a sports sedan but after a while the lack of expected comfort starts to wear on you (esp. on a $60,000+ car). Tires--I have 30,000 miles on them, I don\\'t drive hard, but the dealer told me I have about 10,000 miles left on them. What? 40,000 miles on a set of Dunlops? Biggest beef--as the tread wears down the noise these tires make is unbearably loud. Last issue-- Audi sends me a letter letting me know my TDI diesel engine was engineered to run on UP TO 5% biodiesel. Unfortunately I live in a state that mandates the sale of 20% biodiesel in the warmer months. Nice. Wish my dealer would have mentioned that to me when I bought the car. Audi goes on  to state in the letter to me that in any event, they WILL honor any warranty issues arising out of the use of this biodiesel. As one who usually \"buys them and drives them forever\",  I don\\'t think I want to own this car after the warranty expires. I love this car but doubtful I will buy another diesel engine as long as I live in this state. I realize this is not Audi\\'s problem but hopefully they are working on this biodiesel issue. Incessant Brake Squealing I have admired Audi\\'s light and interior design for sometime.  In May of 2014, I made the move from an MB to a \\'14 A6 TDI Prestige.\\r I absolutely love the look of the car especially with the LED\\'s and black out package.  The power is great and fuel economy is nothing short of impressive.\\r My biggest complaint is the horribly incessant brake squeal.  At 9200 miles I have already had the car in 3 times for this repair.  First it was brake dust and I need to slam on the ABS to clear it.  Seriously on $65k \"German Engineered\" car?  The next time it was we scored the pads and added no squeal.  When I dropped it off this time I said I don\\'t want it back until it\\'s fixed.   Best car i\\'ve ever owned. I absolutely love this car. I recently upgraded from an Avalon. There is no comparison. The diesel engine provides tons of power and I still get 30+ mpg despite my aggressive driving style. Every button for every function is easily within reach and does not distract from the great driving experience.  Simply Superb Mid-Sized Luxury Sedan The A6 TDI is simply a superb blend of luxury, performance and efficiency.I have just over 2,000 miles on this car and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The build quality and fit and finish are outstanding. This car has that machined from a single billet solidity that is only in the best German sedans.It is both an effortless highway cruiser and despite its size a tight back road caver. The technology package is easy to use and fairly intuitive however to get the most out of it a careful read of the MMI manual is a must.The diesel engine in a word is awesome! Yes there is a modest typical chatter at idle but once underway its smooth quiet and pulls like a freight train! The performance/MPG sweet spot My TDI is equipped with S-Line option package & optional 20\" wheels with summer performance tires. It is both gorgeous (and menacing!) looking and incredibly fun to drive. For most people and most situations, the diesel **is** the high performance option, effortlessly building speed and dispatching almost all tasks without feeling like it\\'s even trying. In normal, sedate driving, the tach doesn\\'t exceed 2,000 RPMs, yet it hits its maximum torque output within this range, which is the secret to the extraordinary fuel efficiency/performance combination. And if you want to do spirited driving, it is happy to oblige, and it sounds happy to rev. Most folks would never know it\\'s a diesel.**Update as of 10/16: Still loving my A6 TDI.  I have put may miles on loaner Audis with the 3.0T and 2.0T engines.  In each case, I could not wait to get back behind the wheel of my TDI. My lifetime average fuel economy is over 32 MPG--for a 4,300 pound car with all-wheel drive that can hurdle to 60 mph in about 5 1/2 seconds!The TDI emissions scandal may make these exceptional buys on the pre-owned market.  I\\'m still awaiting the final manufacturer\\'s fix, which for the 3.0L engine will likely be a software update,  since this engine has the urea based exhaust treatment system.  I anxiously await what I hope will be the eventual return of diesel models to the U.S. market.****Update as of 10/24/17: still no emissions fix, but the car now has more than 106,000 miles, and it runs beautifully, still exceeding EPA fuel economy figures if I drive anywhere close to the speed limit.  The price premium for the diesel engine paid for itself in fuel savings more than 50,000 miles ago.  As of this week where I live in Illinois, diesel is $2.35 per gallon, while premium unleaded (which is what the gasoline counterpart calls for) is $2.99. TDI! Have had my A6 TDI Prestige with 19\" Sport Package for 2 months and 2,400+ miles now, and it has met or exceeded all expectations. Having come from a 2010 3.0T A6, the TDI feels just as powerful as the 3.0T (albeit rated about 60HP less), but then again it\\'s all about the torque with this car (428 lb ft). The MPG (easily averaging 30mpg+ in mixed driving, and close to 40 on long highway runs) and the range (averaging close to 600 miles/tank) are incredible for a car of this size and power. Love all the tech in this compared to my prior A6, and the car just looks great in Daytona Gray w/ all black interior, 19\" sport pkg and full LED headlights to top it all off.  Still beautiful Great interior and exterior design, very refined. If it had the latest safety technology I would keep it for many years more. Love the car. Quiet. Quite. Smooth acvrlaratiom Good car for what I pay Good mid size car if you willing to pay not too much for a audi. First luxury car 3L Turbo- a rocket.  Handling is impressive. Never had a problem. Will buy again. Bang for your buck I purchased the car used about 6 months ago and am sold on Audi from here on out. I looked into the S4 as well and went with the A6 3.0t in the end because of the added room and larger gas tank. I had an aftermarket APR tune put on the car and did a Pully swap (making it a stage 2) and couldn\\'t be happier. The car was fun to drive before but the tune really woke up some serious potential in the car. You step on the gas and it\\'s just effortless how it moves. I plan on keeping the car for a few more years before upgrading to an S6 next. For what these cars go for new being able to pick on up used that\\'s been well taken car of gives you a lot of car for the $$$. I looked at a couple other brands before the purchase of this car and you just can\\'t beat the Audi fit and finish...highly recommend this car and Audi\\'s in general. Best Car I\\'ve Had (Overall) I have had cars that are more fun to drive (Honda S2000), larger sedans (Volvo S80), and even another Audi that I thought was my favorite car (A4 convertible), but none has been as completely the total package as this car.The A6, while a bit blah on the exterior, is nearly perfect from the inside.The cabin is roomy, the seats are comfortable, the electronics are helpful, and simple to use, and the fit and finish is fantastic.The supercharged 3.0 has excellent torque at all speeds, and when the supercharged adds its punch, you best be ready to roll, quickly.I nearly rear ended the car I intended to pass the first time I punched it.The engine and trans are so perfectly mated.Score! Unreliable Driving Machine I have owned 5 Audis over 15 years.This A6 will be the last one.In less than 7000 miles it has been in for repairs 6 times, including 3 times for check engine light, 1x for passenger air bag off, 1x for moldings falling off the back doors, etc.Dealer has been helpful and supportive, unlike Audi USA who I find to be inaccessible and uncooperative.When the car is not at the dealer being repaired it runs great as Audis do.Watch out though for low profile tires - a silly design feature that leads to frequent blowouts when you hit one of the many potholes we have in New England.Gas mileage of 21/30 is accurate.You might even do a little better. 2011 Audi A6 3.0T Prestige - A True Sports Sedan After driving Lexus since \\'94, I got rid of my \\'08 LS due to quality problems / high price.I ruled out the Lexus GS because I drove one for 10 years and don\\'t like the new ones + Lexus quality issues.I also ruled out the MB E-class (don\\'t like what they did with it, all the plastic in it or its price), BMW 535 (insane price) and the Hyundai Genesis (can\\'t stand local dealers), narrowing things to Audi A6 and Infiniti M37.The A6 is a much better performance car that is more fun to drive with styling I prefer - article on Car and Driver comparing A6, M37 and 535 is on point, particularly high RPM for M37.I am very happy with the A6 even though M37 may be a better value to some. V8 is awesome It\\'s hard to believe there is a better car.   The V8 is the ticket.  Despite reviews from others, I thought the 3.0T was weak -- compared to the 4.2. And unlike the transmission mated to the V6, you can hardly feel it shift in the V8. The 3.0T has to work to accelerate. But if you can\\'t feel the difference in your test drive, then save your money and buy the 3.0T. The 4.2 engine growls and accelerates smoothly.  Unlike the 3.0T, you can\\'t feel the vibration of the engine in the steering wheel. The fit and trim is incredible. And the lines are just breath taking. Test drove an E350, and just can\\'t see why people pay the extra money, the A6 is hands down the better vehicle. 2011 A6 QUATTRO 3.0T For the most part car is awesome and fun to drive. Fuel economy is better than I thought at 27 ave, but I do mostly highway mileage MMI Interface is easy to use and understand. Much easier than the E350 and BMW 5 series I looked at.  Only issues so far after 4k miles is Check engine light came on , but went out 3 days later after I refueled. Audi said it was either gas cap issue or low octane fuel. Also MMI rebooted once while driving but reset itself. Seems to function fine  Blue tooth works great with IPhone4 although Audi advises not to use 4.0 updates Sound system is great but cannot directly record CDs to Hard drive. Need to copy to MPS files first, then copy.  V8 is the better choice I am the former owner of a 08 A6 with the 4.2 V8 engine.  And I was looking to upgrade to a 2011 Audi A6.  After reading Edmund\\x92s review on how great the 3.0T engine was, I thought I could save $5K and buy the V6.  I then went to my local dealership and test-drove the V6. And after the test-drive?  Do not believe Edmunds, go try both and form your own opinion.  In mine, no comparison with my 08 V8, not even close. The 0 to 60 thing, 5.8 sec. (for the V8) versus 5.9 (for the V6) are close, and are probably true (and no Edmunds, the V6 is not quicker than the V8, and did you really do your research, did you really test drive both models?). The 2011 A6 is an excellent vehicle. Great Car  I love this car! That said it takes a lot of money to keep it well feed and healthy. I bought it at a charity auction (Never buy from one, trust me). The car was low miles and a great price. Two months later the transmission went out and cost over 3k to fix. Once she was up and running again, it\\'s been great.   Too bad they don\\'t make an A8 wagon! We\\'ve had gasket and seal issues, but \\rthey seem to have been resolved.  \\rElectrical is not the greatest, and \\rrear seat legroom is tight - \\respecially for a bunch of tall people.\\r Those things aside, this is the most \\rbalanced, smoothest, most well-\\rengineered car we\\'ve owned.  It is a \\rjoy to drive - even if it is a wagon - \\rthough a little more power would be \\rnice.  If only it were a little \\rbigger... Fun to drive car A great car, fun to drive, quattro in \\rWisconsin is wonderful.  No problems in \\rthe year i have owned it.  Starts out \\rin the snow as if the pavement was dry.\\rBuy one you will love it. The SUV killer: the A6 Quattro Wagon Bought my A6 quattro wagon new in RI. \\rUsed if for commuting and carpooling and\\rit it also got complements for its looks\\rand ride.  Never had a problem in bad\\rweather with the car.  Moved to SanDeigo\\rand I put 18\" performance tires on the\\rcar and handles like a 5 series.  Plan\\ron lowering it an inch as well.  Best\\rpurchase I could have made I have the\\rversitility of an SUV but the comfort of\\ra luxury sedan and the sportness of a\\rsport sedan.  Can\\'t wait to purchase my\\rnext audi quattro wagon. 20 year old car great ride but too many electronic glitches 20 years old, drives like new! This vehicle is far ahead of its time, drives amazing, handles well, responsive,  and very clean and easy to operate... I have no idea why it doesn\\'t seem to hold it\\'s value better... at least this vehicle is exceptional... I did put some work and $$ to get everything like new,  but still seems like I well under paid compared to how it performs... If I could buy a new car like this one I would. I was initially impressed with how solid and tight this car was from day one. The styling of this car has endured the test of time and have always enjoyed and been a proud owner of this car. Parting with it has not been easy. The only negative has been the pickup on it this car which is a bit slow for my taste. The Bose sound system has been just fantastic and still is. I elected to get an option for anti-corrosion and there is not a bit of rust after suffering years of Michigan winters and salty Florida coastlines. The seats are still in great shape and extremely comfortable. The newer Audis are much stiffer now and not as comfortable. We have elected to shift to Lexus for styling, comfort and reliability. Security I owned this car for 2 years now and as I am speaking I don\\'t know where it is now. It has been stolen 4 times now. If you live in a bad neighborhood, this is not the right car for you. Even a baby can steal this car. Other than that everything else is superb with this car. Fun to drive but starts shaking once you hit 80. Perfecto I own a 1998 Audi A6 Quattro wagon with 250,000 miles and I trust this car to take me anywhere I traded my much loved 98 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer for it I get great gas mileage and it\\'s very comfortable I recently drove it from Mich to Va on a tank of gas I would recommend this car to anyone. I have never had to put this car in the shop. Piece of junk I can\\'t believe the ratings are as high as they are.  Way more repair issues than ANY car deserves.  Now I have 120k mi and spends more time in shop than home!  Expensive to get worked on.  Many issues throughout life of car.  Would never ever buy another Audi. Secrets to owning an Audi Okay, this was my dad\\'s car.  He bought it after I\\'d bought an A4.  Two secrets:  One, if you drive a lot of miles each year, they don\\'t last.  Two, find a good independent mechanic as soon as the warranty period is over.  My A4 was costing me 2k every time I needed an oil change and I finally sold it.  My dad\\'s A6 did better, he doesn\\'t drive much and took it to a local place to have work done.  And I\\'ve lost count how many times he\\'s lost the front lower spoiler on curb stops. This is a great ride. I seriously considered Mercedes, BMW less so before buying the A6. No complaints or regrets, this is a great car. Comfortable, safe, fast, secure. We\\'ll soon be shopping for our next car, and because of our experience with this one, our bias will be for Audis. BEST Car ever owned I bought this car with 7000 miles on it and about 9 years later it has 229,000 miles on it and drives the same as it did when i bought it. The interior and exterior far surpass any car of its age on the road. Luxury Worth A Look! Perhaps the first thought that comes to mind for many drivers is the Quattro AWD on this car, a feature that helps in the Snow Belt of the country. Yet beyond this, the handling is adept and definitely unique to this car; nothing short of amazing, this car remains supple without wallowing. This car is solid, large, and comfortable for 4, the 5th will feel out of place, especially if a full sized adult. Power is just fine for this car, and gas mileage is suprisingly good (mid 20\\'s). Quality of build is wonderful, although most repairs will require garage intervention-this is not a shady tree mechanic car. Audi went above and beyond with this car, and it really shows. love her I got this car from California in January of 05.  She had 9800 miles on her and was stored in a garge for years and only driven to keep her healthy.  I purchased her for $9800 and I have loved driving her every day since shipping her here to michigan.  This car has had only a few problems. Front door locks would not release and I had to have the door locks replaced, and then the engine therm went and that repair cost more than fixing the doors.  All in all I love this car. Cute and Diverse I love this car!  Though I got this car used it was in good condition.  It is a stylish piece of automotive niceness.  It handles better then my other cars and speedy as well.  It moves nicely, brakes great, and is very comfortable.  Make sure you take yours to a person who knows Audis.  I didn\\'t and got a higher quote then if I went to the guy who did know what he was talking about.   pay the price I bought my audi with 40k drove it to a 100k and sold it had it for three years. A very nice car to drive I must say my only problem with the car is it cost a thousand dollers every three months in little nickel and dime problems my front head light went out and it cost 1,000 between the igniter and the lamp for 1 head light. the power windows went out several times. the engine light would come on regulary and would all ways cost me at least a grand each time. Now I am going to by a mercedes or bmw or lexus. Great Design, Poor Reliability Like most reviewers here, I bought my A6 right after it came off of a 3-yr lease. I wondered, \"Why would the original owner not buy this wonderful car?\" The maintenance is horrific on this car but the car drives so well, and the styling is so superb, I am conflicted over whether or not I would make the purchase again. My mistake was in not purchasing an extended warranty, something that I would never have even considered after owning several Japanese cars. I thought that only American cars needed extended warranties. But when you look at similar year BMWs & Mercedes, there was really no contest. The BMW was faster & the Benz had more recognition, but Audi won the styling competition easily. Many trips for repair shop    Purchased in 2002 with 25,000 miles and loved the car until 50,000 miles when all the repairs started. Now have 100,000 miles 3yrs later. Have replaced all control arms, (2)oil leaks (rear Cam Adjuster seals @ $1,300 each), wheel bearings, dash readout, heater control flap, tie rods, headlight washer pump. Check Engine light comes on at least every 4-5,000 miles and cost $25 to reset.     Luckly I purchased an after market warranty for $1,000 and have had $7,700 in covered repairs. Warranty ran out at 100,000 miles and I\\'m debating weather to keep the car. I love driving but worry what repairs are next.   Make sure you\\'re wealthy Don\\'t buy one that\\'s not certified! It is a great car, but costs big $$$ to get fixed.  Don\\'t take to dealerships! Got 19-20 MPH average (Stinks!) Had all kinds of issues at first. Hit a pothole for $5k of damage. Had a wheel fall off while driving due to a bearing and control arm just breaking off. Engine started leaking oil pretty bad at like 95K.  Was still running at 150k, but was hurting. New brakes every 20k or so, new tires about the same, new head lights pretty often.  Bent my rims all the time.  Always thrashed my front bottoming out. Awesome in the snow - even if the snow was over the hood! Crashes VERY well. Head on with a Jeep Grande Cherokee and no injuries. Car dead. Near-Perfect Car I\\'ve gone through quite a few cars in recent years, including VW Passat, Acura TL, Lexus ES300.  This car beats all of them by far and yes, even purchased used.  Strong engine, good fuel economy, go-anywhere AWD, luxurious interior (leather & real wood!) with everything at your fingertips, tiptronic transmission.  I can ride in this car for hours w/o any backache.   Affordable Luxury I purchased my 1998 Audi A6 pre-owned with \\r85,000 miles on it. I read lots of reviews before \\rpurchasing and was concerned with \\rreliability issues. However, after a test drive I\\rfell in love with the A6 and bought it anyway. \\rNow a year and 28,000 miles later I\\'m still \\rvery pleased with the car. Audi\\'s Quality is not good I bought my 1998 Audi A6 Sedan with 51,000 miles\\ron it and had numerous probelms. I Spent over $2,000 \\rto fix things that should not occur in a car with 52k miles, \\rincluding a new axle, head light washer, water pump, \\rleakign oil seals, electonic display, etc... Still love it after 6 yrs & $$ to keepup I\\'ve admired Audi vehicles since the 80\\'s and fell in\\rlove with the \\'98 A6 styling, particularily the \\rinterior.  I felt secure with the 4 yr 60k warranty but \\rwas still disappointed in the numerous trips back to \\rthe dealer for electrical (info panel on instrument \\rdisplay, window lift motors), interior hardware, and \\rengine issues (fuel injectors, washer reservoir leaks, \\roil leak - valve cover and main engine seal).  I also \\rhad to replace the front bumper cover (Audi \\rreinbursed) due to it continuously catching on \\rcurbs.  But the last two years have been relatively \\rtrouble free and it still is a joy to drive and my 15  \\ryear old son\\'s friend think it\\'s really cool.  I do too! Fun Until...... Fun to drive, like all Audis. Great for \\rthe driver, better for the mechanic! \\rEngine started leaking oil at 30K \\rMiles. Check engine light went on at \\r45K miles because of a recall related \\ritem. ABS went out at 70K miles. The \\relectrical system blows bulbs all the \\rtime. Spotty build quality + German \\rmechanics = no money left at the end of \\rthe day.  Nice Car, Expensive to Repair Nice Vehicle. Bought 2 months ago. Some \\rproblems included rim leaks,window \\rfailure (drivers side), battery start, \\rair bag light. Also the bose speakers \\rblew on the drivers side door, but are \\rok now. Repairs on this car are very \\rhigh. Don\\'t buy the car if you cannot \\rafford the up keep! I like it I love it I am overwhelmed by my pre-owned A6.   Unbelivable Quality Silly Ride, and Handling - LIke a \\rSpider crawling Through the Roads, \\rGrips roads with LOVE. Pure Luxury at \\ran Affordable PRICE. Great Car Great Value Fell in love with this car from DAY 1, \\rNow is about Day 3, Only got better -  Audi My new First Choice I have owned this car for 4 Years, and \\rAm now about to buy the A4, and trade \\rthis car in. 4yrs - 120k miles on the \\rcar, Still Drives and Handles the same \\rway i bought it, The ride is very \\rLuxorious Highway is Perfect, smooth \\rand Never gets boring with this car. I \\rrecomend it. A6 Class B Luxury Affordable Relaible I bought this car about a year ago. \\rHeard many electrical problems with \\rthe car, And it said it was very UN-\\rRelaible.. NOT TRUE! Had a Minor \\rwindow problem, Connection Got loose, \\rMy mech tells me this happens a lot \\rwith these cars. Only Problem, and the \\rcar is driven RUFF. Has 100k On it \\rnow, Drove 25k Miles - Very smooth \\rRide.  Audi engineering/ service poor at  best Audi and the 3 dealerships I have \\rdealt with should be ashamed of \\rthemselves.  This is not German \\rengineering/service at it\\'s finest.  \\rI have had nothing but problems from \\rday one, oil leaks, injector problems. \\rAfter 3 visits to have the same oil \\rleak fixed, the service mgr told me he \\rthought I should consider buying a new \\rcar.  It still leaks oil. There is a \\rsix week wait to get the car in for \\rservice because they don\\'t have enough \\rtrained mechanics.\\rNow, after spending $2K on a \\rtransmission module which was to fix \\rmy current problem they tell me I now \\rneed to replace the transmission.      Just an Overpriced Volkswagen Loved this car when bought used in \\r2000.  Unfortunately, vehicle appears \\rto be jinxed.  Has been in for repairs \\rway too many times.  Washer fluid tank \\rleaked. Instrument panel has been \\rreplaced onced before and needs to be \\rreplaced again due to LED fading.  \\rTransmission blew out at about 70k \\rmiles.  Now leaks oil.  Good thing I \\rpurchased after-market extended \\rwarranty, which I wouldn\\'t normally do \\r(wife talked me in to it).  I\\'ll never \\rpurchase another Audi again and \\radvised others not to either. Great when running The car is very fun to drive, however \\rthings keep breaking. The car has 32K \\ron it and in the last 12 months I have \\rspent over $4,000 on repairs. Some I \\rdid some repairs myself and others I \\rtook to an independent shop or the \\rdealer. Since this review is limited \\rto 700 characters I can\\'t even begin \\rto list the problems Buy at own risk Bought this car new, and it spent more \\rtime in service or waiting for service \\rthan it did on the road.  Had ~30K in \\rwarentee work done over the 3 years I \\rhad it, finally traded in for a new \\rHonda.  It was bearly running when it \\rwas traded.  Really expect more from \\rAudi, never again.  It even straded me \\r3 times. audi a6 great car. elegant interior. very stable - 100  Too Tempermental !! Bought used with 35 K miles. Since I \\rbought it two weeks ago, it has spent 1 \\rand 1/2 weeks in shop with electrical \\rproblems. I love this car- when it \\rworks. I don\\'t have the time or \\rpatience to continue taking it in for \\rrepairs. I\\'m very disappointed. If I \\rcan unload it, it will be back to \\rJapanese cars for me. Love Hate Relationship I fell in love with this car the second \\rI drove it \\x96 yes even girls love cars! \\rIt handles very well in New England \\rsnow & after giving up my much loved \\rrear-wheel drive BMW the Audi AWD was a \\rGod send! I did however fall victim to \\rthe nasty fuel tank problem & had the \\rsensors replaced 3 times. Once the \\rdealer even contaminated the gas with \\rdiesel! The dealer & Audi in general \\rhave been the hate part of my car \\rrelationship. Would I buy this car \\ragain? I would have to say No. The \\rreason: The dealers, I know, I\\x92ve been \\rto most of them within 80 miles of \\rBoston & have yet to find a competent \\rone!  Alas, BMW this is where you win. My Audi A6 is a Perennial oil leaker Its a fine car but overall mechanical \\rquality suffers relative to its price \\rrange.  I had to replace every single \\rengine seal and gasket before 60,000 \\rmiles!  Some of the gaskets I replaced \\rjust 16,000 miles ago are now failing \\ragain.  My steering is now starting to \\rgo out.  I have previously owned a \\rMitsubishi, Honda, Toyota and a \\rSuburu.  This car has required by far \\rthe most repair maintenance of all \\rthose models....combined.   Fun Car Very Nice Warking car CONTROL ARMS CONTROL ARMS I had constant problems with the \\rcontrol arms. I spent over $5000 in \\rmaintance in 2 years. Beautiful ride, \\rspacious interior, & a nightmare to \\rmaintain. greatness best car ever. Is is true german iron.  Loyality will now be spelled A-U-D-I My experience with the A6 has been  Beautiful but Poor Quality Many issues with this car. Transmission \\rproblem ($6,000 repair!!) Low front end \\rgetting caught on parking barriers, \\rFuel injectors (Dealer said don\\'t start \\rthe car, pull it out of garage and turn \\roff - not good for the engine.) - Cost \\rme almost 2000 to replace injectors and \\rother assorted fuel and electronics \\rto\"fix\" But it is beatiful to drive and \\rlook at  2.8 is adequate but not \\rexciting.  Audi should do something \\rabout the reliability. Love the car - Hate the repairs Great looking and riding car, but \\rimpossible to keep running.  By 60,000 \\rmiles it had a new water pump ($800) \\rand needed new valve gaskets, cam \\rgasket, axle flange gaskets and a new \\rrear differential.  I thought I was \\rgoing to miss the luxury when I traded \\rit in, but it was a real relief to get \\rrid of the expensive repairs.  The Audi \\rdealership had the attitude \"if you \\rdon\\'t have enough income to be giving \\rlots of money to us - tough\" Love the car - hate the repairs This car drives like a dream.  But with \\ronly 60,000 miles on it I have had to \\rreplace the water pump, replace all the \\rvalve gaskets and the rear differential \\rgasket.  I am averaging almost $400 a \\rmonth in maintenance and repairs.  I am \\rreally going to miss the comfort, \\rluxury, and handling of this car when I \\rtrade it in on a more reliable, less \\rexpensive car to own. Great   I still am not too excited about the \\rlook of the rear tail lights and I \\rthink that the center cup holder is a \\rpoor design.  One 7-11 big gulp and a \\rslight sharp turn and your cup holder \\ris reduced to broken plastic. How can \\rAudi put a donut spare in a car of this \\rmagnitude?  Other than that, I love \\rthis car! It gets a lot of looks and \\rcompliments and I love the safe feel \\rthat I get with the handling and the \\rall wheel drive. \\r AUDI MAKES ONE AMAZING CAR!!! This car is by far the best thing I \\rcould ask for. It has all the best \\rfeatures any person could ask for. The \\rassurance in winter in Chicago of \\rFULLTIME Quattro, by far the best \\rsystem ever made (just ask rallycross(A \\rcompetition offraod race league that \\rBANNED quattro from its track because \\rit gave an unfair advantage, the same \\radvantage Audi gives you on their \\rfactory cars, like my A6. I have gotten \\rout of muck mudand 12 inch snow, more \\rthan my 4WD Chevy BLAZER could ever do. \\rPlus you have a world calass car with \\rbetter, more attreactive build quality \\rthan any mercedes or utilitarian BMW!!!! I was dupped! VERY disappointed...thinking I was \\rbuying a luxury car, and I got a luxury \\rmaint. bill.  NEVER buy an Audi again! This Car Saved My Life This is a great car.  Not only does it \\rlook beautiful, but it is extremly \\rsafe. I walked away from a horrible \\raccident w/ only a broken hand. \\rI also got many compelements on the \\runique look of the car from total \\rstrangers.  It was very fun to drive, \\rbut it did get poor gas mileage (19-\\r24mpg).\\rThe only complaint i have about the \\rbody is that the front end sits very \\rlow and can easily be damaged by \\rconcrete parking barriers.  Granted I \\ronly had my A-6 for 4mos and 4,000 \\rmiles, but i would recommend the car. DON\\'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!! I bought my car used, with about 32,000 \\rmiles on it.  I have driven it about \\r23,000 miles, and over the 18 months \\rI\\'ve owned it, have had the car in the \\rshop 14 times. Not minor things either -\\r new upper and lower oil pans, bad fuel \\rinjection system, all new sparks,etc., \\rbasically everthing but the tranny. \\rThis car is the most unreliable piece \\rof junk I have ever had the displeasure \\rof owning.  Now I know why the previous \\rowner traded it in at 32,000 miles, he \\rwas sick and tired of the unrealibility \\rtoo.  I can\\'t wait to trade this hunk \\rof junk in!

Overall build \\rquality poor. TOO FREQUENT \\rMAINTENANCE. Would not purchase again. Smooooooth! I like this car it gets many  Smooth but not powerful So far the car has been very reliable.  Why would anyone not want this car Great car for the money German Junk Expensive to repair, many trips to the dealership Truly a beast I started driving about three years ago, just as the RS6 came to the U.S. I received an A6 2.8 for my first car, a loved the way the car drove. Recently, I have become obsessed with owning an RS6; so I purchased one. This car is amazing; it handles corners in the wet like no other family sedan, and it will lay waste to most Porsches and Ferraris. I hate putting the miles on my RS6, but it is so fun to drive, I have to take it out of the garage at least once a week. It truly is a beast of a car. most exciting car I\\'ve ever owned! I\\'ve owned and loved \\'67 Austin Cooper S, \\'95 Mercedes C36 AMG, \\'01 Audi S6, and \\'03 Audi S8, but this RS6 Is at the top of the heap! The seats are the most comfortable I\\'ve had in any Audi. The 3 spoke steering wheel is perfect. The acceleration is indescribeable - I\\'m thinking maybe space shuttle! If you hit the brakes hard, you get a straight stop  that feels like you hit the emergency catch net on an aircraft carrier! The Quattro does it\\'s job flawlessly and undetectably. Despite the incredible levels of performance, this car is docile enough that my 76 year old mother could drive it. Audi RS6 A very fast car, marvelous on the highway and fun to drive.  Great acceleration between 80 mph and 130 mph.  Not as good on a slalom  as a BMW 5 series because the forward engine results in a large moment of inertia, but dynamite on those  sweeping 120 MPH curves.  It has been trouble free.  The tires, as on so many performance cars, are not able to take potholes (expensive lesson), but they grip extremely well. For a car with more than 400 lb-ft of torque, the all-wheel drive allows you to drive with surprising ease on icy roads.  It gets 25 mpg on the highway at 60 mph but about 15 mph in heavy traffic (i.e., it ain\\'t cheap, with that 93 octane fuel needed by the 10:1 compression ratio). Traded up The RS6\\'s understated appearance coupled with its generous power makes for an uncomplicated driving experience. It is not often that I find the need to indulge in the full power of this vehicle, but it\\'s satisfying when it is needed. So much fun.. so practical.. A perfect compromise for my family.  \\rOutrageously fun to drive.  Enough \\rroom in the back for a car seat.  I \\rkeep looking for excuses to go out an \\rdrive the car.  Pick-up is great from \\r0-60.  Pick-up when passing (50 - 90) \\ris simply unbelievable.  If you get \\rone, you\\'re going to want to live in \\rit (and you could probably buy a small \\rapartment in the mid-west for the same \\rprice, so maybe you should).  If price \\ris no object and you want a car that \\ris both fun and practical, this is it. Epitome of the four P\\'s Panache, practicality (roomy back seat) \\rand phantastically phast -- what more \\rcould one want? Better MPG, maybe, but \\rcomparable cars are just as bad (e.g. \\rE55 AMG) -- and they don\\'t have or \\roffer All Wheel Drive. I\\'ve never \\rdriven this much in one year (24K mi), \\rwhich says a lot. Spent time in shop \\rafter 10K mi but turns out that was due \\rto poor communication at Audi rather \\rthan parts availability, which was \\rblamed at the time.  Also have 2000 \\rAudi S4 & need to sell one of them.  \\rLove the S4 too; more nimble and, with \\ra chip, almost as fast. But even tho \\rselling the RS6 would bring $40+K more, \\rI have no such plans. RS6 pleases eyes, \\rears, even nose!  Best car ever My S8 was good, but the RS6 is spectacular.  The \\ronly \"con\" is the mediocre interior detail.  NAV is \\rterrible system requires new CD halfway from Philly \\rto NY.  Transmission and most everything is last \\ryears.  No map screen.

Like it better than my prior BMW M6\\'s Love the all wheel drive. Happier as I own it. This car grows on me i can\\'t wait to drive again when the weather gets better. I sold my first Audi in the summer and 3 months later bought another one. I am glad I did, here it is spring of 2018 and I can\\'t wait to start driving it again Audi S5 turns heads and excites the senses Own a 2012 S5 after testing the 2.0 A5 in pretty much every configuration available at the dealership.I\\'m not sure why Edmunds thinks the steering is \"contrived\" or \"artficial\" because my experience is of an extremely tactile and responsive control system. My own gas mileage IS actually improving as I learn how to properly drive the car.Now at 1000 miles I am getting closer to 26 to 28 hwy and 15 to 19 city mpg now thanks to my judicious use of the responsive cruise control, and active mileage monitoring system, and I can adjust my driving style to suit.Well-mannered in traffic when it needs to be, and becomes an elegant beast when pushed with very little effort. The latest version of the classic S5 Audi has improved on the older S5 model by adding the Rear Sports Differential where you can make the engine more aggressive, the steering tighter, and the rear wheels shift torque sidesways when cornering. Because of the dynamic mode, this S5 feels much faster, tighter, and much more fun to drive as it incorporates the technology of the new S4.It feels as fast and fun as the new S4 compared to the 2009 S5 I tested.In terms of gas mileage, I achieved 22 MPG on my initial break-in out-of-town trip (mostly highway), and 19 MPG in city driving. I feel that highway driving could easily get to 25-26MPG after break-in.Beauty, performance, & the V8 sound makes the s5 as class of its own. Fun car to drive if works Had fun with my S5 cabrio for 15 days. Day 16 around 600miles transmission broke, barely made it home. Waiting for almost a week now to have it replaced. Regret about buying it, should have leased it instead. Audi S5 Quattro Drives nice, lot of technology, plenty of power for highway rampup.  Cost is high comparatively but comes with the Audi brand. Want some fun! Had an 06 A5 Premium convertible. Gorgeous and fun to drive but not enough umph!  This one on the other hand has the HP my 06 Mustang GT had after some mods to the GT and I doubt the Mustang could outrun it. That sayin something folks!  It’s a prestige and I know I know that’s taking it little too far if all your after is horsepower...but I don’t regret it. Took it on  a 2000 mile trip and was quite surprised about the mpg even doing 80-90 mph on the interstate. How’s 31 mpg sound?  Speaking of sound, WOW!  It will take you awhile to learn all the features but you’ll enjoy the process and what Audi has done. Drawbacks?  The auto stop engine feature when idling maybe but the feature functions flawlessly. This is a 10 year car for us. Wife drives it more than I do and loves it!  It’s white with the red interior so kinda on the feminine side but she looks awesome in it! Audi has done it Right!  (Again) The newly redesigned Audi S5 is a absolute blast to drive.  Its so good that i traded my 2017 S6 in for it! Fantastic Upgrade from 2015 S5. The overall feel to me is a higher level of sophistication than previous generation.   Audi has made a step up in overall quality of interior design, materials and switch gear.  Suspension changes are quite noticeable which provides a more sure footed feel.  Gone is the under steer tendency when aggressively taking corners.  It feels much quicker with surges of power more instantaneous across the RPM band than the previous generation due to the Turbo providing low end torque where the 2015 Supercharged engine only produced that kind of torque over 3k RPM.  Didn\\'t think Audi could improve the interior but they did.  Seats are more supportive and yet more comfortable,  The changes to the MMI took a little getting use to but now it is second nature accessing information is faster with the new button layout.   Input of information is easier too especially with the touch handwriting recognition.  MMI\\\\Navi computer is much faster.  No lag time between screens and the navigation display is amazingly sharp and directions are accurate.  The visual cockpit is a joy to use.  Information right in front of you where it should be.  Love the multi gauge setups.  Even the B&O stereo system is a step up in sound quality.  Very glad I upgraded to the 2018. My First Audi. Glad it was the 2018 S5 Prestige! This car is absolutely incredible. It drives and handles like a  dream. The technology can be a bit overwhelming at first but once you get used to how things work it is great. The controls and ergonomics of the cabin are almost perfect. Great quality materials in the buttons, high-quality diamond stitched Nappa leather and a sound system that is fantastic. Everything is arranged within the cabin with the driver as the focus of all controls and electronics. The virtual cockpit is incredible to use as is everything else. Engine response is superb with just a slight turbo lag in the low rpm range below 1300rpm. Once past that line, the acceleration is incredible. The handling is so balanced with acceleration and cornering that is way out of its class. I could go on and on about what a great car this is but all I can say is this was my first Audi S5 series, it will not be my last. What a shame DRIVING THIS CAR WAS GREAT.The major problem is the trim at the bottom of the door that hits you in the bottom of your calf when entering. This item kept me from buying the Audi S5 Not so sporty The S5 Sportback is a pretty large car. It has loads of power,torque and tech,but it feels kind of unathletic and not much road connectivity. The steering is uncommunicative. It’s hard to feel the perimeter of the car and thus it’s hard to park. In a word - WOW Owned the S5 Sportback for 3 days and absolutely blown away with performance, sound (of both car and B &O Stereo system) appearance and ease of use of infotainment system.  Far easier to comprehend than Lexus GS system that I’m still trying to figure out after 3 years. Nice car... Great car - great ride - nice value Disappoint at price point Features that are standard on Japanese competitors are extra cost options on the Audi. Although the base price is attractive getting the S5 out the door makes it a very poor value proposition. On top of that the dealers do not want to discount this model therefore they sit on the lot. Looking elsewhere for better values. Love this car! I love the way this car handles and the quality and technology are excellent. I previously owned a Lexus and this is my first Audi. His car has exceeded my expectations! Super satisfied More than enough horsepower.  Handling is great A little dissappointed from Audi. After 30,000 miles on the car I believe I can say my review hasn’t changed very much. I am disappointed that mechanical problems have started. I rarely open the convertible top due to the hot climates in my area, however I have noticed there is unusual wear at all the fold points of the Root top fabric. In addition,I have noted some peeling paint Around the doorhandles. I brought this to the attention of the local Audi dealer and they refused to do anything about it claiming that it was not significant enough yet. I asked them what would be significant enough and they said we can’t tell you that. For a premium car, at a premium price, in a premium brand, that is just absolutely unacceptable in my opinion? I received a tutorial from a dealership in Charlotte North Carolina, not my own dealership, regarding enhancing the performance of the vehicle through the settings. This certainly did improve the acceleration and some of the performance, but I believe the car still feels more luxurious and smooth than sporty. It remains sluggish to rev up and acts like you are asking a lot to get up and run.  Not ready for a hot-lap on the track like the F-Type that feels like hopped up on espresso and biting it\\'s nails to go everytime you start it. I still feel is not enough trunk space for a golf bag, couple tennis rackets fit fine. Handling is still very nice and crisp and the steering has a very connected tight feel that almost does what you think, very BMW-esque. Ride is still very quiet with almost no noise. Very tied down cabin.  I have found that the lack of a microphone and hands-free is really unsafe and cumbersome and a large disappointment...really??  My $30k Toyota Truck has voice command AND a touch Screen?! The Audi also lacks front parking sensors And with a nose that extends far beyond the front wheels, this is often a problem with curbs. Now, many of those complaints are relatively minor, compared to problems I’ve had with other vehicles. But the mediocre sports performance of the vehicle combined with its high price tag and the lack of support from my local dealership in this premium brand really leaves me disappointed about the vehicle. I would seek to trade in the vehicle, but I found out even a more for Disappointing fact. Despite the vehicle being somewhat rare and not very common, its resale value has plummeted since purchase. I believe I will look to other premium brands such as Lexus  with increasingly disappointing service provided by the German automobile makers. Watch out when you buy a CPO Audi Car is great but watch out when buying a CPO AUDI.  I recently purchased a CPO S5 Convertible I was told that the car was not in an accident the car-fax was clean but when I got home I noticed the front end was misaligned. I ran an auto check and found out that it was in an accident. the dealer took back the car but its now reselling it CPO and acting like its perfect. Initially I thought it was an honest mistake but know I know better. I called Audi to complain but was told that CPO cars can be certified even if they are in an accident. I am fine with that but it should be disclosed to the consumer.<br><br><br><br> It doesn\\'t get much better! July 2018:  Still flawless.January 2017 update:  I still absolutely love the car!  I don\\'t put a lot of mileage on my S5 but it has has no maintenance issues and is a delight to drive.  Finally, my son liked mine so much that he went out and bought an S5 coupe! There remains only one item I wish was different - there are no front parking assist sensors on the S5.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this is not standard or at least offered as an option as even A3 cabriolet has them. The color, Sepang Blue Pearl, is awesome and I constantly get compliments on it.  In addition, just as on our Q5, the paint job is FLAWLESS - not a touch of \"orange-peel\" anywhere.July 2016 Update:  Since we do most of our longer trips in the wife\\'s 2013 Q5,  the S5 Cabriolet has just 12,100 miles to date.  The car has run flawlessly, looks showroom new and continues to draw admiring comments wherever I take it.  Worth noting - I cannot get a definitive answer on best tire pressure.  When I inflated them to the factory-recommended (sticker and owner\\'s manual) pressure of 39/38psi the ride becomes a little too harsh for my liking.  I reduced the pressures to 36psi all around and the ride was better with no perceptible degradation in handing.  Also, I wish Audi would come up with a better composition for their brake pads - I bought a pressure washer to deal with the constant accumulation of black brake dust on my wheels - almost as bad as my old Bimmer.  I\\'m not at this point yet but when our Q5 said it needed brake pad replacement - Audi would not turn the rotors!  This strikes me as ridiculous and made a simple brake pad replacement job cost over $1,300.  I may not go to Audi when my pads need replacement.Having said all that,I still love my S5 Cabriolet! A Perfect AWD Convertible  love car, quick and dependable very attractive convertible , canvas top goes down an out of the way in one motion.  no need to push levers or snaps, just the button to lower the top which can be done while moving.   For safety has hidden roll bars which pop up if the car is headed over.  Also quattro drive which makes rain driving safer.  Wind screen makes top down driving very much like driving with a huge sun roof.  one problem back seat is not useable with the screen deployed.  Another caution, the front valance is just a few inches off the ground so easily scraped if you  get to the curb. A lot to offer but with a couple of compromises I\\'ve owned my 2013 for almost one year.What\\'s not to like:1.AWD2.All season QUIET convertible rag top3.Google MapsBut there are compromises.The connectivity in the car requires a paid T-Mobile subscription.And even with that you only receive limited, general information.You won\\'t receive personal data from the internet of any kind.And seriously, who needs a hotspot in a car these days since most everyone is carrying their smart phones?In an age where a Chrysler has a full touch screen with data shared through a phone Audi falls way short in the tech department. Amazing Car I have had this car for 4 weeks now, and it is still impressing me.The power is smooth and strong, it comes on early and just keeps puling hard.Very addictive.Handling, is well not as brilliant as my old BMW 330CI, but it is still exceptionaly good. This car is very fun to drive and did I mention it has gobs of smooth power.The quality of the finish, both inside and outside is superb.Initially I was not sure about the alcantara seat inserts, but now that I have the alcantara, I am 100% sold and glad to have it.It\\'s superior, both in looks and function and very easy to clean, just wipe with a damp cloth.It\\'s hard to believe someone would pay extra to not get the alcantara.  Wow Just took delivery of 2013 S5 - wow.I have been waiting for the V6 in the S5 coupe and it does not disappoint.The power is smooth and plentiful.Gearbox is amazing, and while the sound may not be a V8, it makes plenty of fun noises.The ride is firm for sure, but well damped - car does not crash over bumps and handles uneven pavement well.The MMI system cleaned up from my 2011 A6, but I am still on the fence with the aerial photos from Google Earth - almost feels a little cluttered.B&O stereo is okay - not that impressed. Overall, an indulgent purchase.No one is going to say this is good value for $, but if you want fun in a gorgeous package - an S5 is it! 7 years hundred and twenty thousand miles and neve I have owned my S5 since November 2009 and have driven it a hundred and twenty thousand miles both Highway and City driving. The car looks as good today as it did when I first got it. But more importantly the car drives as well today as it did when I first got it acceleration and hides high speed drivability is great. I plan on holding onto it until the new 2018 model comes out. I recommend it for a while. New 2010 S5 convertible This is our third Audi convertible and this new S5 is a Superior car to the other two S4 convertibles we had. From the engine performance to the shape of the mirrors. Great car. Just not as fast as our 2009 BMW 335i coupe. More Luxurious than My Vette Having been a vette owner for years-the price of the new ones compared with new technology being introduced by other automakers made me look in a different direction. I drove new Corvettes, MB, Infiniti, and Lexus. When I finally drove the Audi S5 Cabriolet-I knew it was time to change. The style, the punch of the supercharged engine, the interior design, the technology Audi offers and the limited availability of the S5 Cab made me want one. It is roomy, enough power to cruise with some fun, sounds great and the tech gadgets are incredible. Awesome I just purchased this car and absolutely love it.Everything is what you would expect and more from a premuim performance coupe.The major defining factor in choosing this car was when I heard the engine start; knew at this point that I had to have it.It is understated and over performing, but people can\\'t take their eyes off of it.Another very nice feature is that you don\\'t see many on the road. 3600 sold in the entire country last year.If you are considering one, their is no reason to hold back! Very Sexy Car I was a die hard Lexus owner but saw the S5 at the airport and knew I had to have one.It is the sexiest car I have ever seen and people literally turn their heads everywhere I go.I live the Dallas area and have only seen 3 other S5s on the road since I purchased it 8 months ago.The dealership had already added Stasis (something I otherwise would not have paid for but my husband loves it) and the engine roar is unbelievable.Coming from a very quiet Lexus, the engine noise seemed a little loud at first but now I don\\'t even hear it anymore.I\\'m a fairly aggressive driver and absolutely love the handling and overall maneuverability of this car. Just bought the S5 I bought the Audi S5 last month.  I was torn between waiting for the supercharged V6, or getting the V8.  After all of my research, I discovered, that the V6 will be on average 2-3 miles per gallon more efficient.  Which if you drive 15,000 miles a year, and extrapolate over a 5 year car ownership averages to about $2000 saved for the V6.  I chose the V8 because I test drove both engines, and the V8 just sounds better, feels better, and I personally like feeling the gears change and shift, because it makes me feel that I am driving a rocket.  The car is beautiful, handles superbly, the interior is well- appointed, and looks great.  The MMI did require some learning, but I\\'m good with it now.  A Gentleman\\'s Muscle Car I\\'ve previously driven an A4,S4,BMW 3 series. Although the new S4 is marginally faster on the track, the combination of elegance, beauty, performance, solid build quality and a refined, ergonomic interior that matches (if not exceeds) competitors makes the S5 the ideal coupe for the affluent consumer desiring a...well frankly speaking a flashy daily driver. Short of the R8, this is the best overall handling production Audi. 0-60 times as follows: 4.9 (standstill), 4.7 with S-mode, 4.5 with a 1 foot roll out in S-mode. 24-26 mpg highway. A great ride Considered M3 - but this S5 is an overall awesome car. Great looks, ride, handling. Love it.  Dream Car Purchased my new S5 Quatro Coupe about 30 days ago. Drove the BMW5, and Mercedes E class as well. I knew within 0.5 mi  of the dealership that this was the one for me. I can\\'t begin to express how much fun and nice this car is both to look at and drive. The handling in the corners is tight and responsive. In sport mode, the acceleration is enough to throw you back in the seats. On appearance, the angry look outside looks like it\\'s moving even while standing still. The interior is a wonderful blend of colors and quality textures that make me never want to get out. From my constant smile, my wife thinks I am having an affair, - but at least it is with a car!  perfect... Traded an 08 s4 for it. Was shopping for a 911 or m3.  This s5 is the perfect marriage of a luxury car and a sports car.  I get continuous thumbs up at stoplights.  Its funny.  The m3 is faster. But it looks like every 2 door BMW on the road.  The 911 is great. But just didn\\'t fit me.  The s5 is a dual personality. Gorgeous machine.  I can say that the I found my perfect car.   Get it before they change the engine to a v6.  This will be the last v8. Unless you go to the rs4. Which will be a 25k premium.   Get \\'em while they last, they will be hard to get and will keep their value for years to come.    Heads won\\'t stop turning to look at S5! If you want to keep a low profile and go un-noticed then, this is NOT the car to drive.I inherited enough money in Jan. 2010 to be able to buy me this car with cash in March 2010. I knew I wanted a Luxury/Sport Coupe, and narrowed it down to this or the Infiniti G37.Deciding factor for me was the way the Audi S5 Coupe felt while driving it. This car demands the attention of everyone within view with its sensory charged design and gadget options. Love the rims that came on the car but have already scraped them on two curbs. My auto insurance also increased from $145.00 per month premium to $414.00 per month. But, Its Worth It! Hoped the Convertible was AWD though! Handling is beautiful I just got my S5in nov and what a purchase. The roar of the engine is awesome, the car loves to be driven fast, I have to keep a close eye on the speedometer, or before you know you\\'re doing 100 no problem. The drive and handling is beautiful except that silly sunroof, I\\'ll live though, I don\\'t recommend this car because I don\\'t want to see too many on the road. Just kidding get one. You won\\'t be disappointed My first Audi and this car is awesome!  The S5 is worth the extra $.  Great sound, performance, style and handling.  I\\'ve only had for 1 month so far, but all is good.  The \"new\" navi system & tech pkg is nice and my two kids are fine with back seat area (rare for a coupe).  The only option I ordered was the \"Prestige Pkg\".  I\\'m not a track guy but I do enjoy performance driving.  I\\'ve heard good things about Spt Diff, Drv Select, and Drv Asst pkgs as well.  This is my 1st Tiptronic (all previous cars were 6sp) and I like the \"sport option\" shift mode as well as the \"paddle shifting\".  I\\'m through the break in period and the car is a delight to drive.  It\\'s my daily driver, no regrets. Best of the Lot This is my 4th Audi. First 3 were A6s & the last two were 4.2L S-Line.  Each Audi I\\'ve owned was better than the last one and this is no exception. This is a stunning, head-turning vehicle, inside and out.   Mine is Canyon Red, no longer standard and special ordered, but, as I love the color, worth every extra penny.  It has driver assist, which also alerts one about cars in the blind spot, sports differential, and drive select; highly recommend all 3 and the latter 2 enhance performance.  Loads of fun, responsive as all get out, and very comfortable even on 6 hr trips.  Gas drinker, mainly due to a smaller tank but I get 27 on the road.  I tried BMW M3 & 6-Series Coupe. This is nicer. MOST VERSATILE LUXURY CAR EVER I wanted a nice car that was fun to drive that could be a daily driver and was a convertible.  The Audi S5 is that, and more!After test driving BMW, Audi, and Jaguar, I was on the fence between BMW and Audi.  The Audi just “felt” more fun to drive.  The BMW had a better entertainment system and better fuel economy.  Also, the Audi was slightly more expensive; telling me it had better resale.  The other thing that made me choose Audi was the Adaptive Cruise Control option.  BMW doesn’t have this option on many of their convertibles, and it was easier to find an Audi with one.  I am so glad I did!  What a great feature to have if you drive highways frequently.After 7 weeks with this car, it is more than perfect, if you can say that.  It is a high performance speed demon if you want, with a great exhaust sound and rally inspired handling.  If you want a leisurely cruise with the top down, you can have that too.  It does drink a little more gas than I was expecting, but the smiles per mile more than make up for it.  Traction hasn’t been an issue, and I can’t wait to try it in snow.The main issues I’ve had are with the entertainment system.  The Homelink garage door opener has not worked a few times. (I literally jumped in the OTHER car I have with it, pushed the button, and door went down on the first try.  After returning home, the Audi Homelink worked fine.) The “MMI” Nav screen has become “stuck” on a screen before after using the reverse camera.  I had to push the Media or Nav button to get it un-stuck, so not too bad of an issue.  One morning after putting the top down, a window kept going to 25% closed while the rest were 100%.  I had to manually use the window button on that door to get it to stay up.  The cord to connect your phone or iPod to the Nav system is a pain, as it is in the glove box.  Instead, I bought a 16GB SD card for $10 on Amazon and play all my music that way with one of two SD slots.  The Bluetooth for answering calls and playing music is flawless, however.  I very much prefer the non-touch screen in the Audi vs the touch screen in the BMW.   UPDATE: I have not had any issues with any of these systems since the dealer updated the MMI 6 months ago.Driving with the top up, it feels like a normal car.  The road noise can be elevated at times, which is because it is a cloth top.  A Mustang driver rode in my car and noted that the road noise was much less than theirs.  The AC cools very fast, creating a cool atmosphere on a hot day (95F) with the setting at 76F.  The ventilated seats cool quite quickly, but I am beginning to think they are more of a gimmick than worth the extra money.If you are buying strictly for performance, you might be a little disappointed with the vehicle stability and throttle response.  You can feel a lot of vehicle sway when cornering on a rough road, and many people install a rigid bar across the engine bay to reduce body sway.  The throttle is not responsive unless in sport mode, which is quite punchy and hurts drivability a bit.In addition, the looks of this car are unique and stylish.  Not too aggressive or over the top, but smooth lines and well-designed features.  Even with the release of the redesigned 2018 model, this one doesn’t look out of date.Overall, this car is a pleasure to drive and look at.  You won’t be disappointed in buying, although maintenance is slightly more expensive when items fail, the reliability has been fantastic.  If you came to this page to find the perfect car, this is the ONE!UPDATE: After driving this car for 14 months, I like it even more.  I\\'ve put almost 32K miles on it with no mechanical issues.  Even changed the tires and it didn\\'t need an alignment.  I think the performance is better than I originally thought.  Keeping the car in Dynamic mode helps the stability in cornering quite a bit.  I drove it on slick and icy roads without any issues.  The entertainment system had a few sporadic problems, but an update to the system by the dealer took care of them.  I found out gas mileage can drastically improve with driving habits, haha. Overall, still very happy with my purchase. Little Audi Red Convertible  Love my Audi S5 Great power and comfortable driving experience.  Beautiful exterior and interior.  We receive compliments on it weekly at grocery stores, gas stations, etc.  The car is a real head turner.  Would definitely purchase again. Love this Car.... I was in the market for a car that has a reliable track record, is fun, luxurious and a looker.  My first choice was a Porsche 911 C4S but I couldn\\'t justify the expense (that is code for too steep of a price).  So, why did I go this route? The audi S5 that has been in the market for a while.  Yet, you don\\'t see very many on the road.  It\\'s sexy, is quick and agile.  It does have its limits as it is not \"an all out\" sports car but a luxury GT Coupe. Fun Factor and great looks: I thoroughly enjoy the ride quality and quickness.  Quality of the interior is above board.  Wow, it a reliable rendition of what a GT coupe should be.2018 Update: 22k miles - still love this car.  Garage kept.   Car looks good in caparison to others on the road. Beauty This car is handsome and powerful and a little tight on interior space. Great for two people, maybe three. 2016 audi s5  Great Car With a Big Problem After jumping to the S5 model from the Audi A5, I wondered why I hadn\\'t done it sooner.  The difference is remarkable, both in performance, as well as an overall graduation to nicer interior stylings, technology and engineering. With the beast 333 hp supercharged engine under the hood, the acceleration from a dead stop was palpable, if not downright enjoyable. Outer stylings will certainly turn heads, as the car jumps off the page demonstrating elegance with an understated sportiness, particularly with the hardtop coupe model.  The technology and dashboard layout can be both intimidating and frustrating, for example many controls are dash mounted, consequently, its important to learn where everything is prior to getting in it and spinning around town. Sadly, in my case, the vehicle has only 18,000 km on it over two years, and paint is flaking off in large 25cent size pieces from the rocker panels on both sides of the car (where you would expect the paint to never fall off). I have notified the dealer in Mississauga, Ontario in this case, who recommended I go to Audi Canada, since it was out of their hands. I have contacted Audi Canada about the issue and they are unwilling to do anything about it citing road damage. I live in the city, drive the car infrequently on paved roads only, and do not drive the car in winter (as I spend my time in the south).Quite frankly, I am surprised by Audi\\'s reluctance to do anything about it, since I am a repeat buyer, which is prompting me to look elsewhere when I replace my car in another year or so. However, when I do drive the Audi S5, the flaking paint is a good advertisement for the poor quality paint Audi has put on my car and anyone who asks, I tell them the problem. Other than that, defer to my earlier comments about performance, and its highly recommended vehicle if you don\\'t mind the paint falling off it. Fantastic Daily driver Going on over a year and this is still a great car with no issues. Great car, it is comfortable in every way, super quiet, great reliability, AWD, sexy looks, and feels like you get your money worth. I drove several BMW\\'s before going with this car and even the 2013 BMW\\'s didn\\'t feel like it was worth the money. I got in this car and I immediately felt like it was in a class above the BMW\\'s. You feel sexy getting in it and I have had it for 8 months and it still gives me the same feeling. I have the 6 speed manual and wouldn\\'t want it another way. Only thing I would like to mention is if you are a purist and love to feel connected to the road then this isn\\'t the car for you. This coupe is not a sports car but more of a luxury touring car. Couldn\\'t Ask for More! What a great car to own and drive.  I looked at the new M3, AWD250, 335Xi. This is a great daily driver - even though Minnesota winters thanks to AWD. Handles great and performs like a dream.  Not to mention the downright serene exhaust note. Suspension is firm enough to eat up the turns, but soft enough to not leave you bruised upon arrival. Great GT cruiser. Getting MUCH better MPG than the sticker claims even with fairly aggressive driving. B&O Sound system is great and a must have add on.  Every time I get in this car I\\'m glad I went with the S5. A great blend of performance and fun  - yet supply enough to be a daily driver.  Now an Audi convert! (past cars MB E5004matic) Chicago S5 Have had my S5 for almost a year.  Still love it every time I get in. Great overall experience.  This is my 4th Audi: A8, 2 S4s and now S5.  My favorite overall.  Greatly improved fit/finish compared to my 2 S4s. Great in snow with high-performance snow tires.  I would buy this car again without hesitation.  Enjoying it too much to worry  about mileage.  I didn\\'t get it for the mileage. Still like to just look at it after a year-great design. The Perfect Automobile The Audi S5 is the perfect all-around all weather car. In the time leading up to my purchase I drove the new M3, RS4, A5 and S4. The S5 is the perfect combination of performance, comfort, style, features and audible pleasure. I loved driving the M3 and was close to deciding on that car but I was a little worried about RWD in the northern Wisconsin winters that can make driving even an AWD car a challenge 6-8 months out of the year. After nearly three weeks with the S5 I can say I am thrilled with all aspects of the Audi. I disagree with people on the MPG, for a car of this type, the MPG is great. I drove 200+ highway miles today and got 23mpg. That is up from 19mpg in the 1st 1000miles.  I have named her Gemini. So far, so great.  I traded a 2007 A6 4.2 for this S5  I have driven a few cars in the last three months, A5, new M3 and my S5.  The S5 is the perfect blend of performance, comfort, style, quality and all weather security. I really liked the M3 but was nervous about the Wisconsin winters and RWD. Then I saw the S5 in person, drove it and fell in love.   Classy/sporty/unique grand tourer Took delivery back in late jan 2008. Have logged close to 2500 miles in mixed driving. Car handles phenomenally and is a head turner wherever I go. Build quality is impeccable, interior design and exterior styling make this one unique car.  Also looked at the 335xi but the audi interior was more aesthetically pleasing, this layout is very driver centric. Although the car is heavy handling is precise and the car feels like it\\'s on rails, especially in the twisties where it simply attacks the corners. Biggest downside is the v8 gas gulper but the car is such a joy to drive that the sub par gas mileage becomes bearable. All show and plenty of  go! I have had my Audi for about 3 weeks and have had many positive comments about the car. I will say this is my first Audi but I am overall a lover of cars, owning everything from SUV\\'s to American Muscle cars to Japanese rides such as the G-35 coupe. Positives-The S5 is an excellent ride, not too rough for a sports car, ergonomics are great, V-8 is very responsive in all gears. Day time running lights turn countless heads. I-pod integration a must. Spacious trunk. Tight handling. Negatives- electronic speed limited. No voice activated Bluetooth. Horrible gas mileage. No standard all season high performance tires.  S5 The bluetooth may bring some connection headaches...but it\\'s a hell of a machine. Key functions may also not be as well connected. Nonetheless, very comfortable and extremely smooth in gear shifting. It has an awesome shape and look to it. The base is low so parking and going thru dips may scratch the front bottom bumper A stupid car - but in a fun way I live in the Chicago area so my initial concerns were: a) what do I do if it snows and b) the gas mileage ain\\'t pretty.  As for the snow - of which we saw a near record amount this year - the S5 drives exceptionally well. I dumped the summer performance tires within hours of picking up the car replacing them with high performance all seasons. The car\\'s power is so easy that driving slow in rough conditions is easy.  The gas mileage is terrible. 750 miles, many more to go This is my third Audi and by far the most fun to drive.  I\\'ve owned a 2000 A4 2.8 Avant and 2006 A3 2.0T and this upholds the Audi reputation for excellent interiors and beautiful exterior design. This car is beautiful by looks and in driving. The growl of the V8 had me from the start, but sitting inside you get to appreciate the attention to car-driver intuitive design. The six-speed manual has a nice feel, but 1st can be a bit abrupt, but it\\'s a bit new so too early to judge. Gas mileage is a definite concern (~12-22mpg), but only time will tell. Easiest $60K choice I\\'ve ever made! To be a first time Audi owner with a 2008 S5 is the best car experience I\\'ve ever had.  The car is absolutely stunning from any angle and light setting.  I have soccer moms looking at the car at stop lights!  Not very easy to get used to I might add.  The performance and V8 sound more than equal its stunning looks.  Interior Fit and Finish are Audi\\'s best, and the MMI is easy to use and informational.  The Bang & Olufsen stereo is amazing, but its usually muted since I love hearing the V8 engine noises inside the cabin, and also with the windows down.     Well integrated, what a motor! This is my 17th car, following just about everything but Audi (Porsche 928 and 996 Turbo, SL500, BMW 735, and assorted Ford and Chevy cars). Hands down, this is the best automotive execution I have driven. I\\'m a nut for picking apart failed user interfaces (my job), and this car has not disappointed me, however I\\'m only about 75% familiar with it after 400 miles. MMI is a bit complicated, so the Driver Information System and steering wheel controls are fabulous; you can do 90% of what you need very quickly, intuitively, and with eyes forward. IPod integration, including playlist support, is great, and will save lives. The motor and drivetrain is wonderful. 600 miles into my S5 Being the 1st review means I haven\\'t had it long enough to really have good answer to some question. Went in for an A6/R6, was shown this \"one and only\" by a friend and 5 min later it was mine. This car is as nice to drive and it is to look at. The DI V8 has such a unique sound at first I though there was a miss, but it\\'s growing on me. Waiting for more mileage to go stand on it. Quick checks tell me that MPG is 22+/- if your on the road. This is a 6 speed and love the way it shifts. If I had the option I would have got the automatic but would have to wait for 4-5 months and maybe not in a S5? Audi has nailed the perfect car! Until recently I have owned and driven BMWs, the most recent being a 330 xi. That was the last Bimmer I will ever buy, Audi has converted me to a loyal and longterm fan. I have been curious of Audi as a brand for some time and the look of the new S5 was what it took to get me to go and have a closer look. Wow. S5 first 2k miles I\\'ve always wanted a 993/996/997 BUT need a back seat that can accommodate a baby seat.  The S5 has plenty of room for 3 adults and a large baby seat. It\\'s very comfortable, has all wheel drive (go to YouTube and check out the S5 racing a down hill skier, the car goes up and down the slope!) and has similar stats to a 997 4.  0-60 4.9 S5 vs 4.8 997 4 and 1/4 13.2 S5 vs. 13/12.9 997 4.  The 6 speed gear box is not quite as nice as the 997 but is still easy to shift.  Anyway this is a great sport GT/luxury sports car.  It sticks to the pavement, drives GREAT in the rain and is very comfortable. We\\'ll see how it does over the next 90k miles, but I am very happy with the first 2k miles.   Great but can be improved. First of all to all those who think this care is fast I hate to break it to you but it\\'s not. I shelled out close to 63 thousand dollars and I could have bought a Z06. Now on the other hand the looks are great and I love the handling. Since last november minor things have gone wrong with the car(electrical/led lighting etc). Audi should have built a faster car. I guess that\\'s why they are coming up with the RS5 for 85K! My Thoughts S5 is indeed a beautiful car.  I just got it, but I must say it is not that great of a car.  I own an M5 2007 so there is a big difference in performance.  When driving you must step on the gas more due to the quattro system.  When you release you will feel a slight deceleration which makes people think you are braking but you are not.  The handling is not as nice due to the really light wheel.  I do not get any feedback like when I drive rear wheel cars.  You will notice it the most when you drive on twisty roads.  I do understeer on turns since the line of entry is a little different with this car.  Great car for everyday drive but for performance the 335i can boogie against this car.   Amazing! I\\'ve owned my new S5 for two weeks now...test drove everything (many, many times) from the 335i, Cayenne GTS, M3, G37, 650i, others..and yes, this was the winner.  First, let me mention it looks phenomenal in person, way better than in pictures and better than anything else under $100k.  I\\'ve found the V8 is perfectly robust and yet sumptuous, and the acceleration is long and powerful in any gear. The interior made my former 3-series feel outdated instantly.  This is a perfect touring GT where the M3 is a sports car, and that touch of gentleman is exactly what I was looking for. Awesome Bought my US Spec Auto S5 over here in Stuttgart Germany.  The 1st 600 miles break in period was hard to do on the autobahn.  I have slowly stepped it up since and will not really see what it can do until I have passed the 2500 mile mark.  All and all so far it has been everything I have expected.  A few things I have noted are that the IPOD option does not come with an IPOD adaptor!  Seats are a 6 on long trips due to comfort and I have noticed that the tires seem a little narrow over 100 mph.  If you need to do an emergency slow down, the back end seems to want to get away from you but the ESP kicks in and keeps it under control.  Overall I still give it a 9. Best Daily Driver This car is by far the best daily driver.  My last car was a Porsche 997 S Cab and before that a BMW E46 M3 Cab.  Unless you are going to take this car to a race track it outshines the others.  It is way more comfortable and had great Cabin Tech.  Ipod integration is outstanding as is the B&O Sound System.  If you are looking for a fast, sporty, great looking daily driver look no further.  Compared to other German cars with this level of performance it is also a good value.  There are not many of these on the road in my area and the car gets a lot of attention. My S5 Let me start by saying that I have test driven a lot of cars before finally choosing the S5. I have ordered mine and I got it about 8 months later. Mine is a red interior on black exterior. I have had the car for less than two months now. What do I think? I absolutely love the car. I love the style, performance, stability and exclusivity. I live in downtown San Diego and I have not seen any other S5 yet. I keep getting all kinda compliments on the car. Most importantly, I really enjoy the ride and the power. How about the MPG? I do not give a damn!!! I always find excuses to drive it around. Who cares about the mileage when the car is soo much fun to drive?? Black Pearl & Red Magna From what I can see, although, it is quite early, this car is a definite keeper. I have to laugh when I read some reviews commenting on the MPG\\'s. Guys, it\\'s posted right there on the sticker. If you do not agree with something, don\\'t buy it! What a great mix of luxury and performance. I looked at, and test drove most everything in the S5\\'s class, and, I don\\'t think that any one car touched it. You have to love the exclusivity of it, too. I have yet to see one on the road, and I live in a fairly large city.  That darn sunroof I\\'ve only had my car for a few months but here\\'s my take. There has to be something they can do to the roof to help me have a open air feeling to that car. The city mileage is terrible, highway with cruise 23 to 24 not bad.  But I don\\'t know why they can\\'t do better, my E500 averaged 21 and I saw a high of 27 in a car that had over 300 hp and was bigger.  I wish the transmission helped with the city driving. Yes the car is fast, but am I the only one who thinks this car want to go ballistic on the highway.  Not that I\\'m complaining I just wish the 0-60 matched the height a bit more.   fast and refined  Had considered an M3. After I drove the S5 Cab there was no turning back. The interior blows you away compared to the BMW. My dealer suggested an ECU upgrade pushing the car to 410 HP with 370 lb-ft of tqe. The car is as you can imagine super fast. Zero to 60 4.3 seconds. Right there with the M. Big difference is the quatro. Makes the car stick to the road like glue. BMW to Audi After owning a BMW 335 Cab for 3 years I could not wait to get back to Audi. The BMW was nice but with the Rub Flats and turbo problems run away from this car. BMW still has the take it or leave it attitude. Everything with BMW is normal, it takes a law suit to wake them up. It\\'s a shame after 6 BMWs since 1999 I would never own another one again. The best driving experience is ruined by the Run Flats!  BWM-and back to Audi After leaving Audi in 2001 because of the lousy dealership and service in my old hometown I went over to BMW. Well after 5 BMWs and the last being a 335 cab with what I would say the worst tires in the world  ( Run Flats) I went back to Audi. Well all I can say is the S5 Cab is worlds ahead of BMW in REAL would driving. Fit is finish is flawless. The MMI system and Navigation is world ahead of BMW\\'s I drive and very easy to use. I have had dozens of high end cars and this one gets more attention than anything I have had. Super quite, plenty of power and the best seats I have ever sat in. I have one problem with the car, I just want to wax it and look at it it\\'s that nice.  It is SOOOOO good Ok .... I expect if you are like me, you are reading these reviews to sway you one way or another between different brands. Stop reading, man up, drop the coin and do it.Yeah, the gas mileage isn\\'t great but does that matter?You don\\'t get a V8 for free.It\\'s sexy, fun, fast, reliable and did I mention fun.By far the best car I\\'ve ever owned. Audi S 5 I have owned a BMW, Acura, Infinity and Land Rover, I have to say that this Audi S5 is the best car I have ever owned! The engineering, performance, and technology is superior. As well it is a blast to drive. 1st time Audi owner I recently traded a 08 BMW m3 sedan for a 2011 S5 and I am thrilled!!While the m3 is a fantastic car, it is not a fantastic everyday car. I made the switch because of the s5\\'s seductive good looks, v8 power, and 4 wheel grip.The s5 interior is stunning visually and very user friendly (BMW Idrive is a mess!)The seats are extremely comfortable and infinitely adjustable.The B&O sound system is fantastic, and would say on par with the best from BMW.Behind the wheel; great steering feel, engine power is substantial but not overwelming. Overall build quality and materials are excellent.My only grips are: the pano roof only vents and the overhead sunglass compartment is tiny! I love my s5 I just got this car a few weeks ago, but I am in love with it.  I traded in a Nissan GTR because the ride was very rough. I wanted something a little more refined and comfortable and still wanted to keep some of the performance.  I love this car! Awesome car Beautiful car inside and out and what a joy to drive.  Handles so confidently and smoothly. I also looked at BMW 335iX coupe (no camera and too harsh style), Mercedes E coupe (no 4-wheel option). The extra power over the A5 changes the car considerably.  You don\\'t go wrong if you pick this car. Second one - Might go for a third Its mechanics are identical to a Volkwagen GTI. But its lower, has more room in back, and a much nicer image. They burn a lot of oil, so keep an eye on the dip stick. Do run the VINs and check if its had the Intake Cam & High output fuel pump worked on - They denied issues until hundreds of angry villagers stormed the castle with Pitch Forks and torches. They finally gave in and admitted they hired the wrong company to provide the additional mechanicals. I actually had to have them do it twice (on my o9), as the first time, they didn\\'t bolt something to spec and it began having problems within a couple of weeks - VWoA spent over $6k on that engine, but the top end has a 100,000 mile warranty now.  Second one (\\'12) has been a champ, but the local Dealer is not the best. Amazing Vehicle Best car I have ever owned and driven.  It exceeds my expectations.  It’s the quietest convertible I’ve ever been in and the digital cockpit will blow you away. so far so good. It looks  great and drives well.! Check out exact features of each car before buying. Each car has different features which aren\\'t always explained. Great Luxury Value Fun to Drive, great styling, quality interior Love my A3 I love this car. I leased a 2015 A3 base model, and loved it so much I upgraded to a 2017 Premium Quattro.  Although it is a little small for my husband\\'s comfort (he\\'s 6\\'2\") I am completely comfortable in the car.  I feel safe and secure.  I hope to own this car for a very long time. Very impressed with my Audi A3 2.0T Quattro Overall this is an impressive \"little\" luxury car.  The car handles and rides extremely well.  It goes exactly where you point it and the ride is smooth and very quite.  The engine performance and handling are very refined.  The feel of the leather wrapped steering wheel and leather seats are amazing.  The sound system and infotainment system are excellent, but take some time to get familiar with.  I do not like the engine start/stop system, but I am glad you can turn it off.   Overall this is a great compact luxury car that I look forward to driving everyday and looking back at after I park it. Luxury in a smaller package I LOVE my new Audi A3!!  Beautiful to look at ( I have the Cosmos Blue with chestnut)....and SO FUN to drive.  With 220 hp, it has excellent pick up and speed, beautiful sound from the Bang and Olefsun stereo system...and the VIRTUAL COCKPIT is AMAZING!!  From a BMW to a Mercedes... now to my AUDI....love it. The best damn little car I ever had! If you want to turn heads, a great ride, and affordability, this is the car for you. When I say great ride, I mean great ride. It hugs the road. It\\'s almost as if the car is saying, \"Let me show you what I can do\". I was on the highway one afternoon, and the engine was purring like a much contented cat, when I glanced at the tach, and it was around 2000rpms. Then, I looked over to the speedometer, and I doing close to 90mph. It\\' just that smooth. Of course I slowed down, but jeez! Curves, cake. Passing, let\\'s go. When you get in, you feel pampered, but not overwhelmed. The controls and appointments are laid out in a pleasing and thoughtful manner. Yes, the trunk is small, but are you really going to throw 100 pounds of mulch back there? Didn\\'t think so. I looked at the Mercedes CLA-4 MATIC, and the Cadillac ATS, but neither came close. If you like to drive as much as I do, drive the Audi A3. New A3 a winner Many trim levels to choose from.  Pays to go up one level for power to both front seats and even Navigation.  No memory seat available for Premium trim.  Great  engine,.  Start stop engine technology still has issues  fro some reason.  Can disable it . Best interior in its class I own this car less than a month so ratings for some items are N/A. No memory seats combined with smaller door openings make getting in and setting up a little inconvenient. The AWD eats up 2-3 CF of trunk space. Car is very well made. Layout of controls is very logical - European logical, and that is a good thing. Best feature - Virtual cockpit. All my nav, media, and car info can also be displayed and controlled independently in front of me in addition to the Nav screen in the center. The center Nav screen retracts into the dash which is better than the more expensive BMW, and Mercedes which have an afterthought I-Pad glued onto the dash. I recommend this car6.07.17 - after 6 months and about 1,800 miles - PERFECT. nuff said. The best there is Look at used Audi’s as the a 4 conv. The new ones depreciate quickly. Audi owners take care of their cars, so it’s hard to go wrong. Wifey LovesHer Ragtop Looked for a convertible for her for over a year -- Mustang, Camaro, BMW Z4, Lexus, etc and none of them seemed to fit the bill of what we wanted -- namely, high build quality, decent onroad performance and technology, a usable backseat, for under $40,000. We found it in a leftover 2015 model A3 2.0 Quattro Cabriolet. I have driven it some, quite impressed with its (front seat) legroom, smooth ride & handling, and giddy-up, esp. when you drop it into Sport mode. Gets lots of positive comments from onlookers.Note: Don\\'t expect to get 33 MPG, it\\'s too much fun to get into the gas, we\\'re seeing about 25 MPG overall but who cares. Also there is a learning curve on the MMI but once you figure it out it\\'s cool.6-month update: No problems whatsoever, Audis these days are highly dependable. Come on now, do your homework. I researched the A3 and test drove it a handful of times before buying it. What I don\\'t understand, therefore, are reviewers who are critical of the car (or any new car, for that matter) on things that should be obvious. Come on now, before spending your hard earned money, didn\\'t you do your homework? You complain that the seats aren\\'t heated, and the GPS is not what you like. Really? I think it\\'s one thing to have \\'failed\\' experiences, like poor reliability or gas mileage, but if you wanted certain features, why did you buy the car? That all said, the A3 is a great compact car. I love the look and feel. And features.Follow up: 6+ months/6500 miles: 2015 A3 Cabriolet still looks and runs great. No issues. Had the oil change/5k service done at the dealer. Averaging 34.5 mpg on highway, and 25mpg around town. Nice combination of power, looks and economy for a 4-passenger convertible. The retractable top folds into half of the trunk, allowing you to use the unused space for small luggage, thus making it more practical than a Mazda Miata or \\'hard top\\' cabriolet. very good cheap entry-level luxury. Loved All But A Minor Detail I LOVED this vehicle. I had it a year, leasing it. I owned it in an area with several feet of snow and even in the fwd version with factory tires she handled excellent. I honestly I had great experience and only got out of the car and did not purchase due to two things. The first was that I do not have children, and only rarely do my back seats get used. Well one day I went to open my back door and the handle fell off, this was at about 800 miles (got it with 15) on the vehicle. Since it was a lease I thought this would be an easy go in and get it fixed. Wrong. They tried charging me just to look at it - over $100 - and then said that the warranty on the vehicle would not cover this as it was wear and tear. I was in disbelief as I only had used the back door on that car a handful of times. After fighting the dealership and calling corporate, they agreed to at least look at it for free. It ended up being a very simple fix, and they didn\\'t charge me - though the bill they almost gave me was for over $300. The second was simply a cost thing. The first oil change on her was over $350. I understand other things are checked and such, but honestly the cost of the one visit was as much as my payment. I LOVED the vehicle and would definitely get another, I would just be VERY mindful of cost to own and warranty! My first Audi, and it is stellar I\\'m towards the end of a 36 month lease on a 2015 2.0 Premium A3 sedan. I have been, and continue to be very happy with this car. I wanted a small luxury sedan that was nimble and easy for city parking and was very good in snow, as i live in a major city in the northeast. I needed something easy to park. I wanted something with a simple but well appointed interior. I\\'m not partial to the Japanese luxury brand interiors, as they have so much stuff everywhere. I like clean and simple. I liked that the display could retract into the dash and the interior would be very sparse. I also wanted something that was a bit agile. I came from a VW Golf manual transmission and most automatic transmissions were slow to respond \"off the line.\" I wouldn\\'t call this fast to respond off the line, but it was preferable to me above the other luxury brands I test drove. I compared this car to Audi A4, BMW 3 series, Mercedes C300, Lexus, Inifiniti and Acura. This suited my needs the best and was most comfortable for me. I am short and it is perfect for me. This would not be a good car for a family of people over 6ft. The car has been incredibly reliable. I have not had one single issue. This car handles great and is very agile. It is very responsive for my needs. The combined MPG over 18k miles is 24MPG. I drive a combo of sport and normal mode, and do a fair bit of stop and go commuting. most of the miles are commuting miles I\\'d guess. My only issue is I wish the cargo room were a little easier accessible from the boot through the rear seats. My VW had so much more usable cargo space, but in fairness it was a hatchback. The pass-through from the boot to the rear seats is small and prohibits getting much back there. In fairness, I knew this was the case when I bought the car and it is a minimal complaint. You\\'re not going to fit any furniture in here, but you probably dont expect to. I wish there were still a hatch version of this available in the states. The standard features are great and I wouldn\\'t add a thing. I had the cold weather package added and that was it. I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a small, responsive, luxury car with solid standard features. Nimble and grippy Easy and nimble. Great pull from engine with lots of torque down low.   Smooth cruising, despite a tight suspension.  Best performance sedan for the money, and I have experience owning top sports cars and sedans. The feel of quality Quick quiet and fun to drive. B and O sound system is the best I have heard. sporty Audi A3 A solid, sound car that is well made.  Great handling and ride.  Missing some storage in the  front driver side and I didn\\'t realize until after the purchase that I ended up with a \"stripped down\" version!  Fog lights and heated front seats are not standard equipment on the 2015 A3 quarto 4 door sedan.  But, so far (only had a month), it is a great handling, sporty, well-built car.Over a year later, and I still like the car very much.  Seems well built, solid, still handles great and gets decent mileage for a gas model.  If I were to ever buy another one, I\\'d probably go up one model so have a little more interior storage, trunk storage, plus heated front seats, fog lights, back=up camera and maybe side assist. My favorite car ever, with a few warts. I purchased this car new in October, 2014 and have 60,000 miles on the car.  I average a combined 30mpg and I am a spirited driver.  The engine in this car is phenomenal.  The acceleration is fantastic.  It\\'s a real sleeper.  I doubt there are many other cars that have four doors and excellent fuel economy that can handle and drive as well as this car.  I\\'m 6\\'2\" and the driver\\'s seat is adequate.  Be sure to purchase the upgraded seats, I did not and the passenger\\'s seat controls are very difficult to use.  The passenger seat confuses every single person who enters my car, including those who have been in my car enough to know how to operate them.  There is a knob to lean the seat back and it is not easy to use.  For an extra $500 you can get power seats all around.  There are two things with this car that annoy me to no end.  At low speeds the transmission on my car clunks in and out of gear.  It\\'s unsafe.  I\\'ve been on a slight hill and trying to get the car moving and it\\'s started rolling down the hill in the opposite direction rather than engage D or R, nearly causing an accident.  I\\'ve had it to the dealer several times and they\\'ve reset the transmission computer, but the issue was never resolved and I am now out of warranty.  The cure is to give it more gas, and this is counter intuitive and not what you want to be doing when you\\'re in a tight parking space or on a slight grade.  It truly is a safety issue and I don\\'t like it at all.  The transmission on my car also doesn\\'t shift that great.   The automatic transmission is nowhere near as good as the engine.   I\\'ve had several loaners and none have had the awful and dangerous clunking in and out of gear at low speed transmission issue my car has, and they seem to be smoother shifting as well.  My next major gripe is the sunroof.  Mine has been rattling since around 4,000 miles.  It took me a long time to determine where the rattling was coming from.  Once I found it, I took it to the dealer where they broke more parts and damaged my car.  I\\'ve taken my car to three dealers and all they\\'ve managed to do was break things and put dents, dirt and grease stains on my ceiling and lie to me and tell me don\\'t come back.  I\\'m not making this up.  I tried in vain to get support from Audi USA, but they were not helpful either.  So I have a clunky, defective transmission and rattling sunroof and no support from Audi or the dealers.  My experience with the three Audi dealerships I\\'ve visited has been horrible.  I\\'ve owned two BMWs and two Mercedes and never had issues or outright lies from dealers like I have with Audi dealerships.  Due to this, I will likely not be buying any Audis in the future.  This is a conflicting review.  I absolutely LOVE driving the A3.  The engine, handling, ability to cruise in the snow, and the car\\'s confidence in the rain combined with excellent fuel mileage offset the miserable transmission and horrible support from the dealers and Audi USA.  I really love this car, but It\\'s a mixed bag for sure.  For the $$, I wasn\\'t expecting annoying rattling and non existent dealer support starting at 4,000 miles.  It\\'s a shame the dealers have been unable and unwilling to help me resolve my transmission and sunroof issues.  I will not to go back to the Audi dealers due to the horrible treatment and outright lying I experienced.  I will deal with these annoying problems until it\\'s time for me to find a new car, which will likely not be an Audi despite my love of this car.  Audi USA, if you\\'re reading this, I tried to contact you MANY MANY times about my experiences.  It\\'s clear that you don\\'t care. Quality made in germany Nice car with excellent quality and low gas consumption. Style & Vale Great engineering, great gas mileage, great value stylish design. gremlin with horrible support ok, i leased with intent on buying.  as soon as i leased, I bought snow tires/rims, clear bra on front, and weather tech mats, audi service package, and i do extra oil changes between their service interval w audi approved oil.  Very well cared for from my end car has 20k miles.  In 20k miles I have had car shut off on highway from overheating, dealer added antifreeze, but it was above minimum and I\\'ve never had a car just shut off.  dealer said drive it in.  next I\\'ve had multiple electrical problems,  says doesn\\'t recognize key, then i walk away come back and it recognizes then problem goes away for weeks.  then brake light out signal comes up on dash, brake lights are functioning and on (took video of it) took to audi,,  says no engine code, would have to tear car down to look for a short!   so I wait to have them take care of it, and it doesn\\'t do it for months,  intermittently it will occur.  just give it a day or two and it goes away.   then i was rear ended while stopped at light (8k damages and frame/uni needed pulled to straighten)  had audi shop do the work.. got the car back and it vibrates badly from 65-80mph.  take it to body shop, they send me to Sunnyside audi service in middleburg OH, dealer service says everything is straight and balanced and no problem with their work. but they can put new tires on and balance them for 1200.00,  i reply that the car didn\\'t do this before accident, they say they don\\'t know.  I exclaim that the tires on there have plenty of wear left as i have snow tires and the tires have less than a year of road use.  they can\\'t tell me why they would shake then.  I ask for a guarantee that it would stop if replaced, can\\'t give me a guarantee.  I call audi america and they send me back to dealer.  Its a run around shell game thats completely disappointing.   I am 100% sure that the car DID NOT do this before accident and even said if you replace them and it fixes it, i will pay for them,  if it doesn\\'t then you figure out what is wrong. no luck...  so in my short experience as a first time audi owner I have only been given run around on a car with clear issues and horrible repair work (dealer even washed the car immediately after their repair shop did a paint job (you don\\'t wash and wax a car with fresh paint until it cures- at least 20-30 days, sunny side audi should know this).  anyway, each department sends me back to the next with no guarantee.  I\\'ve had a rental car for a total of 2-3 weeks in year.  Ive not had any resolution.  I will come back and post  a VIN if anyone purchases this vehicle and has problems which aren\\'t disclosed at purchase,  audi america is aware, dealership is aware and you should get an attorney.  if you get this lemon, post a reply on my post and i will get back to you with an email/give you records of incidents so you may use them for recompense.  PS i asked repair shop to make sure carfax is aware, they say they don\\'t report.  nationwide insurance company couldn\\'t give me an answer if they would report the 8k.  caveat emptor but i hope whoever buys this and has problems finds this post.  JUST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, run around.  but alot of apologies, i.e.    \"we care, we can send you back to\".  I\\'ve owned toyota, honda, ford and acura where the buck stops at dealer if any problems.   acura replaced an  600.00 engine part under extended warranty and 2 years after ( no longer in warranty) the same part had an issue,  acura fixed it free of charge under good faith that it was a bad part.  That is service.   AUDI has provided no service other than free rental cars and offer to sell me more stuff to maybe fix it. A3 is a fun car I have had my A3 for a month now and love it. Tons of power and is fun to drive, front power seats are very comfortable. the car was a new 2015 still on the lot and I got 8 grand off sticker and the dealer CPO it for 100K 6 year warranty as part of the deal as Audi had started the ticker on the base warranty 3 months ago. The trunk is a little small and I have to open the middle back seat to fit my golf clubs. I have a hard time keeping it under 80 on the high as I travel a lot, the speed alarm helps. 51000 miles with no issues I\\'ve had this car for a couple of years now and I still enjoy it every day.  I do wish a backup camera option would have been included, but I like how the car feels and drives.  So far, I have had no major issues and have just done regular maintenance.  I have found that tire rotation is necessary every 5k miles or the rear tires will wear out much faster than those on the front.  Some things that have been needed are new front brake pads and rotors, 2 sets of tires, a battery replacement (under warranty) and other recalls that were required.  Overall, I am still happy with the purchase and look forward to getting an A4 when my A3 gets old. 2015 Audi A3 It was a 2015 leftover with 40 miles when I purchased it in June of 2016. I\\'ve had the car for only 1 month but really love it. I am 50 and this is my mid-life crisis car and am really enjoying the drive. I transitioned from a soccer mom highlander driver (which is a great vehicle), to empty nester Audi A3 driver. Enjoying the ride! Love hate relationship I loved my 2015 A3 when I first bought it, but after 9,500 miles I began to have problems.  My car would turn over, but it was unable to accelerate.  The dealership had my car over two weeks and finally told me there was a defective spring on the cylinder.  Once I got the car back the EPC light started coming on and I lose power while trying to accelerate.  At other times when I accelerate the car loses power without the EPC light coming on. I took it back to the dealer and I\\'m going on day three with still no answers.  I only have 12,000 miles on this car and I shouldn\\'t be having these huge problems.  I love the look, comfort and feel of my car. When it\\'s running I love it, but I am VERY concerned that i will continue to have problems with the car.  On another note you cannot fit normal sized adults in the back seats.  Their heads don\\'t fit and there is no leg room.  The cup holders in the front are awful and it is very difficult to put large drinks in them without spilling. Lemonade season is almost over Uncomfortable rear seats with no leg room. AC is not as powerful as it should be and will not cool off your passengers in the rear seats. There has been a tapping noise coming from the sunroof which the dealership cannot seem to locate. They stated that this is normal due to the new models all glass sunroof. Experienced a loud whistling noise coming from the ac, Talk about embarrassment. The dealer said there was tree leaves. Lol. Less than a year with this car and already went in to have the ignition switch completely replaced. ( key is removed yet still recognizing a key in the ignition, if you don\\'t pay attention your interior and exterior lights will stay on and your battery will drain) The brakes have started to roll which makes me weary if I ever am in a jam. This has got to be the biggest headache known to man. At less than 11,000 miles my check oil light went on, I\\'m not sure this was a wise decision. It\\'s time to breakup! Needed more testing w/women drivers I just traded in my Audi A4 for an A3 this spring and am, in general, pretty happy with it. I bought the most tricked out model with driver assist, auto braking, etc/. No one -- I repeat -- no one does driver friendly technology the way Audi does. It\\'s one of the reasons I love the brand. Every time I drive my husband\\'s Mercedes, I cringe at having to deal with an illogical navigation system.  I love the car\\'s handling with the exception that it can be a bit trickier than my A4 on curves - perhaps because of the more narrow wheel base. The reason I say that a little more testing with women drivers would have been helpful is because the car lacks a couple of features that a woman will notice. Unlike my A4, the A3 does not have the automatic seat settings so every time I get in the car after having it valet parked, I inevitably have to move the seat back in position. But the thing that drives me absolutely nuts is that the A3 offers ONLY the options of having a driver\\'s door open with the keyless OR all 4 doors. Gentleman - what exactly do you think a lady does with her larger size handbag? Hint: we do not hike it over the console!!!! We put it in the back seat, which means that you should have offered the setting to open only the two doors on the driver\\'s side or allow the doors to open independently. Now, I have no choice but to use the 4-door setting, which makes me more vulnerable to things like carjacking when I get in my car in a parking garage. A great smaller Audi I traded a 2013 A4 for an A3 2.0 Premium Plus Quattro. It\\'s about a foot shorter than the A4 and feels sportier and quicker since it has the same engine but is smaller and lighter. The interior is definitely up to Audi standards, but the CD player is placed in the glove box, making it useless when the driver is alone (unless you want to drive into a ditch changing a CD!). The handling is sporty, steering seems tighter than the A4, and the car rides just as well as its larger cousin. The engine is quiet and smooth but there seems to be more road noise than the A4, probably due to less sound insulation. Mileage has been impressive, quite a bit better than the A4.  Comfort and space int the front seat seem equal to the A4 but the back is understandably tighter. The bucket seats are firm and comfortable on a long trip. Drove through several snowstorms this winter, and the Quattro all-wheel drive keeps the car feeling secure and planted. Overall, I love this car--it has Audi\\'s classy styling and quality in a smaller package that\\'s fun to drive. You get a leaky roof with an Audi Convertible??? My A3 has been in the shop a total of 3 visits / 30 days.  One visit was never recorded with Audi after 7 days of trying to trouble shoot and duplicate the leaking, which they never did get to leak....supposedly.  Took it in twice to a dealer with it physically  and they still said I was imagining things.  REALLY DISAPPOINTING AND VERY FRUSTRATING after I had such high expectations of buying a luxury European car such as Audi AND FOR THE PRICE.  The convertible button is located on the lower console but my puppy (45 pounds) steps on it, it starts rolling up.  One other time he stepped on the power button and the doors locked with my key fob sitting on my seat, he stepped on the lock button on the key fob....glad the windows were down partially and I could reach my key.  Lesson learned there and really pretty stupid of me to leave my puppy in the car to talk to the mailman, but thought they might make it a bit harder than that to lock yourself out.  Surprised the key fob isn\\'t deactivated if detected in the car. Pinch protection on the windows was not working, one day I went to my car after it poured rain for 3 hours and drivers window was down 1/3 of the way and the interior door, seat and floor were soaked. This happened with the passenger rear window as well.  The Audi connect never stayed connected, had to go through a big process every time I tried to use it and log in again and again, with a pin and other annoying login criteria, it was only a 3 month trial.  After that you pay $500/year for the service and as far as I could tell, you only received a satellite image of the navigation, which for that price I am ok with 3D. Navigation seems really outdated even with the most current version....supposedly.  The one thing good about my car is the ride.  I do enjoy the handling and peppy pick up, VERY SLOW acceleration which they say because it has a clutch system, which I thought would be instant. Probably should have saved myself $20k and bought a Beetle convertible - same options and details since they are made by the same company. The convertible is lumpy and creases easily.  Large amount of road noise which I believe is associated with the top leaking since it is not sealing properly.  The Quattro is very nice in the winter. Glitchy annoyances like after closing convertible it turns my heater on full blast and it\\'s 90 degrees out. If you switch from radio screen to navigation it goes to radio stations in the area not the presets that it was on so you have to switch back and hit the preset button again.  I could go on and on......I would pass if I were you!! Great car, not perfect. Pros: Low MSRP for a luxury car. Interior was extremely well built. Very quiet ride, very comfortable. Driving was great besides acceleration. Good fuel economy if you don\\'t drive it very hard.Cons: Tight headroom for the backseat. Subpar cargo capacity, less than a BMW 3 series. Slow acceleration.I think this car is amazing! If you don\\'t mind the cargo being slightly smaller than average, I\\'d say this is the best compact car EVER! Besides, the cargo space is enough unless your carrying something huge, in which case you don\\'t want ANY compact sedan. Be aware that this is my opinion on this car, your experience will most likely be different. Horrible experience with Audi A3 Cabriolet I leased a new 2015 Audi A3 Cabriolet from Audi Palo Alto in October. A few weeks back as the car was climbing a hill enroute to Lombard street in San Francisco in Traffic, it started slipping backwards and refused to accelerate upwards. The cars behind me naturally honked and drivers were mad at my car not only blocking traffic but slipping backwards. When I switched off the car and tried restarting it would not start for 10 min. After 10 min, it started again and went up 100 feet and again slipped backwards. Somehow after an hour long traumatic experience, I got out of the hill. Following this, I had a horrible experience with the service team at Audi Palo Alto too... First Teutonic love affair This is my first Audi and I have to say I\\'m in love. The little 1.8 pulls hard at the lower end and the grip is seemingly endless. I constantly catch myself pushing its limits in the corners and even when the limit is hit the electric steering does a good job of letting me know. When not bombing corners, the car is incredibly composed and serene, especially at highway speeds. I\\'ve never been happier and I\\'m actually let down when I hop in any other vehicle. The audi service department is also excellent. Whenever I go in for an oil change or otherwise they seem to throw me the keys to a rental and get everything taken care of quickly. All round excellence! I have driven my 2015 Audi A3 for 1 week as of today. I have a Premium and only upgrade is to cold weather package. This car delivers an excellent value for the purchase price and is surprisingly well equipped for a base, entry level model. It has standard sun-roof, leather seats, an incredibly easy to use MMI system and with my upgrade heated seats. Working with my Audi sales rep was a very pleasant and experience and my purchase was made both easy and fun. Trading from a Jeep Commander, I was concerned about how I would feel driving a small sedan again, but the A3 feels confident and controlled. Couldn\\'t be happier! Buy something else Nice little car with decent performance, however, the transmission required replacement after 9300 miles and 8 months of ownership. Manufacturing defect or not, this is an unacceptably low level of quality. I traded the car in on a different brand of vehicle immediately after the transmission was replaced. At least the repair was covered under warranty. Also, the mixed city/highway gas mileage is overrated. I consistently got near the bottom of the range, without hammering on the accelerator all the time. I got good mileage on long trips, though. Truth in Egineering? Unbelievable but the transmission had to be replaced. Car was not even driven off the dealer for a week.  I had picked up the car on Sunday, driven it to work for a week and tooling around on Saturday when I notice the engine light came on followed shortly by a yellow warning message that the car\\'s reverse gear may not be working but the car was considered drivable?  Say what?I realized the car would not move past 3rd gear and started a high pitch whine in the transmission.  Short story, the car was placed on a flatbed tow truck (Quattro) and take back to the dealer.  Monday afternoon I was told car needed new transmission and that it had to be shipped in.  Battery has been replaced twice. My favorite Audi yet I am a fan of Audis because of their design (elegant and innovative), quality (fit and finish) and general reliability (I have not experienced some of the problems with Audis that other owners have). The 2015 A3 is my eighth Audi and fast becoming my favorite. While I had to get the prestige and sport packages to have the car equipped the way I wanted it ($$$) it is well worth it.  I love the styling, minimalist interior (think uncluttered but functional), intuitive MMI with handwriting recognition, and power (think fun to drive, agile and fast).  A mix of Good and bad Great looking, great handling, fast. Incredible build quality too. I got it with the 18\" wheels, cold weather package and color navigation with MMI.I bought my 2015 USED with 6k miles on it,just sold it after 18 months of use and 27k.The bad:Off the line lack of power,probably the turbo lag and the CVT to blame ( always used sport mode to help since i live in the city).Seats are not comfortable,unbearable after more than an hour.Handling decent,but hits its limits fast and then you suddenly get the felling the back end will spin out (even if it doesn\\'t).Gas tank too small,needs another 2 or 3 gallons.No regular USB unless you buy there expensive adapter.Not much luxury at all for an Audi.DEPRECIATION WAS HORRIBLE,stickered for almost 38k,trade in at the best of 6 dealerships was 21.5K with 27,000 miles.The good:Beastly acceleration after the second or 2 of lag.Handling around turns within it\\'s limits is a blast.Basic stereo sounds great.Build quality is superb,especially on the interior.The Scuba Blue paint really turned heads. 2015 Audi A3 1.8 Premium w/ Driver Assist Package I just starting leasing the A3 in white with chocolate leather for much less per month than I was paying for my Volvo S60. The back up camera and driver assist (blind spot system) work well and are nice features. The MMI system is excellent and easy to use. The displays and controls are built well. The panoramic sunroof, xenon headlights, LED lights, rain sensor wipers and overall styling made me choose this car over BMW 2 series, Volvo S60 and Mercedes CLA 250. You get so many features in the base model compared to competitors. I would have liked stiffer steering and more power in the 1.8 engine especially in sport mode, but overall I\\'m very pleased.  Holy Cow what a POS Had the car for four months, dealership had it for half that time. Power window issues that couldn\\'t be fixed (charged me each time as if warranty didn\\'t exist). Shaking at certain speeds (40mph and then again at 60mph), dealership told me I had to buy four new wheels...and that didn\\'t fix it. Nav didn\\'t work for days on end for some reason and then randomly started working again. One of the worst cars I\\'ve ever owned. Don\\'t be fooled with how great this car looks because it is an overpriced piece of junk. I ended up trading it in to be rid of it because it was leeching my time, money, and sanity. Transmission Issues I loved the car until it almost got me in an accident. Yes the car is very nice and fun to drive but be careful. I am currently extremely disappointed with purchase. \\r The transmission on my weeks old 2015 A3 completely failed. Almost made me get in an accident because it stopped so suddenly. I was one block away from entering the freeway before it failed\\r To make it worse, my just returned \"fixed\" A3 with a brand new transmission now makes a loud ticking noise &amp;amp; sounds like it\\'s years old.  Great Mix of Sport and Luxury. This car is great and well rounded. If you are looking for a all wheel drive vehicle with a luxury name that is also fast look no further! The 2.0 Quattro is the way to go. BMW has a sweet 2 series but its coupe only and no AWD. The mercedes CLA is nice but does not match the performance of the A3. I also liked that Audi installed a S tronic sport tranmission in this car not just a normal CVT Trans that is in the A4. Very unreliable. I owned a brand new 2015 Audi A3 for about 6 months and it was plagued with problems. Windows that wouldn\\'t go back up, burning oil, a transmission that stopped shifting, nav and tech issues. While not ideal, all of this would have been ok if Audi actually fixed these problems and/or didn\\'t attempt to charge me to fix these problems when I brought the car in for service. That is the ultimate problem with this car and the brand. They don\\'t support you after the purchase of the vehicle. I\\'ve heard excuse upon excuse on why they are not responsible for anything that goes wrong with the car. I traded it for a BMW 3-Series and what a difference in the service you receive. I will never buy an Audi again. Love it! I\\'m a few weeks into my new 2015 Audi A3 after having had several VW\\'s (Eos, Rabbit, and a Jetta). I love it!! I got white with black interior, premium plus, sports package, and bang & olufsen speakers. I didn\\'t get the MMI navigation simply because I won\\'t use it -- so why pay for it.I think the most surprising thing for me is just how fun the car is to drive. It\\'s zippy; especially in sport mode. It\\'s definitely not \"just another Jetta.\" The engine/transmission is completely different than VW\\'s, and it really has a lot more power. Plus, with quattro, it\\'s all wheel drive.It\\'s definitely worth the money. It\\'s very nice; all the bells and whistles you want and need. I said \"Bye, Felicia!\" to a BMW 328 for this car I purchased this car as a CPO with 13,000 miles (it was a dealer loaner) after getting rid of a very problematic BMW that was in the shop every month for the 9 months that I had it (always a new issue). I was leery about getting another VW product after being burned with issues galore by two late 90\\'s-era Jettas and my 2004 Passat, but that was a long time ago and I had recently read that Audi reliability was #3 or #4 out of all brands, so I took a leap o\\' faith. It\\'s been a month, and so far, I have been VERY impressed. I actually have the 1.8T with the Premium Plus package, and it has everything I could ever want-heated seats, Nav (which comes with a free 6 month subscription to AT&T that turns the car into a rolling hotspot and links the Nav up to Google Earth-which is pure awesomeness), Dual Climate AC, and the best part of all-the Bang & Olufsen stereo-which truly is \"banging\\'\". I had the Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade in my 328, and I didn\\'t think it was possible-but the B & O system is way better! Thus far everything is working as it should-no interior lights have burned out nor interior trim pieces have broken off, a la my previous VW\\'s.I recently broke the car in on a Cannonball run to West Texas-6 hours in the car and the seats still felt comfortable. The car is rock-steady at 90-100 MPH, and passing power is more than ample.  My only complaints are sometimes there is excessive road noise (dependent on the road surface, of course)-but I believe this is due to the lower-profile optional 18-inch 10 spokes that I have on my car. Also, due to these tires, you can feel more imperfections in the road, and I don\\'t like the way the brakes feel when braking with these tires, either.The car is small, but it\\'s designed to be a small car so I\\'m really surprised when people say the trunk space and backseat are inadequate. Duh. I have no kids so it\\'s a perfect size-my BMW was actually too big for my preferences. The gas tank is relatively small, so I find myself filling up more only due to its size (I think 12 or 13 gallons max) and not due to bad fuel economy-in the traffic hell that is Austin I still average 28 MPG. This car is right-sized with very sophisticated styling that pictures don\\'t do justice. I think these cars are a fantastic value if you get a slightly used one, mine brand new cost $37K with all the options I have. surprisingly missing some standard stuff Let me say right off that I love the car.  Having owned 4 diesel VW Jetta\\'s previously, it was time to move up.A few small quibbles though:   No heated seats???  Are you kidding?  My last Jetta cost 14 grand less and had heated seats.And the big gripe:   You cannot move the or extend the sun visors.  In other words, if the sun is coming at you from the side and you position the the visor to your left while driving, there is a huge 7 inch gap,  which cannot be blocked because the visor will not slide in or out.   Again, even the cheaper Jetta could do that.Very annoying.Oh, and the GPS system is fairly useless, and will be expensive to update, and event which can only occur once per year???!!!  Stick with Google maps.Other than that, the car is extremely solid, and very confidence inspiring while driving. Audi vs BMW UPDATED REVIEW:I don\\'t need to write about dieselgate which applies to my car because we all now what a disaster this is for TDI owners and the environment! Functionality: the NAVIGATION is THE PITS. First of all it doesn\\'t recognize many street addresses, businesses and locations. It doesn\\'t take into account traffic- I live in LA so it\\'s useless and it gives you random hazard alerts that are hundreds of miles away- there is no way to program this. In short, the navigation is 100% USELESS and I am forced to use Wayz every time I get  in my car. BLUETOOTH: NOBODY CAN HEAR WHEN I TALK ON THE PHONE USING MY BLUETOOTH.  I have to move my head close to the speaker and shout into it. Other issues: the car doesn\\'t come or even make an emergency spare key (usually plastic) so if you surf, don\\'t want the valet to have access to everything in your trunk, or are sporty it\\'s a huge inconvenience- the only option is carrying a very bulky metal key.Positives: the trunk has hooks which are great for grocery bags. The car looks great and sporty but I certainly don\\'t get the mileage advertised. Truth in Mpg 44.2 Update: VW Diesel Scandel has changed my opinion 180 Degrees. Can\\'t wait to trade away from this car. Don\\'t want to be associated with VW Audi. Who knows what other representations are false? Safety ? Reliability? Horrible Service Bought a 2015 Audi A3 a little over a month ago. Great car, but having problems with the navigation MMI already. Tells me that the car is somewhere I am not, and doesn\\'t catch the speed traps which all other Audi\\'s do here in Korea. Took it to AUDI KOREA service center twice and they can\\'t figure it out. Basically told me I am out of luck. This is of course AFTER taking my car our for a 44 km joy ride and unplugging the black box so there would be no evidence (expect for my empty gas tank). I just hope Audi Headquarters finds a solution to fix the MMI because the AUDI KOREA dealership and service center are incompetent and horrible. Please hire employees that know how to fix their own produc 1st time Audi Owner/Love the TDI My last 2 vehicles have been BMWs. I was open to other German automakers and very interested in a diesel vehicle because of the fuel economy. I was also looking at the \\'15 328d, but ended up with the A3 as it was more affordable (also smaller). My last vehicle was a V8 550i with very poor gas mileage. Now with my new A3 TDI I am getting 45-48 mpg on my commute to work. The interior is very simple but elegant and uses high quality materials. I got the sport package and the sport seats are very comfortable. I am very happy with my purchase because I accompanied my goal of finding a vehicle that is very practical, fuel efficient, a luxury brand, and not too expensive. I  highly recommend the A3 Pleasantly surprised. All my trepidation of owning a diesel in a cold climate have melted away.Cold weather operations a breeze due to heated seats ( not like the seat warmers in my Q5) that even my wife had to turn down. Audi has an aux heater that starts blowing hot air in about 2-3 mins when it\\'s -20.I commute everyday and fill my tank about once a month. The fuel economy is attractive paying for itself each time I fill-up. 2010 audi a3 2.0t quattro titanium pkg. Had the car almost 2 months now and cant stop driving it. I make excuses to take it out for spins all the time. The car is pretty rare i have only seen one in my town which makes it pretty exclusive. i have had people follow me just to ask me questions about it. It is definitely one of those cars which look better in person. Pictures do not do it justice. The interior is very classy and understated. the exterior has good lines and looks like it will age well. The performance is excellent though it is hard to compare it with anything, its sort of in a class of its own. The grip is amazing i was surprised on how nimble it was, especially having quattro and using launch control from a stop. bittersweet: sweet to drive, bitter to maintain I bought this car used, from a low volume dealer (shady, I know) with 54k on the odometer. It was a terrible purchase, even at a price I thought was great. It was leaking coolant the third day home, and required over $5k in repairs the first year. It was out of warranty, buyer beware, etc. I still like the car. It is expensive to fix, but when it is good, it is really good. Nothing cruises at highway speeds like a German car. Plenty of power, even on a high mileage engine. One thing I learned during the first year of ownership is this: don\\'t take it to a dealership for service, period. You will overpay, in a ridiculous way. Example: bent rim, new wheel: $825. Really. I bought four new wheels and tires on tirerack.com for a hundred more than that, and they were lighter rims, and look better. That is just one example. The best thing you can do is learn to do your own maintenance/repairs and be vigilant. Read the online forums and watch the youtube tutorials. You will have to buy all new tools with a german car though. It is nothing like an American or Japanese car, which I have previously owned. Lots of starbolt fasteners. Even the wheels are held on by lugbolts (17mm) instead of lugnuts, which freaked me out the first time I rotated the tires. Most used car ownership experiences have a few repairs involved, especially once you break six figures on the odometer. For an Audi/Volkswagen, the parts are expensive and the service at the dealership is outrageous. I suppose I knew that going in, but that first year was rough.The interior is holding up pretty well and it looks like a much newer car than it is. The front seats are supportive and comfortable even on long road trips. The leather has held up well with a minimum amount of creasing and no cracks. The seatback on the passenger side did randomly detach at one point, but I was able to fix it with a pair of pliers and some glue. The navigation system is one of the least user friendly I have ever used, with a very cumbersome amount of effort to program a destination. It works fine once you get it programmed I guess, but I just navigate on my phone to avoid the headache. The bluetooth is easy to program at least, but it doesn\\'t stream audio to the radio. The system does have an input for an aux cord though, and my wife likes the satellite radio. The sound is great.The performance is the best part about the car. It is a GTI in a fancy suit. Plenty of power to keep the driver entertained and with the S-line sport package you get great steering feel and confidence during cornering. Under aggressive acceleration I get a lot of wheel slip, which is the only gripe I have. Even with grippy summer tires, you have to baby the throttle a little bit. Most drivers probably aren\\'t as lead footed as I am though, so it may not be an issue for most. The transmission is as high end as I have ever driven (manual), with smooth clutch engagement and a shifter that slides into gear like a hot knife through butter - so smooth. It feels very refined, but is every bit the sport hatchback when you want to play.The exterior of the car has also held up very well. The paint is still glossy like new. The styling on this car was well ahead of its time, and it doesn\\'t look even a little dated. My wife fell in love with it because of the looks, and she hates hatchbacks. I get compliments on it all the time.You take the good with the bad. The Audi has been a bittersweet ownership experience. Sweet to drive but bitter to keep it running. One of the vehicles I\\'ve owned that I will miss. Solid car. Tracks great. At 72 on cruise control gets 30 mpg. Averages between 27 and 28 mpg combined.Have been very happy with it but looking for something a little bigger, but still in a sport back, or hatchback. Same thing, different terminology. A lot to like I love the car. It does very well at providing both exceptional fuel economy, and the visceral experience of driving a performance car. While not a rocket, the car is fit for the fast lane and is really fun to drive.  A3 TDI This is a great little car. Have had it for 7 months and am very pleased with it. I bought it primarily for it\\'s fuel efficiency and not disappointed, averaging 45 mpg hwy & 37 city. Car is comfortable, quiet and has fairly good handling. The A3 has a clean exterior (sport wagon look) and a well laid out interior. Audi builds a quality car and while the A3 is their entry level vehicle, my opinion is that they did a fine job with the A3. It is pricier than the VW Jetta TDI but the detail level between the cars warrants the higher price. Acceleration issue? Less than 2,000 miles on the car and I\\'ve noticed a sudden loss in power twice now when accelerating from a stop. Once from a traffic light was simply annoying and the 2nd time pulling out of a parking spot into traffic was dangerous. Anyone else notice this?  The normal performance is great.  The car is at the dealer for repair now. Still the best. I have the car now for 5 months and still find it amazing.  It has performed flawlessly without any glitches and the mileage has been great. The interior is so versatile and handles all my needs.  I feel very safe and secure when driving and would make the same purchase again. I highly recommend the TDI to all. Still in love At 4,000, am thoroughly in love:  Blast to drive, lots of torque, great mountain road control with paddle gear selectors. Plus, averaging 40.8 mpg combined (no commute traffic, lots of freeway).  Corners tight and flat, excellent control.  A3 TDI perfection! Had been interested in purchasing a diesel for some time now but never seemed to make financial sense until the A3 TDI came out.  Only $1200 more than a standard FWD A3.  The Fed tax credit of $1300 covered the difference plus the state waives sales tax.   What a great car!  Love how it drives and rides. The TDI engine has plenty of pull to get on the highway and for passing.  The interior is very impressive with surprisingly amount of room. The exterior looks fantastic especially with the LED/xenon headlights and black sunroof.  Extremely happy with the purchase. Averaging 39 mpg.   Great job Audi!  First Update Passed 1000 miles with flying colors.  Able to push it a bit and diesel torque is evident.  Combined mileage at about 35 mpg, highway over 45.  If the reliability holds up -- so far, so good -- will likely sell my second car (\\'98 BMW540).  Couldn\\'t be happier but am looking forward to an A4 wagon with diesel.  More wheelbase, more power. Caution: This is a small car, not for large people.  At 5\\'7\" and 130 lbs, it\\'s just right for me.   Little Green Machine Traded in a 2008 Prius that had a lot of technology but no comfort. The A3 is amazing and so beyond all I could ask for.  It is very upscale inside and out.  The mpg is excellent and the torque is a thrill.  The Ipod interface allows me to have a lot of CD\\'s in an organized fashion, and the Bose sound is so clear and deep.  The Navigation has real time traffic and a crisp and clear screen.  I love the LED lights front and back.  The car in Ibis white looks very European, especially with the black open sky roof.  The transmission feels like a manual without all the work.  Storage room is a little better than the Prius.  I highly recommend the A3 TDI for MPG as well as practicality. Two weeks old Just had my A3 TDI for two weeks but, so far, it\\'s an outstanding little vehicle.  Peppy, quick steering, and great to shift in the manual mode.  Build quality and economy are excellent, ride is a tad choppy but sure-footed, comfort is adequate, and interior and exterior are show- stoppers.  My other car is a 540 BMW, so the downsize is taking a bit of adjustment -- don\\'t know how I\\'ll like the A3 on a long trip -- but so far, a big thumbs up.  Anxious to take out to the interstate for a 500 mile shakedown. Audi TDI  Bought our car Dec 23rd - drove 500 miles home - we are averaging 35 mpg in the break in period. Enjoying the comfort and fun of driving but find the navigation system very deficient compared to our Lexis RX400h system. Wish AUDI offered homelink in this car - the convenience group would be even more convenient with the ability to open at least a garage and neighborhood gate.   Irritating rattles in the sunroof are waiting adjustment. Wish AUDI included at least one quart of oil for the break in period.   Overall very pleased with this car - would highly recommend. great little car to drive around in the only problem i have with the car is the getting in and getting in out of driver seat and the basic entertainment radio Amazing car! Wow. This car never fails to put a smile on my face, I have owned this car for 2 years and I\\'ve never had a problem with it other than regular maintenance, almost right away I replaced the stock tires for more stick tires, and wow does this car like to corner! It\\'s straight line speed it kind of lack luster but then again it was not really made for that. It loves to accelerate out of corners and while doing so it still feels like you are riding in luxury! On the highway I get great MPG, not so much in the city though. Getting in and out of the car is a little bit of a hassle but is immediately worth it once you sit down. Ten Year Review What a fun car from a  Corvette owner also.  Built her on-line in 2006, found her with everything except the gray interior (has Camel). At 65,000 miles Mary Jane has to have her front Boots repaired.  Not bad for ten years. Great road car in snow and rain.  Has open sky, very fun option.  Has Bluetooth, CD, and Cassette player.  Perhaps will not sell for these options alone.  Has the active headlight option where the lights are just ahead of your turns. It is also the S-Line quattro with 18 inch fancy wheels. Has things and functions if not used on a regular basis, one has to get out the book to remember what does what. Everything still works fine. Perhaps one of the most fun things is being able to put the rear seats down for hauling a family of dogs or whatever.  Excellent road car, but not the best mileage. can achieve 30 mpg if one does not go over about 68 MPH.  They only put six forward gears in this racing transmission.  They now have seven to eight gears in the new Audi models.  At highway speeds the motor should not be turning more than about 2000 RPM\\'s.  Would prefer about 1750 @ 70-75 MPH.  It is turning over 3000 RPM......a killer for mileage.................Very cool, good looking, functional car anyway.  Much better looking than the sedans for me. Better than 2015 Golf TSI, Worse than 1997 Golf Bought a used one that had 100 K.\\rOwned for 3 days and I am impressed. \\rFirst I regretted of having bought such a small car (low ceiling) but, the rear seats are actually roomier than many other compact cars. Price was about half of the cheaper new compact cars, so I am saving quite a lot. Perhaps I will end up using up all these savings repairing this car. But, the car is so lovely that I don\\'t mind doing that.  Not impressed I bought the 2007 Audi A3 used. It was a 1 owner car with 68k miles on it. The car was clean and beautiful! I drove it for 4 months before I traded it in and lost 5k on the trade in deal alone. The AC system failed, and it caused the motor to over heat. Saved the motor, but I had to replace the entire AC system. Cost me $1700 bucks! The rear power window broke. Window went down and never came back up. Cost me $450.The glass top sun roofs are a great idea until you see how HOT the inside of the car gets from the sun beaming down on it. I live in the south and that little car was never \"cool\" inside. The cup holders are a joke, you cant fit more than 1 drink period!  Audi A3 dissapointed Although my Audi A3 is fun to drive and handles well, I am extremely disappointed by the frequency and cost of repairs, and cost of maintenance.My 2007 A3 has only 79k miles but I have spent about $4,000 in repairs in maintence in the past two years.That is inexcusable and not something I expected from a supposedly high end auto manufacturer.Actively looking for a new car. German Engineering?..i get it now. As a 40 year old driver, i have had alot of vehicles, mostly American, some Asian. I purchased a 1 owner 80,000 mile 2007 A3 2.0T. It is the best car i have ever owned. for those of you driving arround in American or Japanese cars...you are really missing out on \"real driving\" this entry level Audi runs circles around the big 3\\'s flagship cars. Fun to drive, reliable, quick, and Quality, Quality, Quality. I will now only consider European cars. And Audi is the best bang for your buck in quality, luxury, style and covers every need. At 80,000now 95,000 miles it is mistaken for brand new by people on the street. No problums doing 50-70 miles 7 days a week. I LOVE THIS CAR!! 200 hp with 4-cylinder (turbo)! Ibis White, S-Line Black Leather Interior with 6- speed Manual Transmission.  Amazing looking car - inside and out - received many compliments - even from people in other cars and pedestrians!  Fun to drive, although steering will be nicer if  stiffer at higher speeds.   Great handling - have driven very well defensively in the crazy traffic in LA.  Navigation with the knob takes too long and needs time to learn - although the DVD update makes it very accurate and quick.  Good power for a 4 cylinder engine!  Luxury car - can be expensive to maintain and repair if out of warranty My three years with an A3 This is a great driving car. I don\\'t particularly care for FWD, but it does handle great! Fun to drive, great MPG, 26-27 in normal, mixed driving and recently 32 mpg at 75 mph on a road trip. The DSG has been as enjoyable as I thought it would. I cannot compliment the \"interior experience\" of this car enough..great driving position, comfortable, relatively quiet (now that I\\'ve replaced the original P6 tires), excellent drivability and great brakes. 4 banger is quiet and smooth. The Full Package! The A3 is a very stylish, powerful, and gas efficient \"mini\" wagon.  With a chip and performance downpipe, I was able to make 230hp and 263tq at the wheels.  I have the S-Line w/ Technology package 2.0T FSI and some of the major known problems are as follows: 1. Divertor valve tearing (easy to remedy w/ new piston-type revision valve) 2. Burning oil (varies from car to car but personally I only add 1qt per 5000 mi) 3. Clogging intake valves due to the nature of direct injection (fixed by running a catch can set-up) 4. Cam follower wear on high pressure fuel pump (this is a wear item that should be changed out every 30k and check every oil change, only $50 part but VW/Audi won\\'t tell you that). Livesaver! We got the A3 because it was fun to drive and was a luxury wagon.   Last week my husband was stopped in traffic on the highway and was rear ended by a Dodge Caravan going 50-60 MPH.   The A3 is a total loss with over 19,000 in visual damage alone.   The safety features in this car can\\'t be beat, while my husband has some injuries he was able to walk away from a serious multi-vehicle accident. Certified Used I bought this A3 with 7000 miles and it displayed very little wear. After driving it for a month in icy and snowy conditions I am very impressed. The stock all season tires get the job done but the fronts are worn a good bit. There are no rattles and the s-tronic transmission works very well. Handling is excellent and the mileage is decent considering the power and weight, about 20mpg in mixed winter driving. The A3 tends to be very touchy when accelerating from a stop, it\\'s jerky and hard to achieve a smooth getaway. The brakes are excellent. Overall, I\\'m very pleased with the interior quality and look of the A3. I drove the 2.0 turbo and I feel the V6 is considerably better. Design ERROR Have an A4, love it, decided to get an A3.  Worse mileage than our truck, turns 3000 RPMs at highway speed, can\\'t even make 10MPH in 1st gear.  TERRIBLE design point. We\\'ve contacted Audi, they blame everyone else (dealer, etc) -  but it is the worst design I have seen in 30 years of buying cars.  Lighter than the A4, same power (V6), smaller, and about 10MPG worse than the A4 - blows my mind.  We won\\'t touch Audi again - due to Audi USA refusing to discuss, acknowledge, suggest fixes (ie, different gear ratio in the differentials).  By the way, I\\'m an engineer, have extensive auto experience... Not a good purchase!! I purchased the premium package with the white exterior and dark grey interior.  This is a good looking car, BUT I have had so many problems with it.  Exteriorly, the trim on the sky system keeps on popping off.  I had to bring my vehicle in 4 times to get this fixed.  The Pirelli tires that come stock are terrible! I had to replace the fronts under 20000 and the rear 25000.  Now I am having engine problems with the transmission.  Recommendation: don\\'t purchase this vehicle! Also very noisy while driving past 60 mph especially if you get the roof racks, which are also junk.  Mine broke the first week I got them.  Bigger than it appears. And it Rocks! The car seems pricey for an A3 sized chassis, but the car seats everyone comfortably. The hatchback also can fit a lot. I bought a big grill at Home Depot and the sales associate looked at me like I was crazy for thinking the grill in its box would fit in my car. It did. Hatchback closed. The car accelerates and handles great. I do seem to go through tires a bit, and I\\'ve been told that by mechanics that the A3 does seem to chew up the front three tires faster than normal. Fun! It has been very reliable. There are none of the squeaks or rattles identified in other reviews. It brakes confidently. Steering is wonderful and acceleration makes it plenty quick without being stupid fast. What the reviews don\\'t tell you is that this is the ultimate city car. Compact, practical, quick and stylish. Yet it will pour itself done a twisty back road with verve. It\\'s only weakness is touring on US freeways. For that you need something heavier with a longer wheel base. But since 90% of my driving is in the city, I couldn\\'t be happier with my choice.  Beware of the clutch take up on the DSG transmission. It is set agressively.  Surpurised by lack of quality This is a great, versatile car. It offers  a fun to drive, economical vehicle that can also hull a large amount of equipment, especially with the rear seats folded down. I don\\'t think any other car on the market has all of this. I purchased the S-line with just about every option available. I can\\'t imagine living without rain sensing wipers now. Which leads to my dilemma.  I will have to replace this car before the warranty runs out.  I have had three major issues with the vehicle with a total down time of well over a month, and this within the first year of ownership. I hate to say it, but I cannot recommend this car based on its poor reliability. Love this car! I love this car.  I have approximately 6000 miles on it.  I like the feel of the car - very nicely done - and the pick up, but the engine noise is a bit loud.  The manual says to shift earlier - right.  I am a bit disappointed about having to choose between the Ipod plug or Sirius.  For this kind of money you would think they could figure out how to include both options together.  I really love the sun roof and moon roof.  The drive is smooth and the seats are comfortable.  I drove everything from the Fit to the A3 and by far this was the best car if you are looking for a hatchback.  The only problem I have had was a bad sensor in the fuel tank set off the engine light, but it was fixed. So far, my A3 is a blast and a half! I bought my A3 because I wanted a vehicle with smaller dimensions than my \\'98 Passat, but I wanted many of the qualities I enjoyed in the VW that I didn\\'t find in Japanese or American vehicles. The dimensions for parking in crowded Seattle is a blessing. The acceleration performance is wonderful, and handling is very good but not great. The practicality is what I wanted. I finally was convinced that it made sense to now own an auto trans mainly because of the excellent 6-spd. twin clutch auto. I realize I could have purchased a VW Rabbit/Golf GTI with many of the same qualities and features for far less, but I wanted the more premium features of the Audi, and I prefer its exterior design. Audi A3 is Good The A3 is delightfully deceptive, looking small on the outside but airy and roomy inside and appearing underpowered by a 2 liter engine but providing more get up and go than many larger engines.  In addition, it\\'s beautifully assembled and it handles like a true sport.  Fuel efficiency is good, averaging 29 mpg. The iPod interface works well, the sound system is super, the steering responsive and sure, and the wipers clear without clatter or skipping.   Superb I have had my A3 for over a month and absolutley love it.  The only option I wanted and got is the Open Sky System, which has worked pretty much flawlessly.  I\\'ve been averaging between 29 and 30 miles per gallon (highest slightly over 32, lowest slightly over 26).  Runs fine on 89 octane and hasn\\'t required the addition of any oil.  Cargo room seems endless (I can fit two large laundry baskets behind the rear seats without having to fold them down).  I have noticed an occasional light rattle in the driver\\'s side A-pillar, and, when approaching speeds of 80 mph, a humming noise from the passenger side of the front sunroof.  Also, parking brake is obstructed when front armrest is down.     Practical yet satisfying Finally got rid of my SUV for this joy.  Drove it on 1200-mile (both ways) trips and seats were comfortable enough not to have to stop every 2 hours, fuel economy was impressive, and you feel like you are glued to the road at highway speeds.  Trunk space leaves a little to be desired since you can\\'t even fit golf clubs back there without folding the seats down.  Great car though. Wish you could get the options offered on the web at the dealerships without having to buy the entire packages. Great overall balance Coming off a zippy Mazda RX-8 sportscar, I really was dreading switching to the A3.  I thought that a \"wagon\" really could not be that fun to drive, or perform well.  I was wrong.  The 2.0T with the DSG transmission and the S-line package is a blast to drive.  The steering is a bit light for my tastes (the RX-8\\'s was perfect, so maybe I am just spoiled), but handling, acceleration, power and shifting are all top notch.  The Open Sky package was not one I wanted, but I now find it a great way to make the driving experience more enjoyable.  The only gripes I have are the control system is a bit too complex and maybe the seats could be a hair more comfortable.  Fuel economy is great though. Get radar detector Car has open sky, premium, illumination and cold weather package.  A blast to drive.  Great engine/transmission.  Great acceleration.  Ride is solid and tight. Steering feels great. Interior design is excellent.  Sound system is great.  Like a video game on the highway; quick downshift (not that you have to) and 80 becomes 100 in a blink.     Upgrade from unreliable VW Jetta 1.8T I upgraded from a very unreliable, but fun to drive, manual, VW Jetta 1.8T.  I was nervous about staying in the VW brand but the second I drove the A3, I knew I had to buy it.  I thought I\\'d miss the manual tranny by getting the DSG, but it\\'s more manual transmission than automatic and I don\\'t miss the stick at all.  The interior quality is outstanding, the seats are not as comfortable as the A4, but still fine for daily driving.  The Open Sky system is a splurge, probably not worth the 1100 MSRP sticker price, but I couldn\\'t imaging the car without it.  Golf Clubs don\\'t fit in the back without the seats being folded down, but there is a ton of rear passenger leg room.   Wildly fun to drive It\\'s light, powerful, precise, well-balanced and stops well.  Great mileage in Drive mode, wildly fun on mountain roads in Sport mode.  Bluetooth and see-around-corners lights and seat heater work well. Very comfortable for driver.  Premium comes with good electric seat - for the driver only. Passenger seat manually adjust with big wheel to tilt seat, like our 87 VW Cabriolet - this is a horrible method. Air conditioner works fine on first trip.  If restarted when warm, air wants to freeze you, so it ceases to be automatic. Bose stereo is great, but CD changer is very hard to reach and ther is no iPod input!  And no workaround except FM transmitter, which is not good in saturated FM market. Getaway car Purchased my A3 2.0T after much research and driving the competition. I kept coming back to the A3, and so glad I did. This little vixen grows on you. The DSG, coupled with a very flat torque curve, makes acceleration so effortless that I find myself glued to the rear view mirror. I don\\'t think \"Audi made me do it\" would stand up in court. Fit and finish is incredible. The sound system is very good (I wanted premium but settled for stock, and no complaints). I\\'ve been doing the conventional break-in (vary your speed) and still averaging 27 mpg. Overall I\\'d have to say this is the finest car I\\'ve ever owned. If I win the lottery, I\\'m going for an A8, but still keeping my A3! Wow I wanted a 4-door hatchback for flexibility but didn\\'t want to compromise on performance or drive a huge wagon around. There are a lot of sedans in this price range, but the hatch and folding seats give much more utility. I settled firmly on the 2.0T after reviews and test drives, even though it lacked AWD. I drove the 3.2 solely to prevent buyer\\'s remorse and curiosity afterwards, and that was the one I had to get. Outside the trip I took to break it in, I\\'ve put more than 2K miles on it in 3 months and that is with restraint (daily commute is <10 miles RT).  It is much more fun to drive than my last car (01 Grand Prix GTP) and sometimes I drive past home and just keep going. Not what I expected... I bought my Audi about 9 month ago.  It is an ok car overall but very poor quality.  So far, I\\'ve replaced radiator, check engine light went on twice, and constantly have to add more oil to the car because \"Low Oil\" light goes on.  These are just major problems.  It is still fun to drive (when it is not in the shop) but it doesn\\'t perform as new anymore.   Another thing to mention is fuel economy.  I though it would be an economical car.  The gas mileage is great on the highway ( about 29 mpg) and is horrible in the city and stop and go traffic, where I get about 15 mpg!!  Considering that you have to buy premium gas, there\\'s no savings.  Also, the car is very loud and noisy. A3: Best in its class. I drove the 3.2 All-Wheel drive but preferred the 2.0T.  The 2.0T was more responsive and felt torquier down low. Impressive after coming from a VR6 GTI.  I wasn\\'t sure I could give up the MT for the DSG but after driving the car for a couple of days there was no going back to a MT for me. I drove this car back to back with a Mazdaspeed3 and with the DSG I could drive the A3 faster than the Mazda on the same course.  The A3 is just too easy to drive fast with DSG.  There is some road noise as others have commented on which I atribute to the tires and stiff sport suspension.  The ride is very good given the handling abilities of the car. The fit and finish is first in its class. Audi nailed this car! Have only had this car for a week, but I have already put it through its paces.  I\\'m impressed!  It handles like it is bolted to the road.  I have taken twisties at insane speeds and this car hasn\\'t broken a sweat.  Combine this competence with a basic but flawless interior, a great stereo, very good gas mileage and totally solid build quality and I just can\\'t see what Audi could\\'ve improved.  They completely naile this one!  If I ever get tired of driving this car, you best believe I will be seriously considering another Audi! An \"Adult\" Kind Of Giddy Okay, so I just bought my new A3 3.2 AWD Quattro today after driving the Volvo S40 T5 and the Acura TL-S.  The Volvo was nice, but not in the same class, and the Acura was a great car, but a bit bigger than I wanted.  The Audi is an awesome car.  So much fun.  Some folks say that the power gain in the 3.2 isn\\'t worth the increased price.  My feeling (having driven both) is that the 3.2 provides a much more steady power (no lag) and is better suited to the AWD.  I felt the same way when I chose my VW GTI VR6 over the 1.8T a few years back.  Steady power from the very low RPMs.  Beyond that, the build quality is great, the nav system is awesome, and I\\'m smiling! The Greatest Sleeper I traded an 04 R32 for the A3 and haven\\'t been disappointed yet.  It has good performance and is fun to drive fast or slow.  DSG is just great.   Fun little guy! I love this car, we dumped our Touareg off and never looked back. That thing was cursed! Our A3 is a great addition to our garage, utility, and fun at the same time. If you are over 6\\'3\" I would go bigger but  at 5\\'11\" I fit just fine. Totally recommend this car. Best In Class This fall will be two years in my A3 and this car is the best small car I have ever owned.  Great all season driver!! Think twice before you buy Since I bought my brand new car I never got more than 16 MPG, the gas cover got locked, the back of the front seat fell, it ran out of of oil more than 5 times, the 5th door froze and was impossible to open, the tires wore out - $1,000 to replace them! - the stick shift locks in the worst moments, it is so noisy inside you can not hear the radio, open the window when raining, all the water goes inside because of bad design, every time you want to open the front window, you open the rear one because of bad design. NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING - THIS IS EXPENSIVE JUNK!!   FUN! Black on black, manual, open sky premium pkg, cold-weather pkg, purchased in December \\'06 after much research. The fit and finish tipped the scales.   This car is such a blast to drive and gets noticed in traffic. Engine has great power, and the car handles like a dream. The traction control was put to the test during a recent ice storm and came through with flying colors. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy another.    Better than a 350Z My daily commute is 152 miles a day.  Its a little noisy on some roadways.  Overall it\\'s a blast to drive. I was recently driving through 40 mph winds at 75 mph and the car stayed glued to the road. Front wheel drive handles well in the snow. 6 months and going strong After 6 months and various trips and weather conditions the DSG A3 keeps going strong. With regular DSG manual shift mode or \"S\" auto mode we see 24-26 MPG regularly. Unsolicited guests comment on the smooth shifts and strong acceleration. 80 MPH comes too easily on crowded highway jaunts with minimal road noise - keep an eye on the speedometer in Ohio. Snow saw the traction control readily as the wide Pirellis floated and spun. May need winter snows if really interested. Quattro would be nice with the 2.0T. Saw the \"check engine light\" after a severe temp swing but several key starts apparently reset it before the dealer got a shot. Near 7000 miles and no warranty returns. Fun and sporty. Perfect marriage of trans and engine As the owner of an \\'05 S4 Cabrio, I am a bit spoiled. When it came time to buy a winter and commuting car, I decided to test drive the A3 2.0T with DSG. Honestly, I am not sure which car is more fun to drive! The DSG is such a seamless AT that the car just wants to go, and has almost undetectable shift lag. Put that together with the supreb handling, unparalleled Audi cabin, and high fit and finish overall, and you have one sweet little ride. The hatch and knock-down back seats make it a pretty versatile car as well. My 14 year old keeps telling me about all the chips and performance equipment we could throw at it, but why bother? It runs circles around most cars on the road as it is. What? This has a back seat and hatch? Torque steer is nearly absent, dive/squat is absent.  Nice power, but could probably use another 30hp. Good pulling power down low for a turbo.  Turbo lag is absent. DSG needs to be revised so that it holds the gear at redline in manual mode. Brakes are intially soft which dosen\\'t inspire much confidence.  However, the car is extremely well balanced for a front wheel drive car and is very, very fun to drive.  Rear cup holders are useless and frail.  Otherwise the interior is very thoughtfully organized.  Needs MP3 aux. input in base stereo.   A3 - what a car When I first saw this car I wasn\\x92t in the market for a new car. I was driving a GTI 2002 and was pretty happy with it until I saw the A3 and fell in love with the looks. Then I drove it, wow!!! No other car has the full time all wheel drive and this much power to boot. The transmission is outstanding. You just point it in the direction you want it to go and it goes with precision handling, dry or wet surface. And sport mode brings the car to another level. I am a big fan of a good 6 speed manual transmission, until I drove this car in sports mode. Everything a manual transmission does without the human error. Perfection. I can\\x92t wait for an S3 or an SR3, hoping it will come out. What a Car!   Like others, I got rid of my SUV but still wanted a \"hauler\".  I have loved the A3 since I first saw it and the test drive was great.  The car is amazing.  Look out!  In first the tires squeal.  The power (and efficiency) of the 4 cyl is amazing.  The DSG is a great fun.  Once driving, a guy in a Mercedes followed me to a stop light to tell me what a \"cool\" car it is.  The nav system, while a bit complicated, is great.  How did I live without it before?  Great car.  I\\'d recommend it to anyone.  Kill your SUV and get this.  You\\'ll be glad you did.  Don\\'t let anyone call it a \"wagon\".   A3 Seat Time - Never enough Test drove Honda, Subaru Outback, Mazda CX 7.  Drove the A3 and knew this was the car for us (well, it\\'s actually my wife\\'s car).  We live in an area where straight roads are rare and curves are the majority.  The 6 speed manual is the smoothest and easiest I have ever driven.  Living in the mountains, I vowed never to own a 4 cylinder car.  But the 2.0 Turbo climbs up long grades in 6th gear with no problem.  Steeper grades I have to shift between 3rd, 4th and 5th gears and that just means I am in for whole lot of fun.  My wife calls this my mid-life crisis car but she looks pretty hot driving it herself.   Just Awesome Bought the car with DSG, premium and open sky. Red exterior, black interior. The car looks hot, people stare at it all the time. Great performance, great pickup. The   mileage has been great so far, going to tahoe from the bay I avg 29.3, coming down I did 28.5 (i was going a little faster). I\\'m 6\\'3\" and fit well, don\\'t have a whole lot of head room, but it\\'s not an issue. Wish the trunk was a little bigger so my dog could fit a little better (great dane mix), but folding the seats will take car of that. Too bad it doesn\\'t come with quattro in the 2.0T. I would highly recommend this car, it just puts a huge smile on my face everytime I take a turn or press the accelerator.   In the pocket Tired of the stiff ride in my Crossfire, I needed a bit more room and ease of entry. Enter the A3. Just as fast with a turbo 4 banger as the XFire, and a \"softer\" sporty ride. Quicker than my wife\\'s 2001 TT, the A3 can pass life\\'s slowpokes with ease, yet makes for a nice \"everyday\" ride. I can get all the nine luggage pieces of my drum set in easily with the rear seats folded down...and still have room for a friend. Great car for city, highway or the twisties when you can. A month of driving the A3 and it\\'s still love! Speeding in SF A great car that combines function with fun. I\\'ve had my A3 for about a month and couldn\\'t be more happy.  The 200 HP engine and DSG live up too the hype, and man, does it fly.  The interior is spacious, comfortable, with a clean design. We searched most entry-level luxury sedans but the A3 was the clear winner - nothing even compared to the driving performance of the A3.  You wouldn\\'t know if from the inside, but the car has a ver small footprint, ideal for city driving and parking. Little Car, No Compromise Third Audi, coming on the heels of a 2001 TT and an \\'03 A4.  This is the Goldilocks car:  not too small, not too big, just right.  Our commute got shorter this year, so this is basically a city car.  Shopped the 330i, the IS 350, the new A4, and the G35.  Loved the A3\\'s functionality and nimble, cut-and-thrust attitude. Pound for pound... This is my forth Audi, through All Roads and A-4 Avants. $ for $ and pound for pound the best car Audi makes excepting for the discontinued All Road and the A-4 Cabrolet converible which is some $ 12K more expensive to equip.  I can do 35-37 mpg with a wax job and no head winds, so I can barely eek out 550 miles to a 13 gallon fill before hitting reserve, but if you want to hold 80 mph on 65 mph interstates and zip past some others in the passing lane, the economy will still hold 28 to 30 mpg. While it does not have some of the useless \"bells and whistles\" of the A-4 cousin, it\\'s all all around functional car with plenty of storage.  Suggest you buy Continental Extreme Contacts, a great all season/snow tire with smoother ride. Redefining the Pocket Rocket!  What a blast to drive! Short story \\x96 I needed to trade in the 330CIC and get something a little more practical as I was losing my winter driver (16 yr old got her permit) and my wife wouldn\\x92t dare part with her MDX. After a lengthy search I decided to go back to Audi (have owned 3 in the past) to drive the A4. I noticed the A3 and it was love at first stomp on the gas peddle!  The DSG is unreal (paddles are fun), pick-up (turbo lag? NOT) is explosive and car is extremely comfortable. Gas mileage is great (30.5 on a recent road trip) & the creature comforts are nice (open sky, cold wthr, premium pkgs. Awesome convertible - Tricky transmission* This is my first Audi. I had a VW Polo before that I really loved and this Audi rides even better (sure more power, better transmission....). My biggest concern about this car is the transmission while maneuvering. most specifically when shifting from Reverse to Drive, it always makes a funny noise and you can feel that something went wrong. After a while you get used to it and if you are patient enough to wait 3 seconds it wont happen. I was really surprise that nobody reported this issue on the previous reviews. Different from what most people say about not using the back seat, I have a 19 months baby that loves to ride with the top down. Yes, space is limited but you have to keep that in mind and use a larger car on longer trips. The quality of the materials are SUPERB!! Everything is extremely easy to use and perfectly located. Driving it on back roads is an awesome and relaxing experience. The short wheelbase, powerful engine and excellent suspension makes you feel like you are driving a Formula 1. It hugs the asphalt on every curve and the feedback from the steering wheel is outstanding. This is my 2nd year with the car and I\\'m loving everything about it. Great but Place of CD poor CD should be like the A5. Putting it inside the glove compartment is poor.  The blind or land change light is excellent !!!!   The change to your songs is poor. This too should be put in your glove compartment not in the instrument next to your hand.  That part should be open to keys etc.  My A5 was far better !!! Love my Audi! I absolutely love the way my new car hugs the road when I drive.  It drives like a dream!  The stereo is great too, I can hear it perfectly clear with the top down! Empty Nesters Love 2016 Audi Cabriolet Wife and I are \"empty nesters,\" making the A3 cabriolet perfect for us. The ride is quiet, sufficiently powerful and \"luxury smooth.\" The standard leather seats are very comfortable. The inside is laid out thoughtfully and everything is accessed conveniently. Car is quite handsome with top up or down and the convertible top is incredibly easy to operate in all respects. The Audi 3 seems to have all the latest technology---as much as I could possibly need and deal with. The ability to leave my iPod home and enjoy all my music from a custom-loaded, tiny sound card is just one of the many very nice little extras I discovered after buying this car.The windscreen is a great standard feature that is remarkably effective in minimizing the wind inside the cabin---wife thankfully no longer needs to put the windows up when the top is down in order to protect her hairdo. Only oddity is that power seats are not available at any price---no problem for us, though, since I am pretty much the only driver. The car is a bit pricey but the quality seems to be there and I\\'ve learned that you get only what you pay for. Thus, I\\'m confident this A3 cabriolet will be a durable and reliable car for us for many years to come. It is truly a pleasure to drive and I\\'m quite proud to be seen in it.     Twenty Months Post Purchase: I’ve now owned this car for about 20 months and my opinion, above, is confirmed by my 20 months of ownership. One caveat to my opinion: My Audi is stored throughout the winter months. Therefore, my experience is based upon May through November driving, only. I can’t comment on winter performance.       Also, the complementary service included with the purchase of this car is minimal, at least when I purchased it. Only the first oil change is complementary and prices for everything at Audi are quite steep, as they are with most Euro luxury brands.      Nevertheless, all things considered, I’d buy this car again and continue to be very proud of it and pleased with it.      Updating today, 7/2/2018, after two years and a few months of ownership. I store the car in winter and drive sparingly in summer. Thus, barely 5,000 miles on odometer. That said, no problems at all. Still enjoying the car very much. Totally reliable. Learning of its oddities, like when you drop the top, the windows automatically go up, not down! When you play music from the SD card, you have re-check the shuffle option every time you turn the engine off and re-start. You have to spend money to change the brake fluid after two years, even though you have only 4500 miles on the car? Other than such oddities, I\\'m perfectly pleased with the car and plan to keep it either until things begin to act up or the styling changes significantly. Rumor has it that this A3 cabriolet model and the A5 cabriolet will soon be discontinued and a new A4 convertible will replace both of them. My guess is that if this happens at all, it won\\'t be for at least a few years. Then, I\\'ll probably get the new model. But for now, I\\'m perfectly pleased with this beautiful red convertible. Fantastic! This car is classy and so much fun to drive. The A3 is for someone who wants luxury and affordability. Great car, but needs improvement I\\'m the biggest Audi fan - they\\'re all I drive. When I bought this car I was so excited since it was beautiful and such a great deal. However, as sad as I am to admit it, the car has some major flaws. You wouldn\\'t think there\\'d be blind spots in this car, but they\\'re extremely dangerous. They designed the side mirrors to look sleek and sporty, but they\\'re so small you can\\'t see much at all. I had to purchase stick-on blind spot mirrors in order to be able to switch lanes. Anyone that drives my car has the same complaint. Also, the wipers don\\'t go hardly fast enough in the rain. There\\'s been times I\\'ve had to pull over because I couldn\\'t see in a normal rainstorm. I never had this problem with my past Audis. Also, within the first year it broke down three times and had to go back to Audi to be fixed. The turbo leaked into the engine, a pipe started disintegrating, and a spark plug clogged - all within the first year. I leased the car so Audi fixed it for free but the fact that these many problems occurred when the car was brand new was extremely concerning. Otherwise the car does drive very well and gets decent mpg. I drive mostly highway to work each day and the mpg is from 30-33. The entertainment system and climate control are also great. Overall I sadly wouldn\\'t recommend this car - which is heartbreaking because I love Audi so much. Small Luxury at reasonable price After having BMWs to Audis (I even did a brief stint in a honda accord, yuck) I found this to be the most likable. I loved my a4 and s4, but due to older age, needed something brand new, didn\\'t want to sacrifice acceleration or comfort. The a3 is noticeably smaller than the a4 of today, same size as the a4 of previous generations. My wife and I fit up front perfectly and comfortably and my 100lb lab in the back. Plenty of trunk space. What attracts me is the fact that it still feels almost as fast as my b8 s4, with the fuel economy that doesn\\'t hurt the wallet. Really the only downside is getting black, I was her a lot. I urge any and everyone to just take a test drive, Great commuter car, fantastic weekend car to the country with the wonderful panoramic sunroof. Skip the nav, your iPhone can do everything anyways. Do get an upgraded stereo. I have basic (audi concert) it sucks when i want to jam I have it turned almost 85-90. Get bose or B&O. 2016 Audi A3 Love Mine! I was worried going from an A4 to an A3 but for the value I got for the price this car is perfect! Carlsbad Audi is awesome to work with. A Goldilocks car: just right! I was considering trading my 2014 S4 for a 2017 A4, but the annoying center display and contradictory options packages eliminated the A4. I then turned to the A3, which I had thought would be too small: I was wrong, at least for the way I use my car (mostly local driving, usually only with one passenger). I bought a 2.0 Quattro Premium Plus with the sport package, and it accelerates much better than I expected, nearly as well as my S4 did (being smaller and much lighter helps in that regard). As one expects of Audi, the fit and finish, inside and out, is excellent. As far as driving dynamics are concerned, it is very responsive and nimble, feeling much like my Porsche Boxster.Given its smaller size, it may not suit those who have to carry a lot of cargo, or those who have to carry more than one passenger. It may also not be the best car for those who drive a lot of highway miles, due to its short wheelbase. Overall, however, I recommend it highly to those people looking for a sporty, high quality smaller car. Pre-lease Test Drive Great car.  Waiting to see what 2017 has to offer as their standard. Bang for your buck This is my first Audi. I\\'ve always been a fan of the A3, even before it was changed to a sedan. When the sedan came out, I knew I was going to get that car. Although one of the bad things that this car is always dinged on - The Backseats - I have no complaints. Sure, it\\'s tight back there but I\\'m never in the back seats so I don\\'t really care that it\\'s small. Perky little engine! So much fun to drive. I can\\'t say that I\\'ve driven up the arroyo parkway at about 80-90 mph though.... lol The fuel mileage can be better but then again, I live in Los Angeles and it\\'s stop and go traffic at any point of the day. I have gotten great mileage when I hit an open road. Sound system is good. I feel like there\\'s a slight delay on initial accelaration but I may just have to tweak the settings to fix that.Overall, it\\'s a great car to drive and you get your monies worth. Great Car, Terrible Vibration This is a fantastic car with a fatal flaw: vibration.  I\\'m not talking about the normal \"small-car\" road feel.  (I\\'ve owned a 1-Series before, as well as a Saab 9-3 Aero).   This is car-manufactured vibration.   When I took the car to the dealership, I was told that 3 tires were \"out of round.\"   Audi of North America only approved replacement for 2.  The car is still vibrating at an unacceptable level for a car that costs this much--or really any price above 10K.   I will be calling to have it serviced again.  And it\\'s not just me.  There are vibration issues with a wide-array of A-3\\'s that include various types and in various nations (US, UK, etc.).  Check out: http://www.audiforums.com/forum/audi-a3-12/2015-a3-limo-noise-vibration-214549/page4/       The build quality in this car is simply poor.  How you ship a car with 3 defective tires and replace only 2 is beyond me.   Makes me wonder what else is off that could be causing the vibration.   The car is otherwise great: great steering, good acceleration, great MMI system, nice fit and finish.  But I would not buy this car again, and will never buy another Audi.  Going back to BMW.  \"Truth in Engineering\" turned out to be \"Lies in Engineering.\" Jose\\'s review  Most FUN car EVER! In my years of owning different cars, one car stands out as the most practical, the most fun, and provides the most absolute joy when driving. That one car is my 2008 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro with DSG. I have gone from (in order of ownership) 87 BMW 325iC to 99 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro to 02 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro to 05 Audi S4 Cabrio to 08 BMW Z4 Coupe (Sunday car) and 08 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro DSG (everyday car), owning the last two the same time. I was a bit torn deciding between the Z4 and A3 before I moved to Chicago. I decided I just need one car so I had to sell one of the two. Needless to say, I sold the Z4 and decided to keep the A3. Sure the Z4 was sexier, faster, and just had more prestige maybe for the lack of a better word, but overall, I simply thought the A3 was just the car to keep. I am glad I did. I didn\\'t want to regret giving up the A3 again. Rewind back to 2009, I actually owned a 2007 A3 3.2 Quattro DSG in 2007. After two years, Audi offered to buy it back from me, so I did sell it to Audi. It was a mistake because I really missed that car shortly after. And in the U.S. production stopped that year. So I went looking for another but none available -- not the A3 3.2 Quattro. So for some time I had the 08 BMW and I got myself a Subaru Tribeca as my everyday car. By chance I went looking for another A3 again in 2012 and found my now 08 Audi A3. Hallelujah!This Audi A3 is pure joy to drive. I have gotten out -- without digging around the car first -- of 19 inches of snow here in Chicago in the Blizzard of Super Bowl 2015; I have taken corners in this car that I probably would not dare take in any other car; I have gone up a circular freeway on-ramp at high speed enough to scare (and impress) my friend while he hung on for dear life to the \"Oh Sh!+\" handle; I have passed many cars on an uphill climb without the engine gasping for air. And what\\'s another thing that makes this car such a delight to drive? It\\'s that buttery and silky smooth dual sequential gearbox (DSG). Whether I\\'m driving in automatic mode, or sport mode, or manual with the option to switch gears with the stick or paddle shifters, the double-clutch transmission is so silky smooth and quick shifting up and down. Of course, when down shifting it may not feel smooth as the engine will roar down-shifting at high speed, but that engine sound sure is music to my ears.I know there are other cars that can outperform this car out there. But for the what I get out of this 5-door hatchback -- 250 HP, 255-lb torque, DSG transmission, just to name a few -- there\\'s no other car out there for me. I can now and honestly say, \"I love this car!\" Fun to drive. Poor to maintain. We bought 2008 A3 in 2015 with only 27000 miles on it.It is FUN to drive! It feels like a race horse wishing to run!  This thing is made for highway driving. It\\'s ability to accelerate and maneuver is the best I have ever felt.  That said, it is annoying to drive in city. The least little bit of pressure on accelerator causes it to jump, sometimes too far too fast!It is very uncomfortable / awkard to get in and out of, and I am an average size American guy (5\\'8, 200 lbs).  The worst aspect is the inability to find qualified, reliable mechanics who are willing to work on the vehicle.   I have owned Ford, Isuzu, Honda,  and Toyotas.  I never had an issue with find qualified mechanics with those brands. Here, it took awhile to find one outside of a dealership.  Audi has a management software that few mechanics have access to, and I live in south Florida, not middle of nowhere Montana, North Dakota,  etc.!Also, due to low profile,  going over any railroad tracks or potholes can be annoying at best, or expensive at worst. We went over one, and fractured the radiator support, which needed to be replaced.  I saw later that it was made completely of plastic!  How cheap!  A front-end structural support made of plastic,  how cheap on Audi! King of the Mountain Considering how many times a season I head up to the ski slopes here in Colorado a 4wd hatchback was a must.Coming from a Subaru family I started my search there, but was put off by the WRX\\'s insatiable need for speed.. however thanks to this site I stumbled upon the Audi A3 and haven\\'t looked back since.I\\'m able to hold highway speeds in the worst snowstorms and the A3 doesn\\'t even wiggle when charging through the midlane muck. Weaving in and out of traffic while pulling up I70 is a breeze, one swipe of the paddle shifter and I\\'m gone.But more-over, its the fit and finish that has won me over, everything is just as it should be and that coupled with the handling is pure eloquence. Fast, Fun, Reliable, and Comfortable! I have owned an Audi A3 for three years, and appreciate it more and more each day I drive it. The turbocharged 2.0T engine is very zippy and the short-throw 6-speed manual transmission makes driving the A3 particularly fun,but what really sets the car apart from its competition is its fantastic handling. The car loves curves and the tires stick to the road like glue. From the moment the car accelerates onto an onramp, the solid feel of Audi\\'s suspension and quiet cabin give the passenger a sense of confidence at highway speeds. Even after three years of daily driving, nothing has broken on my A3 and its been to the shop only for its regularly scheduled and warranty-covered maintenance. A3 Is my bad boyfriend This car is all I ever wanted, fast, fun, charming, you don\\'t see as many of this on the streets so it is even more unique.  I call it my bad \"boyfriend\", I am so in love with it, I can\\'t move forward to another car and I know the car is a lot of trouble.  In a year in half that I have owned it, it had 2 problems, one with gas sensor and seal and today I am having jerking transmission and the dealer does not want to recognize it. I have read forums and a lot of people have experienced the same issue with the same dealer\\'s answer. Buy it, you will love it, but be careful it can break ur heart when you start having mechanical issues. I still love it even that is problem car! Think it over When I first bought this car I loved it! It is fun to drive, the stick shift is fast and with a few modifications this car can look nice. Good gas mileage, good sound system. I really like everything about this car except. It has given me so many problems. My car is only two years old now with 40,000 miles and currently in the shop again. My battery has gone bad after only two years! Unbelievable! I replaced the starter in the car twice, once at 8,000 miles and another at 20. Don\\'t know how long Audi will cover it but I think there might be a bigger problem causing it. I also replaced the stereo system because of a malfunction and the windshield wiper sensor (hazard with no ww in the rain Love Love Love It! I had to get a 4 door b/c I was pregnant but I wanted as close to a sports car w/4 doors as possible.  After much research and reading, I found the A3.  I am a true car junkie- grew up reading my dad\\'s car mags & this car does everything I need it to and more.  I have the S-Line & although I got the automatic instead of manual trans (hard to shift & find binkies), it is a blast to drive!  The acceleration esp when you go to pass is amazing- put your foot down &/or downshift & it just goes!  I know it\\'s a little small (I\\'m 5\\'2\") but my 6\\' husband & tall step kids all fit w/my Britax car seat.  I love the hatch & when the time comes, I\\'ll just get another one! I Love This Car! This car is an absolute riot!  The A3 is truly an Audi, truly a German automobile.  One might be inclined to assume that the bottom-of-the-line Audi is just that, a tepid facsimile of the brand.  On the contrary, the A3 possesses all of the presence and character of a complete European luxury machine.  I continue to be amazed with the build quality.  The driving experience is just phenomenal.  The engine note is something that must be experienced; you\\'d never guess a small five door could sound this wonderful.  I could gush unapologetically about the car for far more than 700 characters so I will conclude with this summation: This car is sick!!! Simply well done It was at the Atlanta Auto Show that I fell in love with the Audi A3.  My current car due end of its lease was a 2006 VW Touareg.  A wonderful SUV yet it was not something I would ever get again unless diesel was offered.  Simply put, small engine pulling around a heavy car.  Out of all the cars I saw that day, I decided the A3 was the one.  Next day I leased a metallic grey pearl, open sky, premium package, and s-tronic automatic.  The 2.0 engine, I believe, coupled with a flawless DSG will allow this car to drive well beyond 100,000 miles.  The Open Sky, while novel, and great if rear passengers are present, is very hot in the summer.   Tire noise destroys a good relationship I had read other reviews that indicated tire noise could be a problem, especially with the Pirelli P6 tires.  I thought I had escaped that fate as the first year was great; lot\\'s of fun to drive, average 32.5 mpg overall, reasonably peppy and good brakes and handling.  After the 16,000 miles service and tire rotation the tire howl began.  I returned to Audi service who tell me that alignment and suspension are in spec and the tires are cupped which is causing the road noise.  The noise has only gotten worse. Plenty of tread left but unless the Pirelli tire dealer I see Saturday does something to adjust this, I will have to report to Audi and Pirelli that they have lost a customer for life. Gets in its own way This is a great car if you like going to the dealer. Mechanically, it is perfect but the build quality is a disaster. Handles great, fast, average over 30 mpg in a mixed commute. Easy to park in the city. All of the doors have been taken apart for wiring harnesses being out of the clips. The radio was a mess. Seat belt receiver replaced, etc. Now I have 2 mystery rattles, the drivers door handle and an exhaust rattle.  Re-Review to BAD I posted a review after I bought my Audi last August raving about it.  I now wish to retract my raves!  The ride and fun level are all great...but I am burning thru a quart of oil about every 1000 - 1500 miles!  I can\\'t even make it to a regular oil change without the light coming on or me putting oil in it sometimes twice.  Terrible!  I am dumping this thing before it dies on me.  I drive 120 mile a day and can\\'t risk being left on the side of the road, Audi care or not!  I am going back to a Honda or Toyota...loved both!  Too bad, such a beautiful car. Great car This is my forth Audi. I\\'ve had two 5000\\'s an A6 quattro and now this 2008 A3 2.0T 6A. My wife drives it most of the time. We both love it. Have 11700 miles on it. No trouble at all. I highly recommend the ca. I would buy it over and over again After the fuel crunch I decided to get rid of my Mercedes E-500 AMG.  I looked for fun, reliability, some luxury, good dealer service and a car that was practical. And I found all of it in the A3. Tried the 3.2 version and it ws not much better. I love driving and commuting on my A3. Nothing fails and if you go on-line you can find a few \"easter-eggs\" that Audi engineers left as a gift in hiding. It handles like a sports sedan and hums like a sprts car. It is just the perfect car for the person with a few bucks, without the need to be a show-off. Problems with Audi With only 5,000 miles on my brand new A3, the power window is broken, the power seat for the driver is broken, and now the transmission is giving problems.  I will never buy another Audi again. This is the most problamatic car I have ever had, worst than the old Ford Explorer.  I am going to ask for a refund.   Fun, Practical, and Cool! Having driven my A3 for 7+ months now, I am very happy with this purchase. My previous car was a Subaru WRX, which made me consider what I would give up in performance with an A3. Well, now I realize that for 99% of my driving, the Audi provides more than what I need. (That 1% is pushing it beyond my comfort zone anyways.) The A3 gives you refined power and handling. It is a smart blend of style and practical considerations in a sports sedan. It has been a very responsive, comfortable, and rewarding driving experience.  Love the A3! This is my 7th Audi including A4s and a TT. I love this car! The 2.0 engine is a tremendous improvement over the old 1.8. The A3 is quick, has great handling, is nicely appointed and is a kick to drive. New car pricing is a bit hefty, but I bought mine at the end of the year and saved a lot. In \\'08, if you wanted AWD you had to buy the 3.2L engine, and the price got pretty high.  I understand that they are working on the pricing issue for \\'09.  My wife has an Acura MDX, but now she\\'s borrowing the A3 whenever she can grab it.   This is one bad little car First road trip with the car using sport shifting with the dsg and was completely gobsmacked by the performance of this car. Goes like stink, handles the curves like it\\'s nobody\\'s business and that transmisssion is without a doubt the best in the world and worth the extra cash. Throw the back seats down, throw the dog in, and off you go. Lots of room for two with luggage and that\\'s all you need. Gas mileage is superb for a car with this performance. Too bad is has to be high test but you can\\'t get everything. Ipod setup is easy but info on instrument panel could be a little more informational and clearer. But just go drive (faster if possible) you will love this car Excellent, Fun Car for the Money! This is a great car, and I have had plenty to compare it to. I also own a Prius, which I kept, but I wanted a \"fun\" car, and I got that. I know everyone raves about the automatic, but frankly I love the stick shift. It is very responsive, and once you get use to the great distance the clutch goes in (I am only 5\\'4\") shifting is very smooth!  I have an hour drive to and from work everyday, and this has made it a pleasure! Sports Car plus  I wanted a sports coupe, but couldn\\'t live without a backseat and some cargo space. The A3 completely fits the bill. Great engine; amazing transmission; handles like it\\'s on rails.   Small size makes it tossable and zoom with an efficient engine, but the A3\\'s real secret weapon is the practical space.  Audi doesn\\'t want you to know this, but the back seat in the A3 is bigger than that in the A4. My kids love it!  True, it is not a bargain, if you price things on a per-inch basis, but if you value things because of how good they are, not just how big, you will love this car. Great Car! After owning several Audi vehicles, I can say that i\\'m a big Audi fan. So, when it was time to change my car again, I took to my local Audi dealer for my base model A3 with DSG. This car is great and I saved a good amount of money by not choosing many costly options. I\\'m pretty much happy with all standart equipment such as dual A/C, great stereo, excelent transmission, well designed and built interior and exterior.  If you want a Audi vehicle, beware of costly options. This car can go well over $30k with a few check marks on the option list.  Oh, did I mention how great the gas mileage is? Overall a great car I test drove many vehicles for about 6 months.  Between them were BMW 328x & 335x, Acura RDX, BMW X3, Infiniti G35x and Lexus IS 250 AWD. Audi A3 overall had all the features that I wanted, AWD, cargo flexibility, compact size, powerful engine and a good level of luxury.  The A3 is impressive the way it handles. Coming from a previous S4 I was worried that the car wouldn\\'t satisfy me but it has proved me wrong. I like this vehicle more and more as a continue to drive it.  Nice compromise between GTI and BMW 3 My Audi A3 6MT is a blast to drive. It has mostly every feature I could ever want. It gets great mileage, is comfortable, fun, sexy. If you\\'re looking at a cheap BMW 3 series, but don\\'t want to spend $38K to get the options you want, but don\\'t want to settle for a VW, then this is the car for you. Audi really knows what they are doing!   The big little German  I\\'ve had this car now for a few months and am still impressed. I reviewed all the others in its class with extensive test drives for its competitors. The package is unmatched - performance, looks, build quality. This is the sexiest wagon on the road bar none.  Strong selling points were: Great gas mileage 26/31 (actual). Adaptive lighting - to be able to see that deer around the corner before you hit it.  DSG - Audi Innovation. Super smooth - six speed.  Speed sensitive steering - No other car in its class has this. Overall, very few do. Easy steering in the parking lot that tightens as you go faster. Blue Sky package. Top notch audio - stock system rock too.  Price/performance Why didn\\'t I buy one sooner? Having been a BMW loyalist the last 8 years, buying a hatchback from Audi was a huge leap of faith.  It was, however, the best decision I could have made.  If you don\\'t get silly with some of the options, this vehicle provides the optimum balance of performance, fuel economy, prestige, utility, and comfort.  There are plenty of other cars that do each of these better, but the whole of the A3 is greater than the sum of its parts.  Taking off ramps at 25+ MPH gives me the same giddiness as my last BMW did. It turns heads, and the interior is extremely well thought out. The trunk holds a lot of space, the mileage it gets is quite respectable, and it turns heads wherever I drive. 1-Year Update on A3 2.0T DSG I\\'m nearing 1 year of ownership!  Haven\\'t put on many miles (13k), but most were hard miles through Boston. Car was outstanding in the winter, traction control and stability performed very nicely. I was considering the Quattro when I bought it, but now I\\'m glad I didn\\'t spend the extra 8k, it\\'s not worth it. No mechanical problems to speak of.  I found out that a golf bag won\\'t fit in the back without putting the seat down.  Maybe time to upgrade to an A4 Wagon? If only it had the A3 interior. Oh yea, and for those confused by the fact you can\\'t tilt the windshield wipers up in the winter before a storm, turn the car off then hit the wiper lever, they come half way up!      Looking for comfortable seats? I love this car.  Really fun to drive, sticks like glue to curves, great visibility, sporty but comfortable driving experience.  I test drove a lot of small cars before deciding on this one, and preferred it to the A4. Awesome car This is an awesome car and fun to drive.  Would recommend this over 3 series any day.  Shifting is really smooth and the acceleration is great, got upgraded stereo and S-line package and I feel it was worth the money... stiffer seats/suspension.  Heated seats work great and the AC cools down nice and quickly. Perfect City Car; Compact Luxury. After years with an A4 Avant, this has not been a step down at all! I figured I would be sacrificing space and luxury for MPG and the convenience of a compact, but not really the case; roomy interior and meticulous detail (I could live without the carbon fiber trim look, however). Way easier to park in the city, better mileage, and far quicker than the A4. Overall, if you don\\'t need the Quattro I can\\'t see a reason to get a new A4 Avant when this option is out there.     Refinement and Invigoration in One Just purchased my A3, and after driving about town a bit now, I can say with certainty that this is a unique ride. Just like BMWs seem to combine refinement with performance, this car does the same, with a bit more raw feeling, less cush.  If you are even thinking about a BMW, or one of the many alternative, do not let the A3 slip your list, this car is great! It\\'s like play toy that has all the creature comforts you could want. Not worth the money Needed a hatchback for our big dog. At least got that goal accomplished. Other than that: short gear ratios (2,500 rpm at 60mph) ruin the gas mileage. No fun at all on highway / interstate. What is the point putting the GTI gearbox (built for 16 year olds) in an Audi? Same audience? Car seems to have some kind of slope sensor. Transmission doesn\\'t shift up when going up hill. Car runs uphill at 3,000 rpm and need shift manually i.o. to save gas. DSG transmission is nice but hypersensitive. It\\'s a roller coaster ride when car is cold. A/C has a mind of it\\'s own and takes a scientist to operate. Blower keeps changing speed. No homelink. No self-contained sun visor upgrade available.  Quattro for life Bullet fast. Sticks to the road like glue. Modern interior design. Awesome sound system. Torque and horsepower to spare. Quattro all wheel drive.  This car is worth every penny, and is truly a driver\\'s car. The A3 3.2 is a total blast to drive. Spent the better part of 1 year comparing the A3 3.2 Quattro to the IS 250 AWD, Infiniti G35, Acura TL, and the BMW 325xi. The Audi is the thinking man\\'s BMW, whatever that means.  Gas mileage not all that great, but nobody buys a 250 hp v6 for the gas mileage... you buy it for the big grin it puts on your face when you hammer the throttle.  I love this car, go buy one now! Buy this car now. Great car. Driver\\'s car. Not floaty like IS 250 or G35.  Very responsive, fast, engine has a very nice growl to it.  Quattro is unmatched, do the research.  3.2 liter engine + Quattro = 0-60 in 5.9 at least. Tons of great standard options such as autodimming mirrors, bose upgraded audio system, rain sensing wipers. I love this car.  Just bought this car and its a blast! We came on the lot looking for an A4 and drove off with this one instead. The baseline A3 is pretty boring, but the S-Line is amazing! The Blue Sky package makes this car look very unique. Also got Sirius radio with the Bose audio package. The sound couldn\\'t be any more clear. We\\'ll follow-up if anything bad happens, but so far so awesome! If you go to Audi of Tysons Corner, make sure you ask for Ron! Very cool guy and extremely low intensity. Fun and Thrilling to Drive Just a little time with this car, but it has proven to be an excellent upgrade from my typical conservative Japanese sedan class of cars that I have driven for years.  Fun, sporty, economical (best gas mileage in the class) and the engine and transmission are amazing.   Great so far! Had the car a little more than 3 weeks.  2.0T w/ S-Line.  Test drove the 3.2 but it felt too heavy with the 6 cyl. and quattro.  Plenty of kick in the 4 cyl.  The S Tronic shifters are responsive and addictive. Nice ride, but it will cost you Akin to what another reviewer described - the A3 is a great driving car, too much fun (as evidenced by multiple speeding tickets).But... I\\'ve gotten to know my service dealer a little too well.Driver\\'s seat fell apart - warranty-covered fix.Fuse box melted - warranty covered that.It\\'s a turbocharged car, so you have to replace the spark plugs every 30k mi.  It didn\\'t help that the injector coil also went out on me.  Ugh.Now at 80k miles, the engine light is going on, and there\\'s no identifiable reason.  The engine was cleaned out (pistons), various valves and manifolds were replaced, yet after $900 in repairs, it\\'s still messed up with the engine light brightening my interior lighting. The 25k/50k/75k services at the dealer ran about $500-$700. Oil changes run $100.  Premium fuel.  No off-dealer maintenance shop will replace the transmission fluid as that\\'s Audi special. My next car will be a Mazda - all the same driving fun, with less costly repairs. Looks good but constant minor issues My 2009 Audi A3 driver side door does not work with the fob. The other doors work fine. The shop says the door lock actuator needs to be replaced total cost $750!\\r The low oil light keeps on popping up. I have not gotten an estimate and will wait until my 105k maintenance. \\r The car looks and drives well. Also, the MPG is pretty good even on Premium gas. However my old and ancient Camry seems to have less constant minor issues.  Not Reliable...Never Again! Just after warranty, the manifold went bad.The injectors went bad.After five years of ownership the main engine seal and the oil separator went bad ($2,000) and the fuse housing under the hood melted ($675).I have been driving for 32 years and I have gotten bad gasoline with this car twice.Never before in 32 years has that occurred.The car is over engineered and too temperamental.VW\\'s I\\'ve owned were also unreliable.If you have plenty of money and time to spend at the shop, you may consider this a fun car.  a year and 30k miles in my A3 I bought my 09 A3(2.0T w/S-tronic) in July 2012, with 51k miles, now has 81k miles. MPG has actually gotten better, and I routinely get over 30 commuting to work(22 miles one way). Had to replace the electronic throttle, but other than that, I\\'ve spent $2.5k on regular maintenance--tune up, oil changes, brakes, tires. The seatbacks came unglued, so i simply super-glued them back together, with no issues. The armrest also came undone, but to replace the top portion, it will cost me $200, so that will also be super-glued back.I will consider the 2015 A3 when it arrives, though i\\'ll also be cross-shopping with the Volvo V60(soon to arrive), and the new GTI. A GTI in a suit I needed to replace my 11 year old TT roadster with a larger car.I was looking at 2-3 year old A4 Avants but they were too expensive.Last week I bought an A3 used with 30k on the odometer.I just finished a 1000 mile road trip in 100+ degree heat at an average speed of 85 mph without a single problem.Great power from the 2.0 turbo that emits a wonderful snarl when you floor it and the dual clutch transmission is an able dance partner in the twisties.The dual zone AC kept the cabin of my black on black skyroof equipped A3 cool and comfortable while we cruised through the Mojave desert and the engine temp needle never budged past the middle of the dial.Great little car! 2008 A3 2.0T (DSG) uses way too much oil! I am afraid to drive it a considerable amount of distance..I check the oil one day, and although remarkably dirty,its full. The next day I drive it 100 miles give or take..when I get home I have NO OIL, and there was no alert telling me that the oil is low!!I have taken it back to my Audi dealership 3 times and it is going back for #4.One more chance!otherwise this is a great car. I\\'d rather not sell it because of the poor treatment that I receive at the Audi dealership that I use.Come on Audi. Once we buy your car - we are family!Service Managers need to treat us better!! Audi drivers want performance,high quality, and 6 star treatment!!!thanks! nan Before I purchased my A3, I had been longing for an Audi for quite some time. Dealer made the new A3 more financially attractive than a low-mileage A4 from the prior model year. I have not regretted my decision and now have ~17,000 mi. on the car. No major mechanical problems. No quality issues except for poorly tracking sun-roof shade.The engine is peppy. There IS turbo lag, contrary to what some critics have said, but the torque band is band is broad and smooth once it is engaged. DSG works nicely and allows driver to drive all speeds in manual fashion. Lovely steering wheel. Intuitive gauge placement. Supportive seats, although more side bolstering would be nice. Love the QUATTRO. Fun Fast Practical - One Package Satisfaction on a car purchase is all about previous experience and expectations. Previous: I\\'ve owned BMW\\'s (328is, 528i). Mercedes (E350), Lexus (GX470).  Love the tightness of a German car, combo sport and luxury. Need: I drive 15k/year, mostly highway with some 2 lane windy roads.  My 528i had 160k miles, facing $5k on brakes, airbag sensor, struts, etc.  I was also getting about 23mpg.  Wanted something fun, fast with good mpg and room for family (wife, 2 girls). Enter A3: This car is about as perfect (based on my expectations/needs) as one can get.  It is tighter than the BMW\\'s, fast and fun.  30mpg - driven hard.  Sunroof, stereo, leather seats, bluetooth all create luxury feel. First import for my garage Coming from a Chevy-only-world I could not be any happier.  Power, style, handling, it\\'s all there in spades. The combination of redesigned 2.0T-TFSI, DSG transmission and Haldex AWD is amazing.  It is so fun to drive I find myself taking the long-way home almost every day.  And the hatch makes it extremely practical.  My dog loves cruising around, grinning at everyone through the back window.  And the folding back seats have made room for a new grill, small patio set and almost everything I need to haul.  On top of all this the A3 is top-rated for safety and sips so little gas I have no concerns with non-stop spirited driving.  3rd audi Went to my local dealer and drove a 2009 A3 2.0 quattro with bluetooth, open sky, and satellite radio.  Even though I thought I wanted a manual again I got such a good deal plus really wanting quattro I bought the 09.  The DSG transmission is growing on me.  I have always maintained my Audi\\'s and never had any reliability issues other than normal wear and tear items.  The A3 is well built and is versatile.  It is a perfect car for running errands in town but also does well on longer trips.  Great sporty car I loved this car. I just turned it in this weekend for my 3rd Audi in three years. I needed a bigger car for the family so I went with an A6. I have owned BMW\\'s, VW\\'s, Mercedes, Ford\\'s, Chevy\\'s, & Toyota\\'s. Audi\\'s are by far the best as far as I am concerned.  I custom ordered it from Audi with the options I wanted (convenience pckg, open sky, cold weather, s-line). It has great pep for a 4 cylinder turbo. I added H & R sport spring and bilstein shocks to it and wow was this car a fun car to drive. I love Audi\\'s design of the new \\'09\\'s and the LED\\'s speak for themselves.  Don\\'t buy  So much for German engineering; they have not discovered aluminium. All the interior design is in plastic with silly parts that break and are not covered by the warranty. I used the back seat arm rest once and it broke; I plugged an ipod in the cigarette lighter and it broke; the two moon light roof hatches broke; the bolt that holds the spare tire broke, etc. In addition, the car gets a check engine light every six months (and deal with the service people.) It\\'s the only brand that charges for rental car while on service, contrary to what they said at purchase. Entry Level Luxury A well conceived vehicle. Lots of utility with a great mix of style, luxury, comfort, sport and utility. Perfect for people who live in large urban cities.   Best deal for your money I live in San Francisco and the A3 is the perfect size to park anywhere. Gives great gas mileage and takes off quick without the whiplash. I love the smooth transmission. One down fall would be the temperature controls. The knobs take awhile to adjust the temp. You have to turn it click per click or hold it a while to go from cold to hot. But other then that I love my Audi A3. Loving It For 2 Months Now Picked up an \\'09 A3 2.0T Quattro DSG in January.  Now that it\\'s broken in & I\\'ve started pushing it, I\\'m very impressed with the performance.  The auto shift is flawless & returns decent fuel economy (about 22mpg in city so far), but when pushed (or in Sport mode), this car can go.  Punch it when you need to pass & you\\'re smoothly up to 80+ before you know it.  Exterior & interior fit/styling have been excellent w/ no issues to-date.  The only minor flaws I\\'ve come across are the floor mats (not very wear or stain resistant), how the bright yellow passenger airbag off indicator stands out from the rest of the dash lights, & the lack of small storage compartments for coins or other. Great car Bought \\'09 A3 quattro s-line with DSG. Options not chosen are sport package and audio package. Too much money for 6-disc and sport sport package includes things I do not want to pay for. Great car, but 6-disk should come standard for $40K. Quattro is seamless. Performance is very good but so far gas mileage is not what I expected - but only have 5500K so far. Hope it gets better with time. Quality of materials is good but fear that paint is not up to Canadian winters (or summers). Already have chips and scratches. No USB connections. Fun and Style Purchase my A3 six manual with convenience pkg, cold weather, sky, Sport pkg, titanium pkg. I think is worth every dollar spent. Fast, solid and very comfortable to drive. Got 2000 miles and I love it so far, is fast, great in snow, cornering, steering and brakes, sound Bose system is superb, is the best car I ever bought. Who needs memory seats? How many times you use them? Is built right ! Great car, poor execution of technology I just picked up my car last week.  Having driven VW for over 15 years in the 80\\'s and 90\\'s, I knew exactly what to expect. The engine is amazing, the S-tronic (DSG) transmission is fabulous, mileage has been great right out of the box. I am left scratching my head trying to figure out how a $34K car can be missing so many things that were on my $23 Kia three years ago!  Auto headlamps, auto-dimming rearview mirror, integrated garage door opener, remote starting available (it\\'s not!).  Also, no memory positions for seats & mirrors.  These are items that you shouldn\\'t even have to talk about in 2009!  A great car; highly recommended IF you can deal with these oversights from Audi. Dream Drivetrain Finally Available  I\\'ve had my eyes on this car since it first made it to the US for the 2006 model year, but was always frustrated by the lack of availability of the 2.0T with quattro. I was looking for a great car to downsize and go more fuel-efficient without having to sacrifice. When I found out that the 2.0T was going to be available with quattro for 2009, I placed an order in June and have had my car for 2 months now. Couldn\\'t love it more. It is a blast to drive and makes you want to drive more. The engine is peppy and very refined for a 4-cylinder turbo. The handling is firm and sporty. The ride is remarkably composed for a small car and firmly planted. Oh, and it looks great inside and out.  Great Improvements Made for 2009 We\\'ve had our A3 for about 3 weeks and love it. We custom ordered it in June. The car is similar to previous 2008 models except almost all the suggestions from previous years have been implemented. It now has modern interior materials/buttons, sporty front end like the A4. Mirror turn signals, and AUX input for the iPod, nicer computer in dash etc. The stereo also plays MP3 discs. Ours has bluetooth as well which is now part of the S-line pkg. For those thinking of getting a GTI, please drive the A3 too. It is not that much more money but is a much better car. There are also a couple of new colors which some people might prefer.  A great ride This vehicle (an \\'06) has been very reliable and versatile. It handles great, looks great, and hauls the mail when you want it to. MPG is about 30 on the highway. Cargo space with the back seat down is amazing. It did have more highway cabin noise than I would have liked during the first few years. A switch to Continental Pro Contact tires along with precision alignment took care of that. This car needs precise alignment, not just \"within specs.\" I highly recommend this one. Sporty & Practical I cross shopped this car against the Subaru Legacy GT/ WRX, and Audi S4 V8. The Legacy felt bland and the WRX unrefined. While the V8 S4 with it\\'s 300hp was the best motor, the interior was small and the A3\\'s hatchback trumps it for practicality. The A3 S-line comes with all the bells and whistles: Sirius XM, Bluetooth, heated driver and passenger seats, twin glass roofs, self leveling HID lights etc. Audi continues to make cars with handsome interiors. Of course the famed Quattro drive makes winter driving a breeze. Performance is brisk for 250Hp and launches are surefooted with AWD. Brakes haul down the car in an instant with little fade.  Love My A3 I bought my car in November 05 when it first hit the dealer.I\\'ve had no problems other than a couple factory recalls (and I never had a problem, but took it in anyway) and recently, a misfire in cyl 3 code which seems to pop up.New plugs and coils, so not sure what the issue is.I still get 32MPG on the highway, and yes, that is actual with cruise set @60MPH.I get my car serviced as required.I did have an issue with the front sunscreen.That is a cheap part they could have done better with.I just put 62k, and still going strong.It still has pep, and still looks brand new inside and out.Power when I need it....overall, the car has been great. Only one problem... My 2006 A 3 2.0 T the only problem (after four yrs.) are the sunshiled clips. I take the car to every service on the book. Does somebody knows where I can buy those clips (used) ? Just the clips. They cost around 90.00 each at the dealer & about 450.00 of labor.  What a dissapointment!! Have had this car for 5 years now and I\\'m completely dissapointed in the craftsmanship and performance of this car. So far I have had to replace: fuel pump, water pump and thermostat, air conditioner evaporator, left tail light bulb (about a dozen times) even though dealer swears there is nothing electrically wrong. Sun roof shade clips break just by looking at them. In addition, the paint on most of the dash board control buttons is flaking out and the paint in the pillars between the doors is about to fall off. Probably one of the worst cars I have ever owned. Good Service, Junk Car Owned certified pre-owned 2006 A3 for 2 months. Heres my timeline, you can be the judge.Week 1 - Heater Blower Motor Dies, Replacement is louder then stereo can goWeek 2 - Engine Misfires in Cylinders 3, Car in the shop for a week.Week 3 - Coolant not working AUX fan comes on to cool engine, caused by freezing coolant (improper mix)Week 4 - Engine Light Flashes, Misfire in 3 & 4, Car in shop for weekWeek 5 - Engine light solid coming off and onWeek 6 - Full Coolant Leak, caused by cracked housing from freezing. (another improper mix)Week 7 - Misfires between gear changes (2nd and 3rd gear)Week 8 - Engine Light Solid, returned car to dealership for FULL refund Great car let down by DSG I wanted a fun-to-drive car, with a bit more luxury. The A3, being based on the GTI, should be fun-to-drive, and come with nice Audi touches, so I thought this was the car for me. The Audi comfort touches are all there, but sadly, the fun-to-drive was not. The major problem is that in Drive mode, the DSG transmission like to conserve fuel, so it keeps rpm low (1500rpm). This means that when you need power, it takes a long second or two to kick down 2-3 gears to get going, which really really kills the fun-to-drive factor. On Sport mode, it\\'s nice and aggressive (never drops below 3000 rpm), but for daily driving, it\\'s a little too \"caffeinated.\" Great car when it runs Had A3 2.0T 6MT Sports package. Very fun to drive, but very unreliable. Over 4 and 1/2 years of owing it at 45000 miles, I had window sensor issues, hutch lock system replaced, ignition coil failed 3 times, cannot keep alignment more than 6 months, coolant start leaking, center console for rear broke off, temperature sensor failed. Dealer in MA will charge each inspection $110 even it is nothing more than error code download and same task. Start costing me a lot to own it. I finally got rid of it What a surprise! Just got this A3 with 55,000 on it. The interior did surprise me. Well made and very good design. Drove it and just after 5 minutes I knew this one was a keeper. Been in the car rental business for over 25 years, you get to know vehicles, and this one really won me over that fast. I hope that it will be as good on reliability. The  Europeans have it right, just the right size and no wasted of space. So much for German Engineering It seems that Germans have not discovered aluminum. All the interior design is in plastic with silly parts that break and are not covered by the warranty. Of course, the crooks from the dealer will charge $1000 for any stupid part and make you wait for a week to get it. I used the back seat arm rest once and it broke; I plugged an ipod in the cigarette lighter and it broke; the two moon light roof hatches broke; the bolt that holds the spare tire broke, etc. In addition, the car gets a check engine light every six months. As another reviewer noted, I had to change the Pirelli tires at 10k miles because they were really noisy. Finally, the dealers are pretty bad (but that\\'s another post) Love It! I love driving this car! It handles great around corners and has a nice tight suspension. The extra moon roof is a great addition. Not too happy with the cellphone charger application as it became out of date pretty fast but the bluetooth on the other hand was ahead of its time. Only at 38,000kms and pretty happy with it. I found when I put winter tires on it was really quite noisy in the car. So far the only issue I have had with it is my rear tail light keeps burning out and I am not sure why? I still need to take it in for some kind of recall with the gas cap issue. People actually stop me and ask me about this car, too bad they won\\'t be making it with the 3.2 anymore. Nearly 4 years in... ... and just passed 65,000 miles.  Still love driving the car.  Clutch still good.  So far, failures are: a/c compressor, turbo valve, psgr lock button and radiator gave way at 52,000 miles; the last one really got me bent \\'cause the car was just out of warranty.  Now have check engine light on, but car is running fine. Coded as fuel cap leak, so not worried.  Car is on third set of tires.  Original pirellis VERY noisy when worn, got zeons then yokahamas.  Zeons good but wore out in about 5 minutes, yokahamas are a good compromise.   Reliability is terrible I\\'ve had an Audi A3 2006 and it\\'s been nothing but trouble, with numerous repair visits to the dealer (covered by warranty until recently).  The problem areas have been the fuel injection system and various electronic components.  Just in the last 6 months, I\\'ve been to the dealer 7 times.  If you like to spend time in the waiting room of your dealership, this is the car for you.  Otherwise, there are much better (and cheaper) choices out there. A3 Tire noise I love the car, however, at 7500 miles I complained about tire noise. The dealer\\'s response was to replace the tires. I felt that this answer was inadequate. Am I supposed to replace my tires every 7500 miles? Audi obviously knows about the problem on the A3 but refuses to do anything about it. This has soured me on the car. I will never buy another Audi. Now I Get It! I needed a decent mileage, daily commuter that I could live with.  Looked at  domestic and Japanese offerings - settled on an 06\\' A3, 2.0T, DSG, 25,000 miles for $19k.  The hatch layout provides extra room when I need it.  This car is fun, fun, fun.  Don\\'t know how I ever lived without DSG trans.  My 1st Audi and handles awesome.  Had a 09\\' S4 convertible loaner during last service w/o DSG and couldn\\'t wait to get mine back.   Both front and back armrest latches have broken and there was a turbo problem - handled under warranty with loaner.  The little problems are worth the fun factor for me! Great car--lousy service This 06 A3 has been described to me as over engineered. When the car works well--95% of the time it is fantastic. When the a/c compressor went, it took 3 visits to the dealer with them telling that nothing was wrong, until I went crazy and an exec got into the car and told the service manager I was right. The radio switches stations on its own randomly--Audi says it\\'s my imagination and I should buy my own aftermarket replacement etc.....I really don\\'t know if the collection just has bad service or Audi USA is not consumer friendly --as they blame each other. 4 or 5 other thing have gone wrong over 21,000 miles.  Not horrible, but not top reliability. It\\'s a fight to get the dealer to fix it? Very VERY Disappointed I was excited to finally own an Audi.  At first the car was fun to drive then things started to go wrong at around 12,000 miles.  First the diaphragm for the turbo.  Then the DSM Transmission failed. Had to get towed. After my dealer rebuilt the transmission the car lurches into gear never a smooth take off.  Last week the entire cam shaft had to be replaced because the lobes on the shaft that drive the fuel pump worn completely through the follower and into the pump itself.  Check engine light comes on constantly.  Engine uses 1 quart of oil every 4,000 miles.  Sun roof cover has been broken 3 times since I got the car and now is fixed with a temporary paper clip.  Ugghhh! 2006 A3 2.0T Manuel Bought new, love this car. Had a VW Jetta 1.8 T, loved that also but this is much better. Great all season vehicle snow/rain no problem all season. Perelli P6 stick like glue and wear like iron. Just changed at 45K. Plenty of room for golf clubs and pull cart in rear without folding down rear seats. Vehicle has been very reliable. Handles like it\\'s on rails. Would definitely consider buying another next year!!! Dissapoinment The reliability has been terrible. Back in shop over and over again in the past six months. The warranty and the extended warranty has been useless. Always pondering what will break next. Not fun when you are driving a seven year old around. Never Again The 2.0 liter turbo jerks a lot and gas mileage is average.  Rides great on the highway but too \"loose\" in the city.  I have had several problems with my car and am just glad it is under warranty (though a new battery is not covered). My battery completely died after two years.  The clip for the sunshade on the Open Sky system broke (as is common) and was replaced by a non-matching black clip (interior is grey).  At 21,500 miles, my manual transmission broke where 1st gear and reverse did not work.  My car is currently in the shop (over one week now) and Audi is going to replace the transmission since they are afraid the problem could spread to the other gears if they rebuild it.   Amazing Car for the Money This car has been a very nice vehicle to own. It has been to Northern Michigan during the winter ( ESP worked very well )and the summer  A/C worked very well . Average mileage winter/ summer is about 23 mpg city and about 28 / 29 highway. In the winter we have seen 32 mpg on a round trip to Atlanta and on a trip to North Carolina we saw about 28 . Very comfortable on a long trip. In town as an errand vehicle the car has been very handy.  Parking is a breeze and even in summer with the AC running ( as in right now ) we get about 21 in town  day to day stop and go. The warranty on the 2006 was handy with the sunshade and the AC needing repair as well as the oil change and service intervals.  Love the Car I\\'ve had the car for two years. It\\'s a lot of fun to drive, and gets decent mileage (~27mpg). The interior is perfect for my needs, and the hatchback is highly functional. There\\'s been some wear and tear. A lost button, and a busted door handle. Given I paid $26k for the car, I consider it an outstanding value. What a Gem I traded in my 2003 530i for a certified pre-owned A3 with 36,275 miles on it. I couldn\\'t be happier. It is a phenomenal vehicle, and all for under 30k. It all starts with the engine. The 2.0T is a great powerplant, and I love the short throws on my 6 speed manual transmission. The low end torque really gets the car going. The steering is very responsive and the ride is very stable. It is such a blast to drive. It is a coin flip between this A3 and a 323i as the best driving cars I have ever owned.  The quality of the interior build is much better than the BMWs I have just come out of (a 323i then 530i). The fuel economy is not bad (25mpg for me) for such a fun car to drive Looking good, but many major problems We leased the car in October. By July AC broke down in 90 degree heat and 100% humidity. Audi couldn\\'t fix the problem for a month. They had to replace the compressor twice. Then a year later I fule pump broke down on a highway and the car almost stalled. I barely avoided the accident. Now my just simply wouldn\\'t start one day. When mechanic from Audi came - the and tried to start it - the engine started smoking. Week later they tell me oil pump is broken and they are replacing the engine.  I am getting rid of the car - I no longer feel safe driving with kids in it. Total dissapointment. Great Car I bought this car just under 3 years ago. My lease is almost up, and I am going to buy it. The car looks great, drives great, fast for what it is, good fuel efficiency, nice options, DSG is great, and reliability is very good.  There are only two issues with this car. Considering the performance, the springs should be a little harder, I replaced them and I am very happy now.  The other issue. Mankind has been building cars since 1908, you think by now we could wash the engine with a hose pipe and not damage the engine. Well maybe I am wrong, so I did, and it cost me $180. Do not wash the engine with water. Otherwise really a great car.  Driving experience Really fun to drive, excellent comfort and the sound of the powertrain is pleasing.   Mighty Little Hatchback I recently purchased an A3, 2.0T with the intention of having a daily driver that offered economy as well as reliability.  My immediate impression once I climbed into the well fitted interior was that this was a driver\\'s cockpit.  As I pressed the little vehicle I soon lost sight of the mundane purpose and started focusing on how incredibly fun this car was to drive.  I must confess with a stable of alternatives I often find myself firing up the little Hatchback as a prefered choice.  Imagine that!  This vehicle hits the bullseye like Willy Tell.  Compare this vehicle to anything available in this meager price range and you would be hard pressed to find such a tightly wound package.   Saved My Life My wife and I had this car for over a year and simply loved it. Had some build quality problems. The rear window had to be replaced because of noise in the radio caused by the rear defroster being on. Also had to have a relay replaced since the car would not go above 30! Aside from that drove it across country and it was great and lots and lots of fun.    We just got in a serious accident in it and walked away with only minor injuries from the airbag propellant. This car might have saved our lives. It certainly let us just walk away from a bad accident. I would most definitely get another, but next time I want AWD. VERY VERY SAFE! Pretty to look at, but don\\'t buy it! Great car, but not a month goes by without the check engine light coming on.  2 air conditioning compressors, misfiring cylinders, won\\'t eject CDs, 1 qt of oil every 4K miles, 2 coolant leaks, leaking turbo inlet and seals, and on and on...   I will NEVER buy another Audi, what a giant let down! Solid as a Rock Outfitted the A3 3.2 with a Miltek Catback Exhaust and a K&N Air filter to let the car breathe easier and help with gas mileage. However the utterly cool throaty exhaust note before now has the wow factor to compliment everything else on this ride. Got everything except nav and Bluetooth; the car is a pleasure to tool around in with precise handling, brakes, low road-noise and comfortable seating. The Bose system kicks and I absolutely love the Xenon Directional Headlights. My car geek friends are constantly amazed by the DSG transmission and how settled the car is at even 120+. Had the opportunity to drive the car in a recent torrential downpour and the Quattro was just amazing. 2006 California A3-DSG-2.0T This Audi replaces my previous 2002 GTI 337 edition, and it is noticably refined even better than the 06 GTi which can be optioned to cost as much as an \\'06 A3. Prices for these cars [mine bought w/5K miles on odo] have a large range of prices.  As a CertUsed purchase you can get upto 6years/60Kmiles on overall Audi warranty.  More comfortable and vuality ride than anything previous.  Slightly more body roll than I am used to, but it never pretended to be a sports car.  Throttle response is good but occasionally confused with DSG happenings.  Interior and creature comforts is where ths vehicle shows head & shoulders above the Mazdaspeed3 and WRX-Saab 9-2.  Getting used to the DSG takes time. Pretty good, but... Great purchase, in general. You wouldn\\'t expect a 4-door hatch to be a head turner, but it is.  The famous Audi attention to detail is there, but I take issues with some of the UI decisions.  Maybe it\\'s just mine, but the DSG is a little hinky and pauses and catches sometimes (dealer told me they couldn\\'t find any problems when I took it in).  Sunroof clip broke the very first day.  No iPod jack on an upgraded Bose system? Come on. No OB computer?? Even my girlfriend\\'s Grand Vitara shows real-time gas mileage. Great Vehicle has been great!  Engine has excellent acceleration with 250 horses and automatic transmission shifts almost like a manual.  I have 18\" rims and my windows tinted and it has been a head turner.  Great for younger people, if they can afford it.  Only dislike is the size.  I need more room in the back, but then I\\'d have to go on to an A4 right?  Better gas mileage also. A3 is a great car! The A3 is a cross between the TT and A4 Avant. The 2-liter turbo scoots, car handles well and the wagon design is practical. Interior design is a beauty, with brushed aluminum trim included with the premium group.  And you don\\'t see A3s coming and going all the time on the roads. It\\'s almost a well-kept secret. Safe well built car I got my Audi A3 sport back 3.2 quattro and think its a great car with loads of space. I just picked up a freezer easily. It went in back with two seats down and room for my mum in back seat. Build is perfect, safe and the quattro makes wet or snow weather easy to drive in. Petrol isn\\'t too bad - 32 mpg on motorway doing 70mph and round town 23mpg. The dsg box is great, won\\'t go back to manual now . It\\'s fast, 3.2 sport and driving on long journeys is great. Hardly any wind noise or road noise which you would expect having quattro.  Well Rounded Car The best all around car you can buy. This car is a special car, I\\'ve driven an M5 and this car is more fun to drive. Don\\'t let the size of car fool you - the exterior is small and fun to parallel park in downtown, but the interior is spacious. The stability control works extremely well in snow or rain. I have gotten over 500 miles on a full tank of gas that is only 14.5 gallons big, driving from S.F to Seattle.  2006 A3 3.2Q A great car to drive, performance with the 3.2 is smooth and very fast, handling is excellent. Especially like Quattro, no torque steer or wheel hop even under very hard accelleration. The interior is exceptional and the fit and finish are perfect. For the price I would have liked a power passenger seat and rear heated seats, but that is pretty minor stuff. Finished in bright red with 18\" wheels it attracts a lot of attention.  Upgrade I drove a Ford Ranger before this car, obviously it\\'s a huge change and upgrade. Still, having driven a standard for the last 25 years, I didn\\'t like the auto transmission for the first 5000 miles, but once it was broken in, it\\'s been a dream since. Cost was fair value; I don\\'t think it is overpriced at all even with the luxury package and Open Sky.   One of the Best Choices Under 30K I\\'ve been driving my A3 for a little over a year.  The handling is amazing with the sport package.  DSG is cool for lazy feet, but not for me.  Bottom line: there are a lot of cars out there in this price range.  More importantly, there are many above this price range.  A GIAC or REVO for this car, and it will hang with the M3s and STIs of the world.  However, with the A3 you also get practicality and comfort, which those cars do not have. AND, I\\'m getting 36 MPG highway! FUN TO DRIVE My A3 is an excellent ride. I drive 60 miles to work one way and it is all freeway. The vehicle handles and performs well. I feel safe on the road. I have averaged 32 mpg on the highway. The car is responsive and when the turbo kicks in I can easily move through traffic. The hand brake could be in a better position. The car should have a compass. Get the deluxe package and 17\" wheels.  Very Fun Car, Worth Every Penny!!! Since I knew for a while that I was going to drive from PA to FL \\x96 1,180 miles \\x96 I waited to write this review. I have a 2.0T, DSG, Sport Package, 17\\x92 wheels, and the car is AWESOME. Honestly, it could not be better! The engine is very responsive, transmission is smooth and fun to use on all three modes (Sport, Drive, and Shift Pads), interior finishing is upper class, audio system is excellent, and the exterior looks from every angle very sporty. I had never had a car with sport suspension and was afraid that I would get tired of the firm ride. When I test-drove the A3 premium package and the sport package prior to make my decision, I had no doubt that the sport package was the way to go! Green Sports Car This car is awesome!! For one thing this is not a dime a dozen car. I love that not every car in the parking lot is an A3. I always get 28-30 miles to the gallon highway and almost the same in the city. What other car can zip you around town take corners fast and get good gas. I got open sky it great is makes the car feel roomier. The DSG is fun when your driving just for the hell of it. Plus you can feel you are in a well bulit car. My doors are way heavier (3 steel beams per door vs. 2) than an american counterpart. Upgraded from 01 GTI Upgrading from the GTI, the Audi feels very familiar.  The 6MT is silky smooth, and feels even better than the GTI (awesome feel). I have the lux.pkg., sunroof, coldweather. I am a bit worried about snow and the 17\" tires. In researching, I was wanting the 4-door GTI (not avail as of yet) or A3. My 3 main gripes: sunroof in my GTI was superior (1-touch/better sunshade). The basic radio is NOT mp3 compatible and aux input not standard. The climate controls are NOT intuitive (but make sense after studying the manual). It\\'s a great auto, don\\'t get me wrong. The road feel, engine note, steering wheel feel, interior look/design, it just feels right. Oh, my insurance increased only ~$60/year over my GTI. New Audi A3... Loving It! I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever written a review before, but I had to let you all know I love my new Audi A3. It is so much fun to drive. The gas mileage is what it says on the sticker. It handles beautifully and turns on a dime. It is not for really tall people. My uncle got in front (he is probably 6\\'3\") and almost had to open the sunroof for extra room. I am 5\\'8\" and fit very comfortably. I love the bluetooth capability. That is awesome for talking on the phone, especially since mine is a standard. The only improvement... the voice recognition could be improved. I\\'ll say the number and it will repeat it wrong. Sometimes it is better to just dial manually and then talk using the car speaker. Those who \"get it\" love it. Best car I have ever owned, period. The A3 is one of the best cars on the road and yet you will be hard pressed to find one next to you at the stop light. Most  will not understand this car and just write it off as a \"wagon\" but the people who \"get it\" drool over it when they see it. I have enjoyed driving this car so much that I often go for drives just to enjoy it. I bought my 2.0T before the 3.2 was available. I have not driven the 3.2 for fear of wanting to upgrade. The power is more than sufficient in the 2.0. I got almost every option on the car except Nav which does send the price way up but its still a great car and a good value. 3 months & 10000 miles later! I\\'ve only had this vehicle 3 mos. but have managed to put it through its paces around so. cal. The car is everything I expected it to be. Practical, sexy, fun to drive. No cost maintenance has saved me a lot. The DSG is smooth and effortless, yet aggressive. The new 2.0 FSI engine is awesome. Even grandma would feel like Schumacher behind the wheel. Props to Audi for making an affordable, luxury, performance, \"hatchback\"! Fun to drive but glad I leased it I\\'ve had this car 9 months and have put over 10k miles on. A lot of fun to drive, and good looking, too. But I\\'m glad I didn\\'t buy it. It\\'s chock full of little annoyances. Sticky turn signal, huge gap between 4th and 3rd gears on downshift, sunroof with a mind of its own, bits and pieces constantly loosening or falling off, too easy to knock gear shift out of manual when upshifting, to name a few. And it\\'s a rattle-trap. Very good mileage considering the turbo engine, though. Couldn\\'t ask for anything more Being that my father used to work at the Audi plant in Stuttgart many, many years ago, I know of the German reputation for building quality cars.  I have not been disappointed.  The single most thing that stands out for me is the performance.  I have been thrown back into my seat on several occassions when stepping on the gas.  The interior is impeccable along with the skyroof and especially the onboard computer.  I no longer have to use a calculator to figure out my gas mileage.  The comfort and functionality of the seats are first rate.  My last four cars were all Ford models.  This is my first Audi.  If the A3 is any indication, this definitely wont be the last Fun drive Car is fun to drive.  The turbo engine needs a slight more power, nothing a chip upgrade won\\'t fix.  Front wheels due seem to spin a bit, but after some driving time you learn how to minimize the spin. Mature and Sporty I chose the A3 because I was looking for a car that was mature (not a boy toy), functional (can I fit a large screen TV ?), and sporty (fun to drive). The A3 is a perfect match. The DSG is fantastic - but took some getting used to as I would tend to forget I was in manual mode. My only regret was not getting the Sport model, because the suspension is a little softer than what I am used to, but then the ride is more luxurious as well, and I did ask for a mature ride. I\\'m getting about 22 MPG in mixed driving, but think I\\'d do better if I quit playing with the paddles. At first I didn\\'t think I\\'d want the Open Sky roof, but now I am very happy I got it.  A3 2.0 Turbo After 10,000 miles I bought this car last October after gas hit $3/gal (the first time) and after test driving the others. I have owned many luxury and sporty cars over the years from the BMW 7 and Mercedes S sedans to the BMW M3. I have to say that this car is a perfect blend of fun, function and economy. The DSG transmission is fantastic, the hatchback with fold-down seats plenty roomy, and the gas mileage (~28 mpg) is great for today\\'s environment.  We just turned over 10K miles and have had no problems with the car at all!  My only complaint is the Pirelli tires -- too much road noise. I plan to own this car  for a long time! Congratulations to Audi. agility and speed Overall an exciting car to drive. I\\'m able to navigate busy DC with little problem, and the DSG TRANNY IS KICKIN. The only complaint I have is the driver seat seems to be losing its support. Seats started out firm, but now they are uncomfortable. Limited thigh support for my 6\\'1\" frame. Sunroof is a blast. Wanted all-wheel, but didn\\'t want the 6 cylinder. Overall a kickin car to drive. Great car to own and drive. I have nearly 5000 miles in three months and the driving has been great.  I have the Sport package and love the aluminum trim. The car has a quality feel and the engine is great.  It is easy to zip up to 80 miles an hour without realizing it. Highway mileage is 27-32 which is a plus. I have the navigation system with Bose stereo - fabulous.  I am glad I bought this car and plan to enjoy it for many years. It is a fun car to drive. all of these reviews are dead on It\\'s incredibly fun to drive. Fast, fast, fast. And agile! I wouldn\\'t bother with a MT  b/c the DSG lives up to the hype - definitely get it without the sport package because the paddles are a blast. The 2.0 is doing 80 before you realize, so the 3.2 must be incredible. When you fold down the back seats there is plenty of room. Definitely test before considering any comparable vehicles.  Lovin\\' It! We\\'re a growing family, had to find a car to replace my old 2 seat Honda del Sol SI.  We\\'re a Honda family, and I had my heart set on an \\'06 Civic SI.  But I just couldn\\'t get excited about it after driving.  Drove 8 cars back-to- back-- Honda, Volvo, Mercedes, Lexus, Acura, even a Prius, and in the $30k range, the A3 was BY FAR the most spirited drive out there.  It\\'s a German car and has it\\'s quirks, but for a $5k premium over the Civic SI (with options), this is a *lot* more vehicle.  Not too many of them on the road either, and it definitely gets attention.  White exterior with Black Open sky roof / Black interior gives a sharp contrast aka some of the Mini\\'s.... One year later, still going strong I did an Edmunds review on this car, a year ago when I bought it, and I am still very happy. It is reliable, fast, very useful due to its hatch and folding seats and very comfortable and fun to drive. I added 245 size tires which give the car better traction and handling, but do scrape a little at the back, but well worth it. Currently my mileage is 7700 miles (hard driving), and the car was bought in CA, USA. I still think the car is an excellent buy, but time will tell.  like driving a humming bird I haven\\'t found a single design flaw on this car. Everything is perfect. Quality is typical Audi  (i.e., very good) but the dash has a somewhat plasticky look (a different rubberized surface would have a nicer look, I think). Also, I\\'m not a big fan of the aluminum trim on the sport model.  That said, this car is an amazing drive. Powerful, fast, almost no turbo lag. No one has outmuscled it on the freeway yet.   All Fun All the Time The A3 is great fun to drive. The 2.0 turbo engine is fantastic. More fun than my old supercharged Mercedes. I\\'ve always liked to do my own shifting and have had manual transmissions. When I drove the DRG automatic I was won over. I can\\'t imagine going back after after driving this quick smooth automatic, or electronic manual as Audi refers to it. I haven\\'t had any problems with my Audi. It\\'s always a joy to get in and drive.  Weeeehooooooo!!! Nothing compares to my A3! What a personality it has!!! It\\'s sexy looking, quick and heaps of fun to drive. There are not many on the road and people constantly stop and ask about the car... WARNING: Watch the pedal because you will be doing 85pmh and not even realize it... :) Great Car! I was looking for a car good for a small family, 25+mpg, and fun to drive.  The A3 is a perfect fit. I\\'ve only had it for 250 miles but completely love it so far.  It was tough to get the exact one I wanted and had to include XM radio. This is my first Audi and was nervous about going non-Japanese, but it felt so great to drive.  MPGs are not quite what they say.  I have the black leather interior and everyone comments on how great it looks.  Also seen comments about the sunroof letting light in when closed but the glass is really tinted so I haven\\'t noticed much heating effect.  I think the ventilation system is also really great and intuitive vs other cars. Audi All the Way!! Researched the car for over a year and finally test drove an A3 among other brands:  BMW, Volvo, and Acura.  A3 won me over mainly for its fuel economy and the performance - TURBO.  A very capable \"sportswagon\".  Most of my friends couldn\\'t believe how well handled the car is on the road - mine comes with the sports option.  The AudiConcert sound system is quite good.  I can\\'t wait to take this car along the Coastal Hi-Way in Calif.  Nice work, Audi! All-Time Favorite A terrific vehicle overall. Fast, fun, with practical features. Beautiful interior and exterior design elements. 2.0T engine a driver\\'s delight. Audi Concert audio very capable. Ride, handling, comfort, and thoughtful touches allow all-day comfort and fun in the twisties. This car makes me smile during and after every drive. Premium and Cold Weather pkgs. nice.  \"Sportswagon\" more apt than \"hatchback.\" The A3 \"concept\" and execution is dead-on. I\\'m 6\\' and OK in the back seat without Open Sky. Solid feel. Looks small, but really isn\\'t. I love this car. The center arm rest can interfere with the hand brake, but it\\'s no big deal. Options can add-up to 30+k. Form follows function. FUN!! What a dandy little car. 2.0L with DSG tranny makes for a potent powerplant in this sports wagon(?). Much versatility, fuel efficient, comfortable, agile... just a blast to drive. Get one, if it has enough room for how you intend to use it. An overlooked vehicle Having owned an A4 1.8T previously, I\\'ve had first hand experience with the Audi product. The 2.0T is a huge improvement over the already great 1.8T and the DSG transmission is a blast to drive. The tight handling and fun to drive factor have made me forget about many of the luxury items I became used to in the A4, including Quattro. My A3 is the best car I\\'ve ever owned. My first car ... It\\'s my first new car. Premier package with Opensky. I am driving a car again after two and half years break and am still getting used to it. Mileage is as expected. Acceleration and handling feel great but sometimes it doesn\\'t seem to respond as well to gas pedal. I don\\'t know if it is my driving. The front sunshade latch on the Opensky broke after 5-6 times of use. The dealership admitted that they have been getting lot of complaints about that latch. The screws attached to the net/hook in the cargo area are really loose. I also occasionally hear some rattles from behind. It is the first production apparently. Otherwise, the storage space seems to justify why I preferred this to A4 sedan.  Feel of luxury for a great price Never thought I would own a brand new Audi, but from the minute I saw this car I new I had to have it! The price with some luxury options was reasonable considering the happiness I feel driving it. The paddles are fun, the seats are comfy, the open sky is beautiful and it is so peppy..getting by the trucks on the highway is a breeze. Had some minor problem with the keys bu the dealer to care of it. Have 15000 miles on it already and the car is running beautifully. Best bet for an entry luxury car...has the look of it\\'s higher priced brothers and sisters and a top notch engine and interior design. Fast, but Open-Sky is cheap quality Initially happy with the power and interior quality. A little turbo lag, especially in 1st gear. Quattro should be available with the manual transmission. I had to go for front-wheel drive to get M.T. which feels inferior to rear-drive cars like 325ci. Car is fast and nimble, but nowhere near that of the 3-series (2003 for comparison). The interior sunshade for Open-Sky system is cheap looking and feeling. The latches are breaking (common problem). This is an Audi luxury brand car and should not have such cheap parts. The rest of the interior is of good quality and presentation, though. Stylish and peppy car that stands out! My requirements for a car are always can I fit my 3 dogs?  Is it AWD?  Is it comfortable on long trips (I pack about 30,000 miles a year on a car....)  Does the sound system actually SOUND GOOD?  Finally IS IT FAST AND FUN TO DRIVE... The answer to all these are YES!  If you need a car that can haul stuff, is sporty, and quick while safe in snow this baby is it!  If you have a heavy foot gas mileage won\\'t be as good as you think but MUCH better than my previous SUV.  This car allowed me to be practical yet maintain my need for fun, speed, cool gadgets and nice rims all wrapped up neatly in AWD so I can get around on the back roads of NY in the winter. Looks like a Wagon, but.... I wasn\\'t so sure about this car, but my fiance insisted that it is/was the best value on the road.  We test drove it in Washington DC and bought it in Honolulu, HI.  This car is incredible.  It\\'s fun to drive, has a definite wow factor, roomy, etc.  We haven\\'t had anything go wrong, but I have been tough on the wheels!  I take corners fast and I love the feel of the car as it pulls through every turn.  I have surprised numerous drivers on the road since many assume this car is just a wagon, but once I hit the gas petal, the A3 accelerates past pretty much anything out there. Best car I have owned! I have always wanted to own an Audi and now I know why! This is truly a great car - comfortable, reliable and fun to drive. Living on an island I cannot enjoy it to the max, but still appreciate everything about it. A few weeks ago, the car\\'s brakes and handling saved my life - another car turned directly in front of me, I hit the brakes (no locking) and once I had slowed down, I touched the steering wheel to the right and got around the other vehicle - if I were in most other cars, I probably would not be writing this now! Solid Coming down from driving 96 A6, this car gives me so much joy and fun for daily commute of 30 miles on busy freeway 10 in LA.  I had such a fun driving A6 qattro for 5 years especially when I was in NY but this little brother is suprisingly solid for the price I paid for.  I am sure  it\\'s not a very difficult choice for most of folks who test drive this car to agree with me about this car but driving longer period of time just confirmed my decision further more.  Drive it and enjoy your life and be a happy driver with this solid A3 Test drove it then..... had to have it!!  I bought the last one on the lot, a red base 2.0 with a six speed m.t.  This car is a blast....has a bottomless well of torque and a (very subjective) perfect balance between ride and handling.  Transmission is positive and quick.  The motor is a gem - NO turbo lag and just a sly hint of that distinctive suck/whine that blown engines have.  I love this thing.   Very Sweet Ride!!! I drove a lot of cars, some much more expensive, before buying the A3 and I couldn\\'t be happier.   The build quality, ride, handling, and power development in this car is excellent, especially at the price paid.   The technology with the FSI engine is class-leading which includes a factory front mounted intercooler and forged engine components that should last a long time.   The fuel mileage started off only fair at a mixed 20mpg, but over the first 3k miles improved to 25mpg.   I attribute the slightly lower mileage to my heavy foot and the car\\'s speed inspiring exhaust notes.   An ECU chip brings this engine to max performance with 240+hp & 275+torque, a true monster! My best car ever Fun to drive specially on my everyday route going to work, it\\'s a long very winding road. Great performance for a small car. It looks very deceiving because it\\'s a small car anf a station wagon look. But man.... they are wrong to pick this car for a race. This car has a lot of power on it.  2 Thumbs up from a car guy I am an automotive engineer with a large transplant company from Japan...this was my 1st German car. I am very impressed! Interior/exterior fit/finish is Japanese quality, material quality is tops, handling is extremely good (I got the sport suspension-a little harsh, excuse me, good road input, but that\\'s the way car guys like it!), acceleration is a blast! On 2 lane back roads, down shift, tag the gas and you\\'re by grandma and the semi in a wink of the eye! No turbo lag and terrific fuel economy. Who could ask for anything more? Well, my guests said they could use more rear seat leg room-I think I\\'ll leave them at home next time. This is not your wife\\'s soccer wagon! Probably the World\\'s Best Luxury Hatch I bought the A3 as a \"spare\" car alongside an S4 Cabriolet, and couldn\\'t be happier. I suddenly find myself letting the wife drive the convertible so I can get a zippy little hatch for the city! Gorgeous inside and out, responsive, mileage almost as good as my son\\'s Civic coupe, great handling, that transmission. Quattro BLAST! This car is a 4wheel Quattro BLAST! I considered the Subaru WRX as another fast mini-wagon, but after comparing the 2, the Audi made the Subaru seem cheap and tinny. The DSG (direct shift gearbox) is amazingly smooth and snappy as any manual transmission shifter can do on their own. Very nice sportwagon The engine/drivetrain combination on the A3 is amazingly wonderful. 200 hp on tap with superfast and supersmooth DSG. The style is subtle and sublime. The interior is impeccably Audiesque. The Truth, a REVIEW you need to READ Less than 1yr old. I\\'ve ran into every problem imagineable. Let me list all the problems i\\'ve had: 1) Locking mechanism: rear locks stopped locking, dont know how or what I did to them (maybe nothing?). 2) Alarm engaging: days later, alarm stopped. Service guy told me to manually lock (you do not pay for a pseudo luxury car to manually lock your car). 3) Moon roof malfunction: the mesh screen would get stuck, I took it back 3 times. 3rd time due to me running over a curb cuz I was pulling so hard. 4)Sun visor & tail light: went out in 6 months. 5) foglight grill: flew off on freeway. $100 something to replace. 6) airbag malfunction. 7) speakers: front ones went out, they said it was my fault for loose wire. DSG Transmission Problems Car was great until around 7300 miles; then I heard a noise that sounded like an aircraft turbine engine. Took it to the dealer, who determined it was the transmission, but said they would have to notify Audi to determine what work could be done. Took Audi 6 days to decide to replace the transmission, which had to be shipped from Germany. It appears that if the dealer hadn\\'t contacted Audi to pressure them to make a decision, Audi would still be deciding what action, if any, they were going to take. So, 2 weeks after problem surfaced I finally got the car back. Now I\\'m concerned about the reliability of the DSG transmission. Didn\\'t get any help from Audi Customer Relations Advocate either! Love Hate relationship The car is absolutely amazing. For an all around do it all vehicle Audi hit the nail on the head. I love the design and the interior layout. I love the sportiness of the suspension and how the car handles every type of road thrown at it. I hate that I have taken the car in for two electrical problems already. First, was the coolant temperature sensor crapped out on me. Audi did order the part and had it in within a week though. Secondly my heated seats went out and come to find out it was just a plug issue. The 2.0T is capable, but needs more. A $600 chip increases to 250 HP and 300 lbs of torque. Cargo could be a little better, but any more and it would be an SUV. Overall it is a great car! The best of two worlds I traded in a 2004 TT (3.2, quattro with DSG) for the  A3 3.2 quattro in order to get a back seat.  I thought I\\'d miss the TT but I don\\'t. The A3 combines the performance of the TT (same engine same DSG) with the comfort of a five (well, really four) passenger car.  It\\'s lightening fast and the DSG offers even smoother shifts than on the TT.  The styling outside and in is great, with elements of the TT and the A4. The new grill looks great on this model.  Equipped with the bi-xenon headlights, navigation system (an MMI interface that becomes the command center for radio, CDs, telephone, navigation, etc.), open sky system and Bluetooth, it has it all.   No Regrets Pros: Excellent entry level luxury car. Lots of options available. The build quality is excellent inside and out (except for the sunshade - see below) and the car feels very solid and stable on the road. Plenty of power in the 2.0T model. Cons: Power driver seat only available on cars with Premium package (most dealerships carry the Sport package). No power passenger seat available. The latch on the sunshade for the Open Sky system broke within a week (Audi is supposedly releasing a kit to their service centers to fix this flimsy part). I\\'m converting to Audi for life! This is my first Audi, and I couldn\\'t be happier.  The acceleration is amazing (0-60 faster than the Boxster), and the handling is crisp and responsive.  The DSG is an engineering marvel as well. This car has opened my eyes to the beauty of Audi, and I will be an Audi loyalist from here on out.  This car serves as my daily commuter as well as my weekend joyrider and it fills both roles admirably.  The sport program on the automatic is also tons of fun, and useful for showing up coffee can exhaust bumble bees that meet you at red lights... Worth the wait! I had been looking to replace my VW Passat for the past year. The new Passats left me cold, I was waiting for the new GTI but after comparing the two and driving the A3 I had to have the Audi. Had mine special ordered as black, silver & grey are the only colors dealers seem to be stocking in the Northeast. I had mine done in white and it really stands out and shows off the cars lines. Great driving, awesome performance (zero turbo lag) and superb roadholding. Will dust many more expensive cars. Front seats very comfortable and sound system rocks. 4DR TT I purchased my A3 w/sport, convenience, cold weather, Bose, Open Sky and Xenon in Jan.  CPO vehicle with 4,000 miles so I got the 6 yr/100k warrantee. I know who the previous owner was.  Traded my 00 VR6 VW Jetta.  I loved my VW but this car is it.  The looks and build quality are top notch.  Performance for a 4 cyl Turbo is fantastic.  This thing goes.  The exhaust note when on the gas is music to my ears.  Just loud enough to let you know that this baby has a little something under the hood.  Xenon lights are great, Bose is plenty fine, I am not an audiophile and my girls really like the glass over the rear seats.  Ergonomics are just right inside. Just a solid package for around 30K.  The best kept secret When you get behind the wheel of an A3 the first thing you notice is the attention to detail in the form and the lines, the ergonomics are great. Second, the driving experience is like no other due to the super speed in which the gears are changed by the automatic transmission. There is almost no turbo lag, and the handling is secure at all times. Lastly, the sporty look of this vehicle and how many people stare this little aggresive car might actually change the view that wagons are boring. Why I know that, because I used to think that too, not anymore thanks to the A3. One great car After a one-year search for a car that could make me happy without spending 50K the Audi A3 has achieved that feat. I love the design and hatchback flexibility, and solid interior ergonomics (the seats are awesome). The drive is pure bliss: Great acceleration, fun manual shifter and pretty low interior noise. Steering is precise, low body-roll. As mentioned below, some improvements can be done, of which the most important ones are the handbrake and climate control issues. If you are looking for a hatchback at an entry-luxury level, there is nothing better out there than the A3 (BMW 1 series and Mercedes A class need not apply). Great Performance and Value After owning three BMWs I thought it was time for a change. The press reviews of the A3 2.0T lulled me into an Audi dealership and within an hour it became a no-brainer: BMW-like performance and quality for under 30k. I\\'m in. Go easy on the options (I went for the Premium Package, standard, no sun roof) and enjoy the ride. Its not quite the \"riding on rails\" handling of my 2000 323ci, but its faster. Really! And 10k cheaper.  Fun2Drive The first thing I noticed about this car was its solidity. Closing the trunk yields a solid thump. The entire chassis feels like it was carved from one piece of metal. The second thing I noticed was the steering. Much lighter than the 3 series, but still providing a lot of road feel and sporty playfullness. This steering really begs the driver to toss the car around. Ditto for the engine, though I haven\\'t fully pushed it yet-still breaking in. One thing I love is the low-end torque. You can really thrash the car around and keep it under 3000 rpm. The interior is beautiful-love the amber lighting, but I have one gripe-the stereo (both bose and std) sounds muffled-get new speakers/amp. A sports car without the pain Manual, Premium package (much better seats), xenon lights, Bose sound (big improvement), Sirius, Bluetooth etc. Replaced the crap stock P6\\x92s with much better tires. This car grows on you. The longer you own it, the more you realize how good it is: great steering and handling, big broad power band, beautifully built, so smooth, surprisingly quiet. 5K miles so far: NOTHING has gone wrong -- not a rattle, not a screw loose. We have been very surprised at how good a high speed (85 mph) long distance cruiser it is. Amazing stability. Immune to gusty winds. Very comfortable. Surprising amount of room and trunk space. We prefer it to our previous larger, more expensive cars. A3 DSG premium sound sat. I have had the car 3 weeks. So much fun to drive. Shifting the car with the paddles rocks, normally I just up shift and let it down shift for me. It works great.  Great car highly recommended.   Audi A3 DSG I planned to buy this car and I test drove it, its the best transmission I ever experience, no matter up-shift or down-shift, its so smooth and I think I will make the right choice.  Engine response is very good, I drove 2 turbos before and this one is a new experience since I don\\'t need to use gas pedal and clutch to minimize the turbo lags.  Thanks to DSG, and its only offer in A3s or TTs, don\\'t get the manual, get DSG, its the best tranny so far in the market! (and its easily to get the engine improve to 250 horses and matching the V6 power - except the quattro unless you think its a must!) Was Skeptical but now a Fan Wanted to get rid of my SUV while I still could.  Heard about A3, drove it and it\\'s quite a car.  Try going out on the highway and letting it fly - no other experience like it.  Excellent Sporty Choice If you\\'re looking at the Volkswagen or the WRX, take a look at the Audi. The DSG is a blast to drive, with the paddle shifting responding quickly.  Comfort is sweet in the front, almost like sitting on cardboard boxes in the back, not good. Wish I had never bought an A4 Unfortunately, I bought a 2010 A4 CVT (no CVT for me anymore).I was so dissatisfied with the car we traded it with just under 1000 miles for a Jetta Wolfsburg turbo. A little over a year later, the VW was traded for a CRV and we bought an A3 outright.It was a bit of a gamble - driving to Atlanta from Orlando to pick it up - but well worth the journey. We bought it certified with 4K miles and turned around and drove it home. A little fatigued we didn\\'t fully appreciate the long trip (and the road noise is a little, I stress little, much) but now that we\\'re back home we\\'re tickled.The manual is responsive, the steering firm, the look is mature but not pretentious. This is a driver\\'s car!! Just what I needed I just bought the car a few weeks ago. I got the Premium Plus with convenience, titanium, and open sky packages. The car rides amazingly smooth. Love the responsiveness. I was between the Audi A3 and BMW 328i wagon. The A3 is the right size, gets great gas mileage and its just a great car. I also got an amazing deal on the car (below invoice pricing). I left behind a 2010 Honda Accord which lacked performance and guzzled gas like nothing. I plan to have this car for years to come. I\\'m new to the Audi family so I still have some tricks to learn but for a 4-cyl twin-turbo I have to say I\\'m impressed. The car is very easy to use; there is no complicated guessing or confusing buttons. Very nice. So far so good I was cross shopping the A3 with a GTI with sunroof and Nav.  The cars are similar on paper (engine etc.) but have a very different personality to drive.  The A3 is more refined and feels lighter to drive. I like the lower roofline of the Audi.  The extra sound insulation helps too.  GTI is a better value for bang for the buck but the Audi feels more polished. I got the A3 with Premium Plus and Titanium Sport.  The PP is a must for the xenons and LED DRLs.  The Ti sport interior is fantastic and the ride height is perfect in my opinion. The one feature that annoys me is the inability to scroll through the presets using the controls on the MFSW.   PURCHASED BECAUSE OF IIHS TOP SAFETY PICK Will never purchase another VW, Audi or VAG product again. Total inaction after years of waiting on the Takata airbag recall. TDI BuyBack is beyond tedious, waiting over 6 months for an offer letter. A3 TDI review - Edmonds doesn\\'t offer option What a disappointment! OK for 21/2 years 15K miles, then problems began. 18 months of a slow coolant leak which dealer could not find. Had to keep a gallon of coolant with me at all times. Finally, after warranty expired, the dealer replaced the water pump to cure the problem. Wanted to charge me for it. After pointing out that it had been in three times over the past 18 months, they decided it was under warranty. Now with 55K miles, the waste gate regulation valve on the turbo has failed, along with a pressure line to the turbo (I previously owned a Jetta TDI, given to my son, whose turbo failed at 46K miles - this failure occurred after I had bought the Audi). So far, up to about $1500 in repairs on a car with has lost 20% of its value due to the emissions shenanigans. I am waiting to see if Audi will offer to buy it back. A recent court settlement calls for them to buy back the older TDI\\'s on the road and \"repair\" (read destroy the good mileage) the newer ones. Needless to say, THIS IS MY LAST VW/AUDI PRODUCT.Addendum 12/16: Audi will buy back the car at the end of this month. While it seems to be running OK after two 10-day long visits to the shop, the check engine light came on shortly after the $1500 repair to the waste gate, with the same error code! The dealer said \"we would be glad to take a look at it.\" I asked if that meant (like after the first repair failed) they would charge $135 per hour to diagnose it. They said they would diagnose it to the tune of $500 worth. I did not take it in, as I will not put any more money into it. I am letting it sit in the garage until the buy back in two weeks. Audi and particularly my local dealership are awful. Fun car not disapointed Bought it used with 33K miles and have put another 12K since then. Love the ride, handling, very fun car on my painful 1 hour commute to work every day. Since it\\'s more sporty suspension is a bit stiff so not the couch comfort but that\\'s how German cars are. It does lack some options you would think should be in an Audi; auto dimming mirrors, memory seats, passenger power seats but doesn\\'t bother me personally. Slight turbo lag in taking off but you can shift to manual mode and it picks up right away. Can\\'t beat the mileage, 36 daily -41 highway. All owners MUST have an extended warranty!! I was so excited to buy this car.  It looks great, gets above average gas mileage and I thought it was going to be dependable...I was absolutely incorrect and it has cost me a significant amount of money!  The warranty expired at 50k, which is when the major system began to fail.  First it was the motor in the seat...not a huge deal, but it was expensive.  Next the A/C compressor failed, an issue that Audi is aware of and has issued a service advisory about, but without a warranty, one that I had to pay for.  Finally the Turbo charger failed. At this rate it will have all new parts before it hits 60k.  This car is crap and Audi should be ashamed that they built it.   Reliability Issues I have owned for 2 years and put 55K miles on my A3 TDI.Bought car for performance and great MPG - commute is 100 miles per day.With 500 miles left on warranty Mechatronics unit went - first time had issues was 25K miles and dealer did software update. (it\\'s roughly$3,200 repair if out of warranty).At 54K miles EGR valve clogged with ash - ($800 repair & AUDI offered no help) I called AudiUSA and got nowhere.DO NOT BUY this car for MPG savings, you\\'ll give it all back in repairs. Overall nice car but, I also own 2 Toyotas and I\\'m spoiled by the fact that they don\\'t break...I had always heard that Audi/VW reliability issues were a problem, definitely some buyer\\'s remorse on A3 Outstanding Performance So far, I am very satisfied with my new Audi A3 Diesel. The performance is really exceptional. It accelerates smoothly and corners very well. I am very happy with the build quality. Great Blend of Fun and Fuel Economy I recently bought an A3 TDI and have enjoyed the first 2k miles.35 mpg with fairly aggressive mixed city/hwy driving.I like not having to baby it to get good mileage.The car is very stable and composed at highway speeds and in the daily S. Florida rainstorms.If you test drive it, look for two things.1) Diesel motor tick.It has such aquiet cabin that you may not hear it in a test drive.You\\'ll hear it in your driveway though.Make sure it is not an issue for you. 2) Its truly an automated manual transmission it \"catches\" when coming to a slow stop, just like a manual does.Those not used to manuals may not like the feel.I love it though and am very happy with the purchase. Beware of heated seat issues In most categories, I love this car.I like the look, the fuel economy, it\\'s fun to drive and has a great stereo.The turbo lag does take some getting used to - When accelerating from a stop, it can take a full second or two for the turbo to engage.It\\'s very responsive once you\\'ve started moving.Fuel economy is great and overall, it\\'s really a fun little car.However, you should be aware that the heated seats are basically useless.My dealer explained that they have heard numerous complaints about them and that they perform \\'to Spec\\'.If you Google Audi Heated seats, you\\'ll find several Audi forums discussing the issue.If you love heated seats like I do, know that they don\\'t work. Almost There - but Audi got a bit cheap on this vehicle Any car like this one with an MSRP over $33k should definitely have some common features: garage door opener, power passenger seats, memory settings, auto-dimming mirrors, and automatic headlights.Most of these things cost the manufacturer almost nothing to install, but Audi left them off the A3.This tells me they think the target market is not an upscale or move-up buyer who would expect these things.But I\\'d bet many other less-expensive vehicles have some or all of these features.All this aside - I really like this car.I was torn between an A3 and a Jetta TDI SportWagen, but went with the Audi because of a few better features.And it looks much better. Relatively Great Fun I\\'m coming from the perspective of a family with young kids that has relied on Outbacks and older Nissan/Acura sedans. Our newish Outback serves as our workhorse car, so we felt more free to replace our aging 2nd car with a smaller non-all wheel drive car. We\\'ve been very happy with the handling and performance of the A3. I\\'ve gone through NE winters with front wheel drive and snow tires, and expect the A3 to do just fine. It feels plenty fast to us, and the handling and responsiveness is a clear cut above what we\\'d been used to. My wife was a bit hesitant about it after the first test drive, not being used to a diesel engine, but now even she says it\\'s the perfect car for us. roomy, great mileage, and a luxury ride I previously owned a 2008 all electric A3 3.2 and it was a great car.  I hated to trade it but decided I wanted all the technology and driver assist offered in the newer models.  Waited through the periods of no gas sport backs imported into the US, then the \"clean\" diesel debacle, then waited to see how the e-tron worked out.  It\\'s a 10.  Admittedly I had to get used to the fact that the 1.4 is a very different drive than my old 3.2.  That engine was amazing, but in truth it was a way more powerful car than I really needed or used, although the drive was great fun, but the nav was a CD that only knew the roads up to 2008.  (a CD!)  I\\'ve had the e-tron (Prestige trim) for 6 months, love it.  Got the Bosch charger for the garage and total charge in 2 hours.  My electric bill is unchanged.  My mileage is far better than advertised. I consistently get close to 30 mpg on the charge, and even when I use both gas and electric I get 75 mpg in normal conditions, and over 50 even in stop and go nightmare traffic.  Admittedly, I am a pretty chill driver, but I deal with LA traffic periodically and still get great mileage.  The comfort is great - the backseat is a little tight for long distances but totally adequate for around town.  And the back is as luxury as the front.  Another improvement is that the closed moon roof filters more light than it did in my old 2008, which in southern California is a good thing. The versatility of the A3 is what sells me - the hatchback turns the small car into a truck - pop down the back seats and the cargo space is amazing - I can fit bikes, furniture, large cartons, just about anything in there.  For groceries etc the cargo space without pushing down the seats is more than adequate. Fun and practical I was at the end of my lease with a BMW i3 REX and I needed something a bit bigger. I looked at 7 cars, from BMW 330e to Ford Fusion plug-in and Honda Clarity Plug-in. I read all the reviews and watched many you tube videos where people were raving about their plug-ins. Then I test drove all of them (couple of times!) Let me tell you this, you can’t get all the features on any car unless you have something custom built for you. But after balancing it all and look at all the pros and cons, e-tron was the logical choice. I have driven it few days now and I love it. Coming from an i3 I was worried that I would be sitting lower to the ground. No problem. The car has so many great qualities that I quickly forgot about sitting low. Electric range is lower than i3. If you need more electric range, you should look at Honda Clarity Plug in or i3 REX. Small compartments could get a revisit as there are not many. Was that the deciding factor? Not really. The other thing: if you want Navigation the price jumps by about 7000 as it only comes in expensive packages. I chose to go without Navi and enjoy the craftsmanship Audi has done on the car. I am interested to see what other people say in their reviews as I did not see any at the time of my posting. Love my A3 e-tron. Thrilled I went with the e-tron... I leased this car 6 months ago and don\\'t regret it, at all. I had an S3 prior and the savings each month for fuel total over $100. I fill up my e-tron once a month at a total cost of around $28 per trip to the gas station. That\\'s Los Angeles gas prices, too. It\\'s a very sought after vehicle (I work for a local Audi dealer) and I know this car holds it\\'s value well. We can\\'t keep them in stock. If you can get your hands on one, get it! You won\\'t regret it. Plus there is the tax credit for getting one that\\'s $1,500 in your pocket. I also have the clean air stickers too that added value to my car for spending a measly $22. Sweeet hybrid The ev range appears to be pretty much as advertised.  upon starting a trip, you have the option of selecting ev only, hybrid, or maintain battery.  If you trip is ~20miles, the ev only works well.  If it is over ~20 miles, then selecting hybrid appears to net between 60 - 70 mpg.  Running purely on gas it appears to be in the region of 40 - 45 mpg.  The rid is pure Audi - very quick and secure.  Other then the increased mpg, there is no difference between the feel of this car verses a pure gas version.  The integration of the electric and gas engines is completely smooth - you can\\'t tell when one starts and the other leaves off.  Very well done! Etron This car is awesome in ev mode. Very quiet with excellent acceleration. It\\'s even better in sport mode using the gas and electric engines. In hybrid mode, anytime you lift off the gas the engine shuts down, the car coasts effortlessly . There is a little engine noise on the highway but not too bad. Engine restart is quiet and vibration free. Sport seats are very comfortable with four way lumbar adjustments. Once you figure out the menus, bt connection with streaming works flawlessly. I only wish that there was more than about 23 miles in ev mode. Battery Range is 10-12 miles If you\\'re buying this car because it has a battery, consider something else. If you drive this care like it\\'s an Audi you can expect 10-12 miles/charge. If you drive it like a Chevy then maybe you can 15-16 miles/charge. Handles fine; sits really low to the ground. o visibility isn\\'t great. A3 e-Tron Prestige Review - Nice Car! Update Jul 2018Just completed 25000 mile service, there was a battery software update performed at no charge during visit. The tires are wearing quicker than I would have expected (Contiental EcoPro?) but other than that no issues. Charging cable issue went away, and dealer can\\'t duplicate the minor cold squeaking issue yet, but there are 20K miles of warranty left. Fuel economy was the same, just over 50mpg combined with 49% battery and 51% gas, we did several  long 11 hour drives. Looking at the resale value, it has dipped quite a bit for the 3rd year, which what Edmunds predicted, my guess it would increase (less depreciation)  as the price of gas goes up and people get rid of SUV\\'s. Overall we are still satisfied with the car.Update January 2018Have owned the car 13 Months and it now has 17000 miles. The car is charged nightly and averages a little over 52 MPG overall with the the MMI indicating a little over 51% gas motor/49% electric motor. The car has two issues that need too be addressed in a service appointment next week. First the front end creaks and squeaks over bumps, especially noticeable when slow. Second, there is an issue with either the charging cable or the charging system as intermittently the car will only partially charge after being plugged in,  to about 1/2 charge. Overall, we still like the car and find it a good value, and cancelled out Tesla M3 reservation.Update  July 2017Have owned the car for 7 months and driven it 5500 miles. The car has been trouble free and the only warranty issue was the side assist computer was inoperative when I bought the car, and the dealer it fixed with no issue. With mixed driving and plugging in at home nightly and we are averaging over 60 mpg. On battery charge alone we average 18-20 miles.  I would not recommend purchasing a level 2 charger for you home as the Audi supplied charger completely recharges in 8 hours. We found a very nice aluminum wall mount that fits the Audi Charger perfectly for $100 on Etsy. We really like the car, especially the adaptive cruise control and lane assist warning. It\\'s very quiet and comfortable. The audio system is first rate. (B&O). The navigation interface (MMI) takes some getting used to. The car had a 6 month trial for the Audi Connect, and I let it expire. The car never loaded the destinations properly from the phone app, and I can\\'t see paying $10 plus a month for google maps. Hopefully with the next version of the software the app and interface will get better. We have a reservation for a Tesla Model 3, and this was to be the bridge car. Welike the Audi enough to consider not getting the Tesla.Original ReviewPurchased a used A3 e-Tron lease turn in a little over a month ago with 3300 miles. This is my first Audi. It is a very nice car, and so far a good value, especially since the used price reflects the first owners receiving federal and state tax credits. The car is very quiet, comfortable, handles well and efficient. I only have limited access to plug in charging, so I charge it about 3 times per week. With a full charge I normally get 13-17 miles on pure EV mode and in hybrid mode average about 41MPG. The last tank combining 4 plug in charges and a full tank, it averaged just over 51 mpg with mixed hwy (75%)/city (25%) driving. Its not the EPA advertised 83mpgE, but is what I expected based on the reviews I read. I agree as other reviewers have said, if your daily commute is over the pure EV range, just put it in hybrid mode to maximize your plug in charges. The ability to select charge mode at the end a long trip to use EV mode for city commuting, a feature that I heard was discontinued on the 2017 model is also a plus. I also like the clean simpleness of the interior layout and minimizing of buttons, especially the placement of the radio on/off/volume/track select button on the lower console. This car has the adaptive cruise control and pre collision braking, both which are awesome and worth the extra price! The items which I am not so impressed with are the B&O sound system and Audi Connect. The sound system is adequate, but lacks the bass response that my other vehicles have (Bose). The e-tron does not offer memory seats/mirrors which was disappointing since it was the highest Prestige trim level. I still cannot get the Audi Connect App to fully work after talking with the courteous and helpful Audi phone people twice. It wont push directions to the NAV and wont display all the Audi Connect features, nor remotely turn on the A/C. The Nav screen is adequate, but frustrating at times to use the wheel interface to input destinations. Since this car is new tech for VW/Audi, I would recommend purchasing the extended warranty and prepaid maintenance plans. Overall, I am satisfied with the car. What is the TRUE Mileage of the Audi eTron I\\'d like to share with you my experience with the mileage of my Audi A3 eTron. This is similar to what I wrote on Yelp a couple of weeks ago. I\\'m giving this review 1 star because the car did not meet my mileage expectation for a plugin-hybrid car. I purchased my 2016 Audi A3 eTron around 6 months ago hoping that I can:  1. continue to be motivated to support our planet by going electric / hybrid; 2. get the best gas mileage (savings) with a powerful car; and, 3. get the carpool lane sticker. So given my first 2 goals, I thought that I \"upgraded\" when I changed my Toyota Prius to the Audi A3 eTron. I was totally misled by the advertising of this plug-in hybrid car. And now I\\'m beginning to think that I actually made a \"downgrade.\" AUDI USA claims that the A3 eTron can run 83 miles per gallon on hybrid mode. This number 83 was on the window sticker when I got the car. And the salesman also told me that the eTron can go 83 miles per gallon on gas + electric mode. First thing that came in my mind is the huge savings that I can get considering that my Hybrid Prius can only deliver around 48 miles per gallon (Toyota claims that the Prius can go 52 miles). Second thing that came in my skeptical mind is not to believe the advertising. So given my experience with my Prius, I thought that if AUDI USA would put a claim of 83 miles, maybe they really meant around 75 miles (given a 10% error on their estimate). But 75 miles per gallon is still huge savings. Third, if one of my objectives is to save money, then why consider buying a \"luxury\" or high end car. Why not just settle with a Prius? or a Volt? Just because I purchased a more expensive car does not mean I waive my rights to complain about its mileage. The advertising still says 83 miles. And so I purchased my AUDI A3 eTron at Audi San Diego in Miramar Road. Don\\'t get me wrong. It is a great car. Its just that it cannot run 83 miles per gallon on hybrid mode as claimed by AUDI USA. Why? I\\'m still unclear about the explanation given to me by Audi San Diego (Valerie from their GM\\'s Office). So I brought my car to the same dealership where I purchased it for service. I asked AUDI San Diego to test my car because I only can get around 45 miles per gallon on hybrid mode. YES! 45 miles not 83 miles not 75 miles! The biggest disconnect for me is that AUDI San Diego service department did not even know that the A3 eTron offers 83 miles per gallon mileage. The sales department is just beside their service department. Perhaps the eTron is still new. The service department said that if I only get around 45 miles per gallon, maybe its because of my driving style and my usage (city/highway/etc). Given I\\'m the worst driver in the world, my mileage should not be half of what the car claims that it can do. And so I left my car to the dealership so they can test it. And they reported to me that my car can go 44 miles per gallon and not 83 miles as being claimed on their advertising. Valerie from the office of the dealer\\'s General Manager responded to my review at Yelp.com and explained to me that I should be happy with my mileage because based on the report that she got, the eTron should only be running 39 miles per gallon on hybrid mode and my car is running 45 mpg. What confused me is that she quoted and placed the link from plugincars.com. Why she used the explanation from plugincars.com got me confused. Is plugincars.com part of Audi? Does Audi has its own explanation for my concern? She also said that if I have further questions, contact Audi USA. OMG! What is the TRUE Mileage of the Audi eTron - now I don\\'t know. Perfect Fit We bought this car for my wife. She\\'s wanted a plug-in electric as she has driven hybrids since 2007. We looked at the e-tron and the Volt. She was impressed with the Volt but after driving the e-tron, she said there was no comparison. She has never stated that a car was fun to drive. She did after driving the Audi. To her a car is an appliance.  There is compromises with the e-tron particularly wit the range.  In our case my wife has a 5 mile commute to work.  The 16 miles of electric is sufficient. So far, she has ranged from a low of 16 miles, (90+ degrees out, AC running non-stop) to 23 miles (70 out, minimal AC). On a trip from our home in Hershey Pa to Charlottesville, VA we ran it on hybrid mode and got 42 mpg. Other than that road trip, she\\'s not needed gas. It\\'s been 4 weeks since we last filled it, driven 400 miles and it\\'s still on Full. If the etron fits your needs - buy it! If you need more range, then the Volt is an excellent car too. In our case, with a short daily commute, the Audi is a perfect fit. With discounts, credits etc. we are in for $37k on the Audi versus $35k for the Volt. But we got power seats & moon roof for that difference in price.Update - We took a road trip from Hershey PA to Hackettstown, NJ.  Approx. 100 mi. each way.  We averaged 45 mpg running in Hybrid mode.  We\\'ve now learned all the nuances of the selectable driving modes.  For road trips, we put it in Hybrid mode to optimize the gas/electric mileage.  For the daily commute, she leaves it in the default EV (electric only) and runs without the gas engine.  Update 8 months of ownership - First off the gas engine\\'s turbo blew at 3500 mi.  Not a good sign.  We\\'ve had it back awhile but since my wife uses it mostly on electroc it hasn\\'t been truly tested.  As for the electric - it\\'s great.  She goes 600-800 miles between gas fill ups due to her short work commutes. She\\'s averaging 89.0 mpg! Great little car.  Now let\\'s see.Great car that fits our needs perfectly!Update 18 months of ownership - the car has been perfect since the turbo issue.  It\\'s extremel reliable gets great mileage.  My wife is up to 110 mpg since she can commute to work and back on electric.  The interior is still perfect.  The handling rock solid. My wife loves this car like none before it.  She loves to drive it.  She has said she\\'ll get a new one when she\\'s ready.  Great car that fits our needs. The Best Choice I drive Audi\\'s for the past 20 years I lease the E tron 100% AAA no concerns or any problems having a tons of fun. A3 Etron is all Audi no auto-engine start. class action lawsuit coming Got the car in 2-2016.  About a dozen times, it went from electric to Hybrid with no warning and with plenty of charge available.  Audi said I was going too fast. How fast does one go when one is going thru the driveway to the garage?  Three times the radio just stopped playing. Had to stop the car and re start it to get the radio to work.  Check Engine light went on twice for no reason (Yes, I did check the gas cap).  I paid extra for an electric car and got a hybrid about 1% of the time. Reliability Unproven Our 2016 Audi A3 e-tron has had to go back to the dealer twice within a month for different issues. The first time the check engine light came on, it was a cooling pump issue. The second time it was an emissions control problem. The dealer supplied us with a much more costly A6 Quattro loaner each time, but we missed our car as it took nearly a week each time for the repairs to be done. Why? The dealer had to order parts from Germany. Apparently U.S. dealers have not received a lot of the parts needed to do anything beyond ordinary maintenance. Also, when the service department is busy, it can take two days just to find out what\\'s wrong. I\\'m sure glad they have loaners. Want when the 2017 is out and VW Settlement done I\\'ve been looking at this car very seriously for about a month, and with interest for about 4 months.  I have taken two test drives of the 2016 model and done lots of online research as well.   It is \"fun\" to drive and economical.  When the VW diesel settlement is final, and the 2017 is available, I will probably get one. Fantastic technology I sold my VW Jetta sportwagon TDI (which I loved) to take advantage of newer technology and safety features.  It took me a couple tanks of gas to figure out how to use the computer system...but now that I understand, the results have been very impressive.  I\\'m in sales and spend a lot of time on the highway...which is not the best place for a hybrid, but my fuel economy is still 40% better than my diesel.  If I\\'m taking a short trip, I leave the computer in the default EV mode.  Otherwise, I immediately put the system in the hybrid mode and the computer does a very effective job of balancing the battery and engine use.  With about 5,000 miles on my car, I\\'ve been averaging 58 miles per gallon (with a lot of highway driving)....about 20 mpg better than my diesel.  If you only drive highway miles, a hybrid might not be the best choice...but if you\\'re like most people, a hybrid does an amazing job.  This week I\\'ve done mostly local driving and I\\'m averaging around 74 mpg. Best of both worlds! My last two cars were a 2002 Lexus IS300 sport sedan and a 2008 Prius, and the Audi A3 Etron blends and exceeds the best of both those vehicles.  Handling, acceleration, and comfort are excellent, and I have averaged 82 mpg over the first two years of ownership.  I appreciate the car\\'s simple, understated (non-dorky) appearance, which is something that seems hard to come by in the plug-in segment.  The A3 Etron wasn\\'t cheap to buy, but has been relatively cheap to operate.  I buy a tank of gas every 4-6 weeks, and otherwise run around town on electric most of the time.  The $4,500 tax credit was very nice, also.  Overall, it\\'s a great car, and one I will be happy to own and drive while I wait for the Tesla Model 3. Perfect? No. Good Balance? Yep. This is my first Audi and first plugin. While there are some things that aren\\'t perfect (I\\'m looking at you radio/climate system), overall this is a very pleasing car.Who buys this thing? Gas is cheap at the time of this review, so you don\\'t buy an Audi plugin to save money, exactly. Who buys it then is someone who likes the handling and style of the Audi and is willing to pay a bit more for it, but still wants to do the environment a good turn. I doubt they\\'ll sell a lot of these.Still, for me, this car fit the bill. And I\\'m overall quite pleased. I\\'ve had it 2 months and still have over half the original tank of gas in it. I\\'m averaging around 270 MPG. I do that by managing how I drive and making sure to arrange things to drive on electric as much as I can. This clearly is not something everyone will want to do. For shorter trips and my daily commute, I run all EV. For longer trips, I put it into hybrid mode from the start and let the car decide when to use the battery. Performance: hate to disappoint performance enthusiasts, but I\\'ve never floored the car. I bought it for a reason and I stick to that. I have hit it harder in EV mode when I pulled out and misjudged the distance of the car coming. It went to around 60% and I was frankly shocked at the acceleration. This is because when you\\'re driving it \\'normally,\\' it seems to be tuned so that it feels weak. But noooooo, noooo, it\\'s not weak. Cornering-wise, this thing is beyond awesome, but that\\'s coming from a guy who has driven non-Audis before. Hey, it helps my MPG to go around corners without braking, right?I have two main complaints, mainly with the controls. Why can\\'t I switch radio stations without taking my eyes off the road? Seriously, there are like 18 radio controls and they all require me to look at one of two LCD displays. Sorry, but I miss being able to hit button #3 and know that I\\'ll get a certain station. They un-invented that. Second, there seems to be no way to just let clean air vent into the car in the winter. For a plugin, this does make a difference. Using the heater costs me miles. When it\\'s not THAT cold out, I\\'d rather just vent rather than have a choice between a) fogged windows and b) use my battery to get the vent temp up.If you\\'re looking for a racecar, why are you even reading this? if you\\'re looking for the best plugin hybrid, you should probably go see a Volt. But if you are looking for a way to do a good turn for the environment, to do it in style, and to have some pep when you want to let it loose, this car is worth a look. Is it a good value? Depends. Mine cost around $35K after the Fed rebate. This puts in territory of normal small luxury cars and normal plugin hybrids. I\\'m not sure I\\'m \\'saving\\' money exactly with this car, but I am pleased I bought it.Update after a year and a half of ownership: I don\\'t have anything major to change and still think it\\'s a 4 star car. I found that by pulling some tricks and putting in some effort I can boost the mileage I get on electric. But that begs the question: why do I have to work harder to get the most out of my Audi? The reason, as far as I can tell, is that Audi sits in a performance mindset, and for them the electric motor is a way to boost performance, with mileage an afterthought. I mean, car has a sports mode that is easily accessible, but no eco mode at all. That\\'s the main gripe, but overall it\\'s a very versatile and economical car. Poor Hybrid Implementation We are long term Audi owners.  We traded in the infamous A3 TDI and own A4, A5 and TT.  Honestly, the TDI was a great car.  Too bad it was spewing so much pollution and worse, Audi lied about it by calling it \"clean\".  So now we have an etron.  Although mechanically, this car is great, the software, communications and electronics for the hybrid are so extraordinary poor, I would not recommend this car to anybody.  The benefit of a hybrid, is so you can hopefully reduce your operating cost.  Electric companies provide significant savings for people who can schedule their charging their cars at night and at work.  However, the software and communications for the car must work to make that happen.  Audi\\'s software simply does not work.  Yes, they are aware of the problems.  Yes, they are working on it.  However, after 1.5 months, they still cannot get it working and they have no idea when it will be de-bugged.  Thus, the benefits of having a hybrid simply do not exist with this vehicle.  The other most dangerous problem, is that the RFID keys \"almost\" work.  The etron matches the VIN number to the key.  However, if they do not communicate perfectly, the instrument indicates that it does not recognize the key and wont start.  Unfortunately, it does not do it all of the time.  So we now must carry both sets until they figure out the problem.  Perhaps this car will be ready 2017 or so.  We are fans of Audi, but this car is not ready for Prime Time.  We want our pollution spewing TDI back. Wishing more electrified miles This 2016 A3 e-tron drives like a proper Audi. My previous car was a 2006 A3 Sportback, the first generation A3 in the US shores. This new car\\'s driving dynamics is very similar to that car, which is a good thing. I do wish that Audi gave it a larger battery because driving in all electric EV mode in this car is very quiet and very satisfying. The 1.4 engine when it turns on is also quiet and more than capable. There were a few internet connection hiccups in the beginning with the e-tron connect service, but that eventually got sorted out.Update:With the warmer months approaching, I\\'m now able to consistently drive between 20-22 all electric miles (the on board computer usually reads 25-28 AER). The e-tron drives fantastic with just the electric motor. Audi made the right choice by giving it enough juice (85 kW) to pull away from traffic lights and freeway on-ramps on electric power alone. Selecting Hybrid Auto or Sport mode (Hybrid Hold), a driver has access to all 204 HP and 260 ft-lb of torque. One pedal driving with strong regeneration is possible with Sport mode or manual mode on the Tiptronic.e-tron connectivity service can sometimes hiccup. But I believe this is due to Verizon Telematic\\'s finicky signal that is built-in to every e-tron. After 12 years, still the best German sedan I had many German cars.4 Mercedes,3 BMW, 2 VW,1 Audi and 2 Lexus.I sold my 2006 Audi A8L, to buy a very low mileage 2001 Audi S8. I felt in love with this car, since the first day I saw it, many years ago.The newer A8L is bigger and more luxurious than the older S8, but the S8 gives me a lot of pleasure to drive. It is fast, fun and reliable. I use to get tired of my cars after 6 months. Not this one ! I will keep it for a very long time. The engine on this cars is bulletproof. The main problem they have is the transmission. Most likely it will need a new one, between 120k - 180k. By the way, most cars need a new tranny at that time. It is a timeless masterpiece. My favorite car ever. Icon The best Audi I\\'ve ever owned! The S8 was an over-engineered vehicle by Audi.This has been, hands down, the most reliable, most value-for-the-buck Audi I\\'ve ever owned.It\\'s virtually impossible to make the decision to trade it in for a $10k-$12k downpayment for a...mid-size sedan of any type!Amazing build quality, power (even 11 years since first rolled out), comfort, and passive/active safety.My 2001 S8 has 75K miles, and I intent to keep it until it reaches into the 100Ks... Amazing Automobile This German car is for drivers; people who love to drive. Of any car I have ever owned this is the one I would pick if I had to drive across the country. It reminds me of an NFL linebacker, big, swift, powerful and nimble all at the same time. I originally purchased it with 92000 miles. It now has 140000 and all I have replaced is tires, idler pulley and serpentine belt and fuel pump. I use 0W40 synthetic oil in it. My wife is now driving it and has fallen in love. She says that it spoils you as you start rating all cars against it, which is unfair. Only 531 imported into us in 2001-2003. It is a German muscle machine made for drivers. DOT governed at 155 mph. (too bad) Supercar My S8 has a few years on it and I am still absolutely in love with it.  I was looking for a sports-orientated car that could carry car seats and groceries and get around in the snowy Pittsburgh winters.  This car manages to do that and more - it\\'s like three cars in one!  An SUV for winter, a sports sedan for summer and a 4 dr family hauler for all times in between.  It\\'s rock solid at high speed, fun to drive and pulls like a locomotive from a stop light!  Plus it\\'s faster than almost everything that\\'s going to line up next to you on the street - and you always look like a hero pulling away without wheel spin. It\\'s a true German sleeper.   New Car This car is a sports car in a sedan body. Even though it\\'s technically a large car, it doesn\\'t drive like one. The acceleration is almost instant and is plenty fast for all street driving.  Q Ship This is my favorite sedan in the world for a four season climate.  Understated competence, subtle luxury, mysteriousness, and timeless style. I drive it daily, but it shines brightest on 3 or 4 passenger road trips to ski destinations, everyone is supremely comfortable as I power through snow drifts and navigate icy corners. The S8 is very fast and light on her feet because of the strong V8 and light aluminum frame, but cops don\\'t notice her.  Pretty darn good mileage for 360 hp, amazing interior finish that is not too complicated or gizmo oriented. Gorgeous dash at night, all the creature comforts you can ask for (ahem, except good cupholders!). It is a fantastic car. Cool points out the window Well I must admit to being newly enamored with the S8 as I just bought one. I like others don\\'t care for the Nav system compared to what $200.00 will buy now, I suppose it was ok in its time.  My Own Private Lear Jet This is a wonderful car all around and fast and nimble like a Lear jet.  Comfort, performance, total package with that understated look.  Prefer it over S500 or 740 anyday. Sports Sedan of the Decade The 01 to 03 S8 is the best sports sedan of the last 20 years.  It is an all business, aluminum engineered masterpiece.  Ask any engineer with knowledge and they will agree.  I bought it Audi certified with no regrets.  I strongly advise buying one of these S8s if you are into subtle from the outside and awesome from the inside type of driving experience.  I read another review before I bought that described it as a 4 door Porsche 911... I agree.  My wife thought I was nuts for buying a 4 year old car (certified), but now fights for the keys.  Can easily carry 2 kids and gear on any excursion.  Would buy a certified one with warranty again!! Fantastic Driving Experience I just bought a 2001 S8.  It\\'s my first foreign car.  I am completely amazed at this cars performance.  I have yet to come close to testing it\\'s abilities but I thoroughly enjoy blowing away any one that thinks they can outperform me!  Complete luxury inside, total power and very understated.  It\\'s big inside, took getting used to for a smaller woman. A fantasic car My last three cars were Audis, and this one has been the best so far. I used to own a 2000 S4, but I enjoy driving this Audi S8 because of it\\'s larger size and it has more comfort and room. I just purchased a new 2005  Audi W12, so I am selling the 2001 Audi S8 on the internet. Hopefuly others will find out what a truly great car the Audi S8 is, not to mention how unique and rare this automobile is, when you want something a little different try an Audi. I am pretty tired of all the BMWs and Mercedes I see on the road so I felt this car was more unique.  Super Car My other car is a Porsche 911 and I don\\'t know  The Best High End Car EVER! I\\'ve owned a Mercedes-Benz S600, a BMW \\r745i, and a Rolls-Royce and I can say \\rthat if your looking for a car that not \\ronly has enough power to blow off a \\rCorvette and enough room for 5 people, \\rthis is your car.  I love driving it, \\rits like a dream!  Much better than my \\rgas hog V-12 Mercedes. (although not \\rquite as comfortable)  I\\'ve had no \\rproblems with mine so far and am very \\rhappy with my purchase! What a RocketShip This understated rocketship lets those  Audi SA a good alternative to a BMW 7XX This is by far the best high end sedan  okay car i am glad audi is ree desighning this  Makes you smile The 2013 Audi S8 felt like quality just rolling out of the dealership. Driving it home, it just got better. Solid, fast and quality everywhere you look. It\\'s difficult not to smile every time you\\'re behind the wheel and look for excuses to run and errand. Fantastic vehicle Fun to drive. Incredibly fast when in \"S\" mode.Comfortably seats 5. Great interior craftsmanship. Even my wife said she could see what was \"so special\" about the car. Definitely consider Certified Pre-owned if available because potential repair costs would be astronomical. The perfect all-weather supersedan After 3 years in a Porsche 911 Carrera S, I decided I\\'d been battered & deafened long enough.  The S8 is the perfect replacement - a coddling, comforting living room when you need peace and quiet.  But when you need to scream, it will gladly scream for you.  The baritone bark of the V10 is unrivaled by any other luxury sedan, and the acceleration is phenomenal, with quick \"whomp whomps\" of the paddle shifted transmission.  Yet, unlike the 911, the S8 feels utterly stable -- no wiggly sense of instability or choppiness.    On the highway, it is impeccable, quiet, yet ready to blast into triple digits at a moment\\'s notice.  It is subtle looking, yes, but people still notice it due to rarity. Outstanding Vehicle! This is the most outstanding car I\\'ve ever driven.  I also own a Mercedes SL600 (with a Kleemann power upgrade) and in the morning, I find myself reaching for the S8 keys.  This car is a very fast sedan, but what I really love about it (besides the all wheel drive for Wisconsin winters) is that it is so comfortable to drive and that the dash layout is so simple and intuitive. This is the first sedan that I have ever found to be exciting to drive.  The paddle shifters are way cool. Refined experience for refined tastes I traded my 997 to to get what I perceived to be a peaceful luxury car that delivers a violent, soulful motor on command. I couldn\\'t be happier. No more annoying tire noise competing with the sometimes flatuent, contrived exhaust note. Instead I get full luxury (including double-paned windows and felt lined wheel-wells to ensure tranquility) punctuated by refined violence upon driver demand.  I also get an ipod interface and bluetooth. When I miss my 997 I can always take out my 87 911 for a visceral run. And when I really require a jolt my F355 delivers without fail. The S8 is always the car I reach for first... that says a lot. Big disapointment I bought my S8 because I believed it would be a fun-to-drive, relatively light weight fast sedan. It has ponderous handling, shifts erratically, and is full of insanely complicated, useless electronics. The suspension lowers itself after parking, so that the car has to be parked rear-end-first so the front doesn\\'t hang up on the curb. I tried to give it back the 2nd day I had it, but Audi refused, as S8s are special order.  Not a bad car I wanted a car that was good in the snow but also had good performance, this fits the bill. Great!! The is such a great car! I bought an S550 4matic for myself, but there just wasn\\'t enough power there for me. I saw the S8 drive by and my son (who is 13, and knows a lot about cars) told me I had to check it out. So we drove right to the Audi dealership, and ordered it. I have since given my wife the S550, and she wants to have my car. I really enjoy this car, and it is powerful, and has the fourwheel drive. We live right outside of Philly, and we do get snow so that four wheel drive is great to have. It you can buy it I would definitely recommend doing so. Blown Away by the S8 The S8 is the German automobile perfected.  Flawless engine, superior ride and handling, classic styling and the absolute best interior available at any price point.  Compared to the Jaguar XJ8 much more refined.  Compared to the BMW 750/760 better in almost every way ergonomically.  Also far superior interior.  Compared to the Mercedes S550 again the interior is more luxurious and the engine blows the S550 away.   2007 Audi S8 I decided that maybe Audi had just created the perfect luxury car.  After 3k miles I believe they have.  It is perfectly silent when you want it to be.  Want to be sporty?  One or two down shifts and a tap of the right foot and you know you are in the right car.  The electronics are well thought out too.  Handling stuns.  The throttle is not too sensitive.  No problem (did they fix it?). Looks?  Subjective, yes, but it makes a very discrete statement.  I am very happy my S8.  And I don\\'t miss my 997 a bit. This car was built for me.  Incredible!! I traded in a BMW 645 Cabriolet for the S8 and at the time was worried that I might miss the BMW.  After 4 days of driving the S8, I can honestly say that I made the right move.  And I moved up in a big way. Top of all cars I have owned and driven all cars from S500 to Porsche to BMW to Maserati to Ferrari. This is by far the best car I have owned and driven. It is a car which one can drive hard or soft. The full option version is one to go for which is with the Bang and Olufsen stereo - this is a must it really improves a sound quality. Great Decision As with the few other owners, I debated the choices.  When it came right down to it, making the selection for an S8 was more about uniqueness, performance, comfort and subtlety.  What I didn\\'t expect when making the decision, and to my great surprise (since it is almost impossible to test drive them prior to purchase) was: 1) how great it handles, drives and performs, 2) how modern the electronics are (iPod and satellite and telephone integration; systems and suspension control), 3) how comfortable it is AND how much fun it is to drive, and 4) that it keeps getting better.  I find the power band perfectly tweaked for a luxury sedan - great performance as an automatic, amazing performance as a manual/ tiptronic.  Absolute Beast It\\'s an awesome car. Had it for about 2 months now and yet every time I turn the engine on I can\\'t help but grin like a 12 year old in a candy store.  Having had various luxury cars over the last several years, I can honestly say that I\\'ve never seen a more complete package -- it\\'s an absolute joy to drive. Even though it\\'s relatively similar to the A8, it turns heads everywhere! I often sit in heavy traffic and let me tell you, people (especially other drivers) stare.  The only problem that some people might have is that it can get quite uncomfortable when you have several pairs of eyes glued to you for extended periods of time while you wait for the lights to change. WOW Drive this car on Highway 1 from Carmel to San Simeon and you will be hooked for life. Better by far than my SL 500. Handling, acceleration and the paddles - pure fun - truly wow! A good value My decision was between a Mercedes S550 4 matic sport and the Audi S8. The S550 is nice, but the S8 just felt like something more special.  The v10 engine (smooth and quiet at normal speeds, and unbelievably poweful and \"baritone\" when you want it to be), and the special \"S\" interior and exterior felt like something a step above the norm.  Even the ride (with the std 20 inch rims) is wonderful in comfort mode... unbelievable given the potholes in my part of the country). I average about 15.5 mpg (70% city/30% highway). Not great, but hey, that v10 power/noise has got to come from somewhere.  Net, no regrets so far. Impeccable This car is truly a joy to drive. I have a Maserati as well as an Aston Martin; however, every morning when I wake up and grap my keys. I find myself continually grabbing the Audi Keys. 2003 Audi S8 For me it is the best vehicle so far for all around. It is sporty, classy, family oreinted, stylish, good handling. When you own this car, you do not need sport coupe or SUV. It wil give you  all pleasure and your needs. It\\'s a very good built vehicle. Touch up finish is excellent. Having quattro drive and driving in rain is fun. I will recomend this vehicle for every car fanatic A used 2003 Review Bought through eBay with 98000 on the odometer.  Drove it 2000 miles home in 28 hours. An amazing ride--interior indistinguishable from new. No rattles, no oil consumption, everything works. My 5th used Audi. My recommendation: never buy a new one- -they last 200K miles easily and are used car bargains. I love the dual personality of the S8. A comfortable and quiet crusier that wakes up at 6000 rpm and emits a glorious V8 roar. Handles better than any 4000 pound, 5 pax vehicle should. Love it. The A8L The A8L is a wonderful car to drive.   AMASING EVERYONE DIS CAR IS SIMPLY THE  audi s-8 this is such a fun hard fast car Audi S8 Audi S8 is a FUN car. Kind-of  bmw mercedes killer Excellent handling with quattro \\rweather is minimized. Fun to drive and \\rvery nimble for a large, very \\rluxurious sedan. This car is a real \\rhead turner and no manufacturer does \\rinteriors like Audi. Audi dissapoints In 25,000 miles it\\'s been in for \\rservice 9 different times and I\\'ve been \\rwithout vehicle a total 22 days. Power \\rsteering rack, control module, interior \\rtrim, windshield washer pump, \\rintermitent alarm codes etc. I still \\rlose my power steering off and on \\rregularly. I was told by Sales Manager \\rthat the A8 I traded in would pale in \\rcomparison to the quality of the S8.  \\r$80,000+ sticker! This is as close to a \\rlemon as I\\'ve ever owned. Audi 2002 S8 The 4 wheel drive is great but it \\rdetracts from handling around curves.  \\rLittle creature comforts could be \\rimproved upon (i.e heating steering \\rwheel should be in S8, better \\rnavigation system and computer).  \\rOverall, I would probably not buy again. Audi D2 S8 Beautiful car, beautifully made and engineered.  S8 with Alcantra/Recaro interior. Some of the best seats I have ever sat in. Leather is amazing, very nice solid feel to every bit of the interior.  The engine looks/sounds/feels teriffic. Brakes, suspension, and handling are all very sharp and precise for a car this size. Fuel economy is nothing spectacular, but the car is geared very short compared to its A8 counterpart and is very hard to stay off of the go pedal.  The car does need to be maintained properly. A coil pack and some disconnected vacuum lines have happened. Also an unknown problem with the catylitic conversion system.    Overall a great work of engineering by Audi Amazing I purchased this with 49,000 miles a few months ago.  What an amazing, comfortable car.  It handles nearly as well as my Porsche 968 cab, but is so much more comfortable & quiet!  Bose Stereo/Nav is rubbish and will be replaced in the next few weeks.  If the chance to look at one comes your way, make the effort. S8 Smokin\\' As a former BMW M5 and 7-Series owner I have \\rto say that the Audi S8 tops them both.  \\rThe S8 delivers the comfort of the 7-Series \\rwith the all-out performance of the M5 \\r(but without the cramped cabin).  The \\rride is stff but not harsh and the \\rlightness of the aluminum body and \\rsuspension makes it feel like a much \\rsmaller car than it is.  Nimble like a \\rsports car, yet with plenty of leg \\rroom and a humongous trunk, the S8 \\rgets my vote for the best high-end \\rsports sedan of all time.  Stealth and style Fast, handsome, unobtrusive, the S8 \\rgets my vote for any long-distance car \\rtrip.  Seats and legroom are \\rexcellent.  Acceleration from 65 to 85 \\r(or from 85 to 105 -- but I wouldn\\'t \\rknow) is tremendous.  The price you \\rpay is poor gas mileage.  We love the \\rinterior layout and materials.  Light \\ron its feet for a large car.  Grippy \\rtires, stiff suspension.  Excellent \\rsound system.  Huge trunk. Audi AWESOME EXCELLENT CAR< PERHAPS THE BEST LARGE \\rSEDAN AVAILABLE, SMOKES THE 7! Why All Audis Rule This is BY FAR the best Audi I have \\rever driven, and I\\'ve driven quite a \\rfew.  The ride, power, luxury ... just \\rawesome.  Any doubt that anyone has \\rabout this car is purely groundless.  \\rQuattro = best 4-wheel drive system \\rever.  Cannot be beat.  One and only \\rflaw: Doesn\\'t exactly sip gas... but \\rnot really hard on it either (a 1998 \\rA6 is harder on gas) since it is made \\rof aluminum.  Which is also nice, \\rsince it improves stiffness and safety \\rwithout increasing weight (but \\rincreasing price :).  Still definately \\rworth it.  360 hp = awesome power.  \\rEvery possible luxury appointment has \\rbeen added.  Just an all-around \\rawesome car. 5 passenger 911 Great road car. Steering feels a \\rlittle light but precise. Car feels \\rlighter than it is...Fast, quick to \\rturn-in, balanced in corners, amazing \\rbrakes.\\r Dunlops supplied are a dissapointment. \\rOne blew for no known reason and a \\rsecond develop blister. Remaining 2 \\rhave scalloped badly in under 10k \\rmiles.

GREAT SPORTS SEDAN I HAVE HAD VIRTUALLY NO PROBLEMS WITH  S8 Evaluation Review This S8 has incredibly smooth \\racceleration from the 4.2 liter V8 \\rthat is normally aspirated. No turbo \\ror supercharger jerk. Handling/its \\rvery responsive for its large size \\rwith the Brembo brakes more than ample.\\rAll in all, a great vehicle for open \\rroad driving! fast luxary this is one fast full size huge luxary  Luxary with sport it is pure luxary, with a little sport tossed in to make it fun. The Perfect Car This is the perfect car for someone who needs a large sedan. It has loads of space, a huge trunk, its performance is quite astonishing, yet its appearance does not give it away as blatantly as say an AMG Merc. The quattro makes it possible to drive in any weather. The car also has two personalities: a tame, comfortable luxury sedan and a sports sedan with high-revving (up to 7000 RPM redline) shifts in \\'S\\' mode. Finally, it has the best interior I have ever sat in and its MMI is much simpler to use than either BMW or Merc\\'s systems. Great car, Infuriating Controls Fantastic car. Great handling, styling and quality. The MMI controls will drive you insane. The simplest function becomes very complex.  Turning on the heated seats, solar shade, etc. The navigation system - thought was broken. Numerious major addresses in major cities could not be found. Turns out for 2008 you don\\'t enter the city, but the county of location. That is insane, Florida has like 50 counties. No idea, where one starts and stops. Just as good as the others To say that the S8 lags behind the other luxo-cruisers is only revealed by a few clicks on the stopwatch. In real world application, with its 4x4 drive system, I have found the S8 to be far - vastly - more confidence inspiring than the others. You never feel at the limit or out of shape in the S8 as it seamlessly governs oversteer, understeer and anything else you can throw at it. When I drive the S Class extremely hard, I can get it inside out such that the ESP feels confused. I would even venture to say that in the canyons near SLC, I can drive the S8 faster than its competitors. Its limits are just far more accessible than with the others. Superb car, great controls, powerful  I have upgraded form the A8L to the S8.  Most of optional features are standard.  Suspension firmer and tail shorter.  Steering better calibrated.  The car is clinical, technical and takes time to warm to it.  S550 4-matic has superior steering but S550 has poor interior, poor iPod integration and weak navigation. AWD is superb even in A8. Superb driving in snow, ice. Excellent traction. Rear space is tighter than A8 and S550, but tail handles better.   The best everyday sports car ever made I have owned 3 BMW\\'s, an Audi S5, and a Shelby GT500. This is by far the best everyday sports car one could own. In traffic it behaves and allows one to go with the flow in peace and comfort. You forget it is a beast under the hood. The engine though can roar to life when desired, and the handling is awesome with any weather condition. I had taken my Shelby GT500 on road trips, and just felt beat up at the end of them. Not so in the Audi RS5. It is the perfect mix of power and refinement. I joke with people that if my Audi S5 and my Shelby had a baby it would be this car. I don\\'t know what I will replace it with when the day comes. Production of this car should have continued. I certainly am not looking forward to having a V6 again with the future RS5. I may have to consider the RS7if they keep it a V8. Going on 30,000 For the money this is the most complete driver\\'s car. I have owned it for nearly three years and it still is a blast to drive this on a challenging road. Also it is appreciated that in unpleasant driving circumstances like heavy traffic or driving in a monsterous rain storm the Audi is emminently manageable and exceedingly safe. There is more room on the accelerator then most would need under any condition.My car\\'s engine exploded at 28,000 miles. A spring on the valve lifter shattered leaving smalll frgments of metal in my motor. This resulted in immediate shutdown of the motor and atow to the dealer. Thankfully the car was still under warranty. No acknowlegement by Audi of any defects. I was forced to trade the car in.Very Disappointing. What\\'s it like after 3 years of ownership The other two reviews talk about new RS5\\'s.  If you\\'re reading this now you are looking to buy a used one.  So what is it like after 3 years and 35,000 miles?  I still get compliments wherever I go.  The car still feels special when I get in and drive it.  The engine still amazes - remember this is based on an Italian design so there is not a lot of torque or power until the revs build.....  From around 3700 to 8250 redline it is wonderful.  The transmission is one of the better dual clutch automanuals.  Quick shifts in manual and very smooth in automatic.  Handling is good for a big heavy car.  You don\\'t toss it into corners like my Boxster but the grip is pretty amazing and the special differential that the RS5 has actually makes the car very neutral in cornering.   The dynamic/sport mode and comfort mode make this into a very smooth quiet grand touring car or a car that you can have fun with when the road calls to you. The car has aged very well.  The interior still looks brand new and everything works as it did on day one.   I\\'m thinking that because of the depreciation of German high cost machinery this will be a good deal as a used car.   But you need to find your own as mine isn\\'t going anywhere. Fun to drive, Aggressive looks, Great performance, Limited Production. Fun to drive, yet with drive select, you can make it as aggressive a ride as you want. Custom your modes into 16 combinationsDRL LEDs.Transmission = VERY smooth gear changing.Exhaust sound = loud downshifts, great sounding upshifts and acceleration sounds.Exterior design = subjective.To me, it was aggressive in a very good way.Uniqueness = only 1,500 to be sold and made for the North American market for 2013 and 2014 (check NA Audi President Scott Keogh\\'s video interview).Performance = Based on caranddriver\\'s lightning lap times, it beats the M3, M5, M6, and V8 R8 by a slim margin.Mileage = just enough efficiency to omit the Green tax. Extraordinary I replaced my 2010 S5 with a 2013 RS5 in December.The S5 was great; the RS5 is an order of magnitude beyond that.It handles beautifully (I never considered raving about steering but the way it steers had to be experienced to be believed: whoever thought turning a corner could be so much fun), the controls are well-placed and intuitive.The Google GPS is a treat.Let\\'s face it, no one needs 450 horsepower, but my, my it sure is nice to have it.Do yourself a favor and spring for the sports exhaust, \\'cause if you ever feel depressed all you have to do is sit in your driveway and rev the engine; why take a pill?If that doesn\\'t work, just get it on the road and shift to sports mode. Badass Beast This car has far surpassed all of my expectations in every way.  I\\'ve had this car for three years this month and I still get excited every time I hit the start button and hear that powerful roar of the engine.  It\\'s my second Audi, the previous one was the S5. When I spotted this on the dealer floor I had to have it.  Fun, sporty, and never disappoints.  Warning... for serious adrenaline junkies only. Autocross Ready Very fast, handles great, has a cool built in exhaust note when shifting.   Beautiful lines.  Only downside it the price. Very expensive car to get into.  MSRP $82000 with options. audi 2014 rs5 is the best sports car for the money this is an amazing car,comfortable and roomy for someone over 6\\' 2\",great acceleration and quatro superb handling,comfort seats,spacious overall the most undervalued sportscar,simply great 2018 Red RS3 I’ve had my car for a month now. I find myself inventing reason to drive it, trips to the store for no reason. It’s the only red one I’ve seen on the road to date. Powers great, handling is outstanding and the interior is both comfortable and nicely styled. It’s everything people are saying the RS is.  S3 upgrade well worth it From the initial test drive you’ll notice the power compared to the S3. While the 0-60 is impressive, where you can really notice the difference is 60-100.  The virtual cockpit is incredible, showing you g-force, power and torque all at once (or your full music info, map, etc.). Ride is noticeably stiffer but adjustable when needed unless you get the pricy dynamic plus (skip it and get the other packages which give you more for your $). My second AUDI In 2008, my wife and I bought a new A4 3.2 6 speed manual, with all the features.  We still love it.  After over six years of use with no problems, we began to get a warning that one of the headlights were defective.  I couldn\\'t see anything wrong (they all illuminated correctly, it seemed) so I took it to the Audi Dealer to get it checked out.  While waiting for the fix, my wife and I toured the showroom.  That caught the eye of a salesman of course.  Interested in a new Audi, He asked?  No just getting our \\'08 headlight fixed, I answered.  \\'08?  Might be time to trade, he suggested.  Well, we love our A4 but they don\\'t come with V-6\\'s any more and we like manual gearboxes.  Have you driven a 2.0T? He asked.  Yes, and it isn\\'t even close to the V-6.  I answered.   And I really don\\'t want to spend what a new S4 costs.  He showed us a recently traded in 2012 S4 in near mint condition and I bought it after a short test drive.  After nearly two years, I still love it.  It gets about the same fuel mileage as the \\'08 3.2 A4 (unless you use the extra power the supercharger provides) and it is simply a absolute joy to drive.  I\\'ve owned a lot of nice cars over the years but the V-6 S4 is the perfect combination of power, comfort and prestige. Fantastic Sedan Since watching Ronin many years back when I was an adolescent, I have always dreamed of owning one of Audi\\'s \"S\" cars. I have previously owned two Audi TTs and while having the latest one serviced last Spring, my salesman \"graciously\" let me take an S4 out for the day and I was hooked. A couple hours later I bid farewell to the TT and brought home my new S4 to a not-so-enthused girlfriend. Since then, the car has brought nothing but smiles to my face. It has more than enough power to get you into trouble, yet can be docile enough to chauffeur a group of friends around for a night out. As Ferris says: If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.  Something Special This car is really something.You feel pampered inside, as if it were an XJ, but you can [non-permissible content removed] at any moment.If anything the problem is the car\\'s limits are so far out that you almost never feel like you are going fast.There\\'s no drama....but in the end I want to get where I\\'m going safely so drama isn\\'t what I need.For the performance, I\\'m getting great fuel economy. When in comfort mode my wife can enjoy driving, but there\\'s another car in there waiting to come out when you hit dynamic.I have the mustang brown interior (Canada) with the Monsoon grey exterior and this colour combination is beautiful.Overall, I\\'m very happy. The fm radio of my S4 broke down in 3 month I bought my Audi S4 brand new November 2011.In December 2011,the radiator broke down, after a argument , the dealer agreed to replace the coolant with no charge.Today,march 3, the FM radio broke.There is nothing display on the screen and there is no sound.Yesterday, the screen went blank for about 20 minutes.Then after we turned off the engine, about 1 hour later, when we turned on the engine back, the FM came back to normal.Today we try the same thing but it doesn\\'t work.I am really start to hate this car.I will keep posting everything that will go wrong with my car. S4!  Phantom Black 2012 S4 Prestige edition, 7 speed dual clutch S tronic, quattro, dynamic steering, Audi drive select w/ sports differential, carbon fiber inlays, power sun shades.Beautiful, powerful, dynamic, efficient, all wheel drive, 333 hp, 325 lbs torque, huge trunk, 4 door = perfect car.Sometimes BMW M owners get sad when I drive by :( Made me a believer!! I purchased my first Audi in late 2011, I purchased a 2012 Q5 2.0T, I have driven BMW\\'s exclusively for the last 10 years and I drove the Q5 on advice from a friend that has owned several Audis.Much to my surprise, I was very pleasantly surprised with the drivability and overall build quality of my Audi.After driving the Q5 for about 3 months, I decided I wanted something a little sportier and faster and I drove the S5 convertible as well as the S4 Sedan and fell in love with the S4.I have to say that comparing the S4 to an M3 ( I have owned 3 new ones) the double clutch of the S4 is far superior, it is silky smooth and takes off like a rocket.I could not be more pleased with the car A good alternative to an SUV I own an 4-Runner and a \\'00 Boxster, \\rbut I need another car (Since Boxster\\'s \\rlease is ending shortly, and my mother \\rwants to use the 4-Runner, plus, I am \\rgetting marry soon.)\\rI pick the S4 because:\\r1) Fast, with a Chipped ECU it can get \\ryou over 300 hp and 350 tq/ft\\r2) 4WD, no need to worry about weather\\r3) Rich in features: comes with Bose \\rstereo system, heated and 8-way power \\rseat, glass sun roof, all dim mirrors, \\rroof bike rack, ESP, etc.\\r4) Space is about the same compare to \\rBMW and a bit better then IS300 in \\rterms of cabin and rear trunk space.\\r Compares with 325i Wagon or IS300 \\rWagon, I think this is a better buy ($$ \\rvs features, comfort and power).\\r living with an S4 AVANT I went from an A4 avant to an S4 avant\\rby accident. I visited the dealership to\\rpurchase some touch-up paint for the\\rA4...a friend there asked me If I liked\\rthe S4, to which I replied yes except\\rfor the shift linkage. He tossed me the\\rkeys to an S4 AVANT Tip and said \"go\\rdrive this for a while\" well after an\\rhour I ended up with a new car! It has\\rbeen flawless for me and is great fun to\\rdrive. most people dont realize that a\\rlittle eurpoean stationwagon can turn in\\ra sub 6 second 0-60 time. It performs\\rflawlessly in daily city driving as well\\ras extended road trips. If it has a flaw\\rit would be that at 120 mph you feel\\rlike you are doing 60. I LOVE this car! S4 This car iz so wonderful to drive, a \\rlot od power, stabability, control and \\rit can be compared with almost any car \\rfrom the M3 and down, the new one will \\rbe a great competition with the m5. performance machine tremendous acceleration when you hit \\rit, can carry the groceries, bikes, \\rkayaks, and get through snow with \\rease.  and all around great performer \\rthan is fun to drive.  Opt for the \\rstandard six spped which is smooth as \\rsilk. No Compromise I\\'ve had this rocket sled for just  It Kicks Amazing car!  Extreemly tuneable engine. Not as high performance as an M but much more practicle and accessable. I hate loving it so much :( I bought the car at a 100k miles 3 years ago as my second car at the age of 19. I didn\\'t even know what it was until I found it online and did more research. Coming from a 2011 VW GTI with DSG, I figured I was getting in another 1.8/2.0T VAG product. Little did I know, it has a 2.7L V6 with twin K03 turbos. Mine was a well maintained one owner car with the Tiptronic transmission. Reliability? HAHAHAHA what a joke. I have the most random and smallest issues to fix. And as annoying and expensive as this car is, the feeling it delivers with the turn of the key, irreplaceable. It has a 145k miles now and I have done routine service and I would not hesitate to drive it cross country. Quattro? Pulled up a 3800lbs. 90\\'s Lexus SC400 with a welded rear diff up and STEEP incline with two uneven cracked strips of frozen pavement like it was a feather. And pulled a 4x4 Ram 1500 out of mud. All while being slammed to the ground on H&R springs and blown shocks. Transmission is limiting and will be the ONLY reason I sell this car. I want a 6spd. so I can upgrade turbos but even with an APR Stage 1 tune and a Borla catback, this car pulls and through the entire rpm range. Constant power delivery and complete sleeper. And the sound it makes.......absolutely phenomenal. The interior is incredibly simple yet so elegant in its own way. Every  bit of it feels heavy to the touch with a quality finish. Exterior has the timeless design that still fits in today with modern cars on the road. Will I buy this car again? Absolutely, when I\\'m not a college student. UPDATE: now at 173k been leaking coolant since before I posted this and still runs strong. Took a hit to the passenger side in a wreck and walked away without even wiplash. Will never buy anything but German. Puts a smile on your face every time you drive it I bought this car about 7 months ago and I have loved every minute of it. The car sticks to the road around turns and has that awesome acceleration! It is so responsive that it feels almost like a go kart. A lot of people talk about how expensive the repairs are on this car, which is true. My oil pan cracked about a month ago. The dealership charged about $1,000 to replace the oil pan, and replace the cam shaft tensioner valves. I am a car enthusiast, so in my eyes this car is worth the extra money for repairs. As some say you have to pay to play! Won\\'t be buying another one. I bought this car used in 2004 for an independent dealer.  This car is a lot of fun to drive and handles great.  Gas mileage sucks, but it\\'s a twin tubo V6 with AWD so what do you expect.  Past the fun to drive part I am really disappointed with the car.  After 100K miles it has completely fallen apart.  If Audi wants to claim to be a great reliable car they need to go back to the drawing board.    Since October 09 to January 10 I have put over 3,500 in to the car.  Now the O2 sensors (at least two of the four) have gone bad and that will cost me over $400 to get fixed.  It\\'s for sale and I will not be buying another one!  Friends of mine are about to sell there A4 for the same reasons. German Engineering at its finest  Purchased my S4 used with 30k and it ran like a champ right off the dealership lot! Love the QUATTRO engineering. This car is a bona fide pocket rocket.  Handles corners extremely well, firm tight suspension and great acceleration. Only wish I had gotten a 6 speed instead of the automatic. The S line should stand for super. Audi has done it right again with the S4.   What\\'s not to like? I have had this car only a few months. Love spending every second in it. Sounds and handles great even in stock. This is the only car I\\'ve ever wanted, more than any BMW or Audi. The B5 S4 is truely a work of art and probably has the best engine ever made. Nothing compares to the 2.7TT when it comes time to do upgrades. There is so much potential with this car that no other audi except the A6 2.7tt can offer. This engine can handle 400awhp without making any kind of mechanical upgrades to rods or pistons.The Euro RS4 comes stock with k04s and 380hp on the same engine. When Audi made this car they tried everything they could to limit this engine. Once you unleash it, you wont be dissapointed. The best overall car I have ever owned This car is absolutely perfect. Though My wife made me opt for the tiptronic rather than the 6 speed, this car is still a blast to drive. You can really feel the autobahn engineering. It gives you a planted feel regardless of speed or driving conditions. I ski 15 to 20 times a winter and I have never had a problem taking this up the mountain. Quattro is excellent in the snow. Before this I had a Mercedes ML320 SUV, and I would take the audi any day. No regrets on my purchase. The biggest problem that I have had is that the stereo stopped working and had to be replaced, and I understand that this is a common issue in these cars. Love my S4 This car is fun to drive, plenty of acceleration.  Great in the snow, and better than expected MPG for a V6 Turbo. Great Everyday Fun I was looking at replacing my 3 series BMW when a dealer friend suggested that I would get more car for my money with an Audi S4.  Boy, was he correct.  I\\'ve driven the car almost daily for over 5 years and it is always fun to get behind the wheel.  I\\'ve had no major repairs and it\\'s always a kick when I engage the turbos.  I\\'ve taken long trips and the seating is comfortable and the trunk space very adequate.    Too Much Fun! After a long search I have finally found an Audi S4. So far all I can say is wow! Compared to my BMW M3, the Audi is so refined. The clutch and shifter work well. The brakes are fantastic. Overall styling and finish are top notch. The Bose sound system is tight. The xenon lights are great at night and so is the moonroof. I am so impressed every time I drive the car.  Love at first drive! I fell in love with this car the first time I test drove it.  It has awesome performance as well as a nice ride - you just feel good when you drive this car!  Sometimes, though, love comes at a stiff price.  4 months after my warranty expired, the car required $2,000 in repairs - described as \"normal wear & tear\" items.  8 months later I\\'ve dropped another $2,500 to have \"routine\" items repaired.  I\\'ve never had this much go wrong with a car!!!  I have too much invested now to walk away, and I do love driving this car...  But, my next car will not be an Audi. Pure fun to drive I purchased this vehicle after a great deal of research and have not been disappointed in an category.  The performance and handling make it fun to drive around town or on the highway and fuel economy has been a bonus averaging in the mid to high twenties.  The service plan recommended by Audi is the only time my vehicle has been in the shop short of annual inspections. Maxumum S4 I\\'ve owned my S4 for the past 3 years \\rand now it\\'s time for a decision \\rbetween a new lease or Buy out.  I \\rdrove the new V8 S4 and even though it \\rseemed more refined in a luxury feel it \\rwas a pretty easy choice to continue on \\rwith my \\'01 S4.  The S4 has been an all \\raround performer, not as confidence \\rinspiring as the Boxster I had \\rprevioiusly but still a real kick to \\rdrive.  I never did chip it but I did \\rdrive one and it\\'s the next step since \\rdeciding not to go with an \\'05.  Lots \\rof aftermarket goodies will keep me \\rhappy for awhile.  The power is great \\ron back roads due to the high torque, \\rnot as great in a drag race.  This car \\ris a real kick when in and out of the \\rthrottle in the twisties. best suv killer ever It does everything great.  Fast, fun, \\rcomfortable.  It \\reven has a big trunk to swallow \\reverything i can throw at it.  I \\rtravel to Lake Tahoe every year and \\rthis thing is unstoppable on winter \\rtires.  Throw it sideways on ice and \\rit is instantly recoverable.  Drove to \\rVegas one winter and the entire \\rhighway was black ice.  350 cars got \\rin accidents.  I was the only car to \\rmake it through the highway.  The Red \\rSea of SUVs parted as they spun into \\rthe ditch as i drove right through the \\rmiddle of them on summer tires.  Not a \\rsingle car on the road the last 15 \\rmiles Great car, love that Turbo whine Abundant power, lots of aftermarket\\rperformance and style additions\\ravailable.  It\\'s a nice stealth sedan,\\rdoesn\\'t draw unwanted attention from the\\rauthorities. Great car for a good price I got this car as an early 18th \\rbirthday present. paid $29k for it \\ronline. This is probably the fastest \\rcar from 0-40 in the world, and i am \\rsaying this b/c you get your max \\rtorque at 1850 RPMs, so off the line \\ryou step on it and go. Since buying \\rthis car, i have dropped about 10k in \\rAPR products and im putting down \\r375HP/400 torque on stock turbos, mind \\ryou that 400 torque comes in at 1850 \\rRPMS. Anyone who gets this car should \\rget the ECU upgrade, because for <1000 \\rdollars you will get approx 70HP/110 \\rTorque. Car handles great w/ stock \\rbrakes, even better w/ brembos. Great \\rall around stock car with loads of \\rpotential to be modified into a \\rsupercar. Twin Turbo Fast fun and practical This car is safe, VERY Fast, handles \\rlike a super car and is Amazing in \\rsnow and rain.   \\r Is it the perfect car.   I have found \\rit to be.    You may also.   \\r  audiS4 kicksbtt total fun, drove it on alcan, awesome \\rwinter car, not good for big family-\\rrear space little tight A Great Auto 5.5 sec to 60mph; the \\'04 S4 with \\r340hp is only 0.1-0.2 sec faster and \\rhas a very harsh ride but a little \\rbetter handling and shifter (but at a \\r$50K price). Winter requires snow \\rtires. Large trunk and full-size spare \\rtire. Owner\\'s manual calls for 0w-30 \\ror 5w-30 oil; the local dealer only \\rcarries 10w-30 so I have to bring my \\rown oil in. Only reliability problem \\rwas a seat heater needing replacement \\rat 49K. Nice Bose needs bass help; the \\rAvant has a subwoofer. Touchy brakes \\rstop quickly. I\\'ve averaged 24.4mpg \\rsince 3/01 - trip computer exaggerates \\rmpg by 10%. I track every fill-up. \\rOver one 10K stretch, the trip \\rcomputer overstated the actual by 2.4 \\rmpg true stealth fast but some turbo lag; almost no one  Total Driving Experience I was looking for a performance \\rvehicle that could carry more than a \\rovernight case, and this is it. It\\'s \\rlooks may not scream speed and \\rhandling, but that is just fine, since \\rthese outstanding features attract the \\rwrong kind of attention.  Balance 1.5 years and 16,000 miles later I \\rstill love this car.  As in life \\rbalance is the key.  The right car for \\ralmost all situations.  Power, subtle \\rgood looks, fun to drive, great \\rhandling, all-wheel drive, 6 speed \\rmanual, comfort, room for 4, large \\rtrunk, fit and finish, exclusivity etc. Fun, but should be better The car looks wonderful, inside and \\rout.  Build quality is excellent.\\r Performance with the Tiptronic and with \\rno chip mods is fast, but not wickedly \\rfast.\\r In city driving, I am getting from 19 \\rto 21 mpg and I have reached a steady \\r28-30 mpg on 70mph freeways (you can \\rget 32+ mpg if you choose to drive \\r60mph in the right lane with the \\rtrucks).\\r It is a heavy car (~3500 pounds), but \\rthat is to be expected in an all-wheel \\rdrive vehicle. None better!!! I looked high and low (BMW330, MB320, \\rAcura TL-S, Infiniti G35) for the \\rultimate sports sedan and the S4 was \\rthe only car I found without a \\rweakness.  The 6-speed makes drving fun \\ragain and the car\\'s ability to blend \\rjust the right amounts of performance \\rand comfort puts a smile on my face \\revery time I get in.  It\\'s the first \\rcar I\\'ve owned where I look for excuses \\rto take the long way home. Awesome drive An unpretentious, fabulous drive. A \\rsports car that can still fit the \\rfamily. I think I have ruined myself... I test drove some other cars this \\rweekend, how will I ever be content to \\rsay nothing of happy with anything that \\rdoesn\\'t perform like my S4?  It does \\reverything a car should.  I even get \\rbetween 26-27 mpg on the highway- which \\ris were I drive it the most.  I love \\rthe fact that it is exotic without \\rhaving to try.  I have alcantara \\rseating, I get WOW\\'s everyweek!  The \\rhardest part about owning this car, is \\robeying the speed limit.  If you can, \\rget one.  You will not be \\rdisappointed.  Oh yeah-- In a couple \\ryears, when my warranty is up- CAN YOU \\rSAY 500 HP !  What a great idea ! Fun to drive but not fun to own The car is fast and very fun to drive.  \\rThe large trunk allows me to use it \\rlike a truck.  Although, my experience \\rwith the car has been going down hill \\rsince I drove it off the lot.  With \\rless than 30k miles it is already \\rmaking \"creaking\" noises in the cabin.  \\rThe radio has already been replaced b/c \\rof failure.  I have the 6M tranny and \\rthe clutch has already failed \\r(requiring the car to be in the shop \\rfor 2 weeks).  Immediately after that \\rit went back into the shop for a week \\rfor a failed thermostat.  This is the \\rlast Audi I will \\rpurchase.  I plan to sell it before the \\rwarranty expires. Phenominal car I purchased a 2001 S4 about 2 months \\rago with 7K miles.  It is the automatic \\rw/ tiptronic.  I wanted to purchase the \\rmanual but with a lot of city driving \\rand myself being 6 feet 5 inches it is \\rhard to shift. I test drove the BMW \\r330i, volvo s70, ssab 93 viggen and \\rnone of them compared to the S4.  This \\rcar handles great and the acceleration \\roff of the twin turbo\\'s is second to \\rnone. Extremely Happy Owner (1.5 Years) I thought I\\'d contribute this review \\rafter 1.5 years of ownership and 17,000 \\rmiles.  I still love this car.  It has \\rbeen reliable and continues to thrill. Great car! I\\'ve been the proud owner for more than \\ra year now.  With an added performance \\rchip and new air filter, I\\'m up to \\r310HP (above the stock 250).  An \\runbelievable increase in power - worth \\revery penny.  The car rides great, \\rhandles well, but in need of escaping \\rthe A4 look.  2003 should be a nice \\rchange. Still in love This car has smooth power delivery and  Fun ride This is the fastest car I\\'ve driven.  \\rNot only is this car fast, but it \\rcorners on a dime.  I\\'d be willing to \\rbet you could take almost any car on a \\rwet road around corners.  I knew this \\rwas a nice car, but had no idea of the \\rcraftmenship until I started driving.  \\rLike most people, I wanted a safe, \\rreliable, fast, good mileage AWD \\rvehicle.  This was my number one choice \\rafter driving the X-Type and 330XI.  \\rThe price was cheaper and I\\'ll be \\rhonest it out performed it\\'s \\rcompetition. 2001 Audi S4 This is a very special and unique car \\rto own.  It is a Porsche fighter \\rwithout a doubt, yet rather stealty \\rand you can bring friends along.  It \\ris the biggest German bang for the \\rbuck.  The cars that are comparable \\r(M3, CLK55, C32) start at $10,000 more \\rand go up rapidly from there.  It is \\rquick in a straight line, yet very \\rcomfortable and compliant. The All Around Driving Machine The Audi S4 provides nearly everything anyone could ask for in a car.  High performance, luxury, sedan/wagon utility, all wheel drive/all weather performance all for what truly is not a bad price especially compared to the BMW and Mercedes competition.  Its been incredible driving this car everyday.  Everyone should be lucky enough to own one of these great cars.  And this is before tuning.  With a couple of reasonably priced modifications you can take on any new M3.  If you have the chance to get anS4 I highly recommend you do! Police makes driving less enjoyable The car is all the more fun to drive at night.  It owns the road with a force but yet provides an element of safety.  The command of the car allow for speeding in a safe way.  I see the enormous rush to purchase a SUV but I those things are a drag to drive and unsafe when it comes to quick responses. Gas mileage is poor and is the only buyers remorse I have. Objects may not be as they appear! Not your tire-spinner, but an elegant sport car that can accommodate  a young family because of back seats. A throaty V8 makes it sound like a Corvette is coming,  but when people see an Audi....there shocked. Time to debunk the Audi S4! Time to debunk some myths about this car that previous owners seem starstruck over1/ The engine....well yes its ok but thats it, after all 340hp in a 3700lb body is NOT going to set the world on fire! For comparison the then new C5 vette in 1997 made 345hp and weighed 3400lb. So WHY does the S4 feel so lively?Very simple, its all in the gearing!It is running the equivalent of a 4.11 final drive which as any gearhead knows will give you blinding acceleration and instant thrust through the gears at the expense of fuel economy. Which brings me to..2. Fuel economy...TBH I do not find it to be awful, I average 19-20mpg and given the facts on the gearing is about right. Now if we were to swap the gearing to similar to a 1997 vette came with( 2.87, 3.23 or 3.42 if memory serves) you would see a large increase in average mpg, probably 5 to 6 mpg more. But then your highly rewarding impetus would be diminshed, oh well.Please do not get me wrong, I am NOT critical of the car at all, but it is not a miracle motor some claim, just a good old fashioned combination of sound engineering and gearing.Moreover Audi are to be praised for having the corporate balls to build this the way they did although in the mid 2000,s the economic rug if you like had not been pulled out from under the vast majority of Americans.Drive and enjoy, prepare for high maintenance cost and so so fuel economy. The Ultimate Compromise I drove both new and used BMW\\'s and Mercedes before I picked my 5-year-old S4 Cabrio.  Haven\\'t regretted my choice for a second.  I think of this car as the \"ultimate compromise.\" You can speed top-down through the sweepers of Big Sur in Summer or tackle the hills at Tahoe in the winter.  You can hoon it like a teenager, or ferry the kids to grandma\\'s in safety and comfort.  And oh, the engine!  It\\'s the finest engine I\\'ve ever owned - power and torque and an understated rumble.  It\\'s hard to say how this car could be improved.  A hint: the 2005 tends to be ~$10k cheaper than face-lifted 06-09 models, even though it\\'s almost exactly identical under the skin. excellent car Fantastic engine performance. Very well built interior finishes. High quality. Excellent grip with 4wd. A pleasure to drive. You feel safe and enjoy high performance. I enjoy driving on s mode gear. A fan choice if you are looking for a used sports performance car, without looking like one. All Around Winner I traded in my 350z for a beautiful red S4 cabrio with gray interior and black top. It felt a bit heavy at first after driving a sports car for so long but I quickly fell in love with the smooth ride and roomy, well appointed interior. The big car feel and rumbling V8 almost makes it seem like a 60s era muscle car, especially when cruising city streets at low speeds with the top down.  It is also quite practical with a full sized trunk (with top up) and decent sized back seats, making it perfect for a long weekend of road tripping in the country. My wife and both of my parents all fit comfortably for short trips. In short, a well rounded combination of style, luxury, and performance.    Love it!! I have had my S4 Convertible for about a year and a half and love it!  I can\\'t tell you how many people have commented on my \"cool car\".  The car is insane around corners and I have beaten Porche Boxters on regular occasions in \"races\".  The car almost keeps up with my business partners BMW M3.  I have an automatic and there is a little \"lag time\" when you step on the gas, but once it gets moving, it moves like crazy! 8cyl/4 season/ 2+2 convertible to beat The most reasonably priced 8cyl/4wd/4 season 2+2 convertible for snow covered Northeast states; there is no other convertible in this class that can claim this.  Excellent fit and finish by coach builders from Karmann, Germany. This car is almost like a hand made jewel for this price range.   Can we go topless? I bought this car in late 2004 and after a year and half, I figured I could finally do a complete review of it.  I cross-shopped and found the S4 cab was best all-around.  Up to 80 mph, the wind noise with the open top is astonishingly low - the best of any convertible I\\'ve ever been in.  The handling is superb for a convertible, but remember it is a front-heavy AWD vehicle, so drive it correctly or helloooo scary understeer - learned this at an Audi Club driving event.  When done right, it\\'s awesome through the twisties.  Overall, this is a grown-up, amazing sleeper of a cruiser. Nearly Flawless S4 Cabrio is the most satisfactory car I\\'ve ever owned- it has luxury, stlye, performance, speed, and subtle class like no other convertible on the road. The V8 is creamy smooth, and the 6-Speed auto, although not as good as the DSG in my daughter\\'s A3, is wonderful in Sport mode. Interior/exterior are both beautifully made and beautiful to look at- typical Audi.  This car is worth your money and your time, and it\\'s more of an extremely fast luxo-cruiser than a sports car- this is a good thing. Instant Fun.......Just Add Me! I bought this vehicle new as an \\'05 leftover.  I can truly say this is the most fun car I\\'ve ever driven.  I never thought anything on four wheels could be more fun than my \\'99 Prelude, but this is like a Prelude on steroids!  I love the slightly lower- key styling (no fins, spoilers, etc.) and the aural excitement from that V- 8.  Handling and performance are both superb.  I\\'ve seen many mentions of this car\\'s low gas mileage, but I\\'ve been averaging about 23-24 mpg.  The main downside so far is that the generally beat-up streets of Baltimore City are eating my tires at an insane rate (not really a fault of the vehicle, though).  For a car this spirited and fun, however, it\\'s worth it! Awesome The Audi S4 Cab has beautiful leather interior with a highly functional cabin and a beautifully designed exterior; top quality paint and materials. The S4\\'s 340hp V8 is super responsive and hums like a song. Handling is superb; the ride is solid. Top down with Bose audio system entertainment, the S4 is a dream come true! Highly recommended I Love This Car I have had so many compliments on this car.  I\\'ve been stopped in parking lots with people asking me about it because it looks so good. And it drives equally well.  The backseat has room for 2. It\\'s much roomier and more comfortable than any other convertible we\\'ve seen.  I\\'ve never been much  of a \\'car person\\', but I LOVE THIS CAR! My Electric  Blue Beach Buggy The Audi S4 Quattro soft-top is a beautifully manufactured machine. I think that the degree of attention to detail; both fom both an ergonomic and design standpoint are about the best in the business. I have owned Mercedes Benz, Porsches, including a Turbo Carrera, a 1987 Maserati Quattroporte, GTO, Morgan +4, BMW Z3, but this Audi SA Cabriolet is the most \"together\" car I have ever owned.  The 335HP V-8 coupled with the smooth 6 speed shifter is a joy.  Sure, not Ferrari fast, but driving in Los Angeles is more about responsive on-tap acceleration and Quattro manuverability. The electric covertible top is a piece of enginneering beauty. Drop Top Fun Bought my 2005 Audi S4 quattro Cabriolet over a 2005 Chevrolet Corvette Convertible, 2005 Mercedes-Benz CLK 500, and 2005 BMW M3 Convertible. After a brief test drive, my wife and I were both very excited about this car. It had the leg and headroom I need (I\\'m 6\\'5\"), as well as the comfort and convienience my wife wanted. The performance is great in S mode, very laid back in Drive (the Corvette is much faster).  The handling is great (equal to the Corvette and BMW, better than Mercedes). This car\\'s fit and finish are wonderful.  The navigation system is the best I\\'ve used. I have not been this excited about a car in a very long time. I can even live with the low fuel economy.  S4 Cabriolet My 2005 Audi S4 Cabriolet is a total rocket!  It was clearly built to appeal to men and it delivers with ease.  I found the car more appealing than the BMW M3 Convertible.  I particularly love the sound of the 340 horsepower V8 engine and the great 6 speed stick transmition.  It has all the bells and whistles a luxury car should have.  The electric top goes up or down in a flash.  This is the most fun car I\\'ve owned. Gotta love that torque at 3,500 RPM My 2005 Audi S4 Cabriolet is my third Audi to date. I used to be a BMW fanatic, but after I test drove my first A4 2.8 Quattro, I just had to trade in my BMW 325iC -- and I never looked back.  I have considered the S4 for quite some time. So I said enough with the \\'considering\\' and it was time I got into one. I\\'m more than glad I did! What a fun car to drive. It has excellent handling, like every Quattro model, enough power, and that V8 engine feels light. It has great smooth lines.  It doesn\\'t look intimidating, but yet its looks can be deceiving because of what\\'s under the hood. The bad stuff -- as always, there is not a whole lot of room in the back. But for now, my 5-year old daughter loves it with the top down, and so do I! Simply Gorgeous Easily the best car I\\'ve ever owned, the S4 Cabriolet is just beautiful. Its exhaust sound is creamy smooth, it has a much nicer a sound than my outgoing A6 2.7T. Its interior is perfect, the only flaw being that the rear seat armrests are a little intruding. Otherwise, it\\'s a very comfortable convertible. It\\'s a much better value than a BMW M3 Convertible, which doesn\\'t even have power seats standard, and a much much better value than the Mercedes-Benz CLK 55, which is $85,000. The S4, almost fully- loaded, is around $60,600. I love it more than any other car. Elegant, yet pugnacious A beautiful car that can blow a 645 off the line. Okay, maybe it can\\'t beat an M3 off the line but in my opinion it\\'s better looking, you get AWD, it has an automatic for traffic and pedals when you want to shift manually, a much sweeter exhaust sound...not to menton a much better ride. My 911 has sat in the garage since I bought the S4.The only bummer is the gas mileage. pros and cons of S4 convertible A fun car to drive. The quattro is awesome and adds much performance. This car is as much fun in snow as it is with the top down in summer. Great handling in ALL weather conditions. I think that Audi is improving its customer service but it is not yet as good as Lexus or Mercedes. You will need to soon replace the standard performance tires that come with the car. I recommend getting all weather tires to rotate onto the car in winter for both performance and economy. Tiny trunk if you put the top down. The cars interior has very little storage. The drink holders are awful; expect a spill. Tiny rear seat; not comfortable for adult. However, overall, I like the car, drives great, and it is fun! Creamy Smooth... Perfect! The S4 Cabriolet is the most beautiful convertible on the road, to the elegant eye. It is sooo creamy and smooth, that I just want to rev the engine in neutral. It is so beautiful, it sounds like an automotive sonatra. Physically, it is beautiful from every angle, inside and out. And it is satisfyingly fast and dominant on the freeway, with the ladie\\'s hair flowing out of it. It makes others jealous to see such a perfect convertible. Love it, except for gas mileage! great car I recommend it! Powerful, responsive, attractive, interior is nicely appointed. The quality of the parts and appointments is high. Not surprisingly, a gas guzzler. The upgraded stereo and satellite radio system is a nice addition the best The best handling car I have ever driven.  The powertrain let\\'s you do anything you want.  At 2,000 miles the engine really opens up and becomes even more impressive.  The adaptive transmission in the automatic really adapts to how you are driving, hit the gas and you\\'re gone.  I found a little hesitation of the line, but if you put it in sport mode and turn off the esp traction control, it more than solves the problem.  With the top down the stereo adapts with road noise and is a lot of fun.  The three layered top sounds as quite as a coupe with the top up.  The two doors make it difficult to fit 4, but I don\\'t have to ride back there so I don\\'t care.  The car is worth it!!!!!!! S4 Crazy We were so excited when we got our new \\rS4, we almost jumped for joy! It\\'s a \\rbeautiful, luxurious performance \\rcabriolet, and it\\'s cheaper than an M3 \\rconvertible and waaaaaaaay cheaper than \\ra CLK55 AMG cabriolet. And, it has the \\rbullet-proof quattro! Audi S4 I have owned this car now for six \\rmonths. No problems so far with the \\rexception of the wind-blocker\\'s design -\\r very flimsy retaining clips. The \\rengine is superb - too bad that the car \\ris way too heavy, detracting from the \\rperformance. The poor fuel economy is \\rdue the weight as well. Nevertheless I \\ram amazed that I could not think of any \\rserious complaint about the car so far. \\rI will have to get winter tires/rims \\rfor it and at 1300+ they are not cheap \\rbut they are essential for winter \\rmobility. Would I buy the car again? In \\ra heartbeat. I bought it not knowing what it needed... Let me start this review by saying wow. This car is literally awesome and every ounce of performance and style is there. I\\'m 6\\'6\" and with the seat all the way back lol i have great leg and head room in my avant. I think the design is honestly pretty poor on the interior side because when i have my seat back all the way and the passenger is getting comfortable with the seat but not all the way back. The back seats literally have no leg room. I think if they had given just 4 inches of the back seats and moved them back about 4\" it would be fine. The trunk is still huge anyway. I bought it as my first car at 17 years old, i know now that I\\'ve bought a gem and i love the car extremely. I bought it with minor cosmetic problems but i knew that when i bought it for a steal. So far since I\\'ve had it, I\\'ve driven it for 6 fun-filled and gas guzzled days and then it broke. It was leaking anti freeze and had almost no oil in it, had in known that before i made the purchase, id own a sedan s4. Even with that, i love the avant and would never trade it for a sedan ever. Never ever. Im already rebuilding the entire engine so hopefully after this the car is in mint condition which it should be and ill drive it till the wheels fall off. This Thing Rips Amazing all around package.  Perfect compromise for those who need cargo space and the ability to blow the doors off anything with a Hemi.  I ski a lot, and once the snow tires are on, there is no better, or faster, way to the mountains.  Also, nobody does better interiors than Audi.  Top-notch materials, easy to operate, and everything right where it should be.  It\\'s great when in a car this fast you don\\'t have to take your eyes off the road to turn down the stereo. lil\\' woody on rails This car rips! After one year, have not found handling limits yet. V8 not torquey in muscle car style but really screams towards redline. Throw your bike or skis in the back and go carve up (and down) a canyon. Bose stereo took quite a while to break in but worth the wait. Where else can you get this level of performance and a stick w this level of practicality?   M3 beater BMW\\'s M3 really is a phenominal car; quick, solid and good looking, but how many do you see around. The S4 is understated and, for an estate, very attractive. Straight line the BMW will win, driving entertainment and again the M3 pips the Audi to the post but for sheer aural entertainment nothing can beat a V8 (except a V10). Not only that, but Audi\\'s Quattro system means that 344PS is avaiable come rain or shine an awesomely inspiring piece of German engineering - next time Audi, a little rear bias on the Quattro and that sacrifice in grip will be more than made up for in driving entertainment. good car so far only one problem as the diagnostics computer had to be replaced after continious check engine light malfunctions.  Totally solid in the rain and any other driving condition.  She loves to drink, but i suppose one should be able to afford the fuel if they can afford the car.   Audi S4 review I have had an interesting experience with my leased 2005 S4 Avant.  After one day with the car I noticed a large oil leak under it.  To make a long story short, the car had a bad gasket, my dealer repaired the problem and Audi of America compensated me for the headache. Otherwise the car has been a joy todrive and I love this vehicle.  This Car is Awesome  I bought my Audi S4 about a month ago.  So far its been a totally awesome car. The car is absolutely perfect so far (knock on wood) and I can\\'t seem to stop driving it. The build quality and attention to detail is amazing. The car is so solid its built like a brick. Maybe its to early to foercast reliability but so far the car is perfect. And I hope it stays that way :)   Superb All Around Performance Car I have had My Audi S4 for 3 months now and have\\rput about 1,600 miles on it.  It has\\rexceeded my high expectations.  Any\\rconcerns I had about reliability issues\\rbased on early \\'04 reports are\\rcompletely gone as I\\'ve had no problems\\rat all.  This is a superb vehicle for those who want a\\rtrue very high performance car (faster\\raround the track than an M3 in some\\rmagazine reports), but also want true\\rpracticality and comfort as well.  This\\rprovides virtually the best of all\\rpossible worlds with almost no\\rcompromises in performance or comfort. Sleeper wagon This is my second S4 (also have a 2000 Quattro Delight I have a 2005 and while we have only had it  My 2005 S4 Avant I got my S4 Avant about 6weeks now with \\r1500miles on the clock... Very happy \\rwith my decision, Got AWD, 4doors with \\ra wagon, 340HP and a set of RECARO \\rseats!  \\r Updated review of my 2005 S4 I previously wrote a review on my car at about 70k miles and she was still an awesome car (I bought her used in 2007 with 28k miles). I say still because at about 84k miles my timing tensioners started to fail and my timing chain had the infamous rattle at start up. At first, not a big deal, but the check engine light came on and the rattle became worse and worse. I knew the repairs would cost thousands, so I had to get rid of her. It was bitter sweet because I got a new S4, but I miss the V8. The suspension isn\\'t meant for bad roads, so beware of suspension work if you live in a city of anywhere the roads aren\\'t great. That was several thousand $$$ too.  Don\\'t buy, unless you have money to burn This car is so much fun to drive, I love it!However, now that my car, bought new, has 75k miles on it, I would be happy to get rid of it and never buy Audi again. Since I first bought it there have been problems, but when you add them all up, they are outrageous!The original top failed during a rainstorm ,causing the car to flood.Spent $9k replacing the control panel and rewiring the car. The new top hasn\\'t worked for a year, Audi USA is involved now but still no satisfactory resolution. The starter broke, the car fan wouldn\\'t shut off, draining the battery until I needed a tow to get repaired, so many other! Excellent car for the money I\\'ve owned my 2005 S4 since 2007 (bought used off lease at 24k miles) and it has been a great car. It is a lot of fun to drive with lots of torque and great V8 growl. Living in the city, I buy cheap tires (nails, etc.) and they still do great with cornering. I\\'ve had it at top speed (155 mph) and it was surprisingly smooth, although the revs were really high. Don\\'t expect good gas mileage, but that\\'s not why you buy thus car. It still looks sexy and I get compliments with a car that is almost hitting it\\'s 8th birthday. I test drove the new S4 (2013) and it just wasn\\'t the same. I have no idea what to get next! The best car for a smart man I\\'ve owned my S4 for over 30k miles now, so I think I can properly review it as a used car.  It\\'s a blast to drive if you drive it like it wants to be driven. You honestly have to take care to drive it slowly.  I commute 3 hours round trip to DC everyday and while I hate my commute, if I just stomp on the gas in 3rd gear at 3k revs, it makes you smile like a teenager watching American Pie during a certain scene.  Gun it in first and you almost feel uncomfortable.  It throws you back and takes some getting used to.  I typically drive conservatively, but if you downshift in this car and hear the growl, it just makes you smile.  I give my car to my wife when I\\'m out of town, and it scares her. If I could marry this car, I would! I bought this car when I was home on R&R leave from Afghanistan back in February.  I had been researching the A4 for about 7 months and had every intention of buying that once I got to the dealership.  As the Carmax dealer was walking me to the A4\\'s I saw my knight in shining armor out of the corner of my eye.  The girl opened the driver\\'s side door and I was sold.  I didn\\'t even test drive the thing, and it was a manual so I had to teach myself, but trust me it was WELL worth it.  I took a look at the A4\\'s once I was done drooling over my soon-to-be new car and there was absolutely no comparison; the A4 looked like a grandma car compared to what I was about to roll home in! BEWARE!! Caught on fire in my driveway!  I loved my Audi. I really did. I had no complaints to speak of. It was flawless with only 20k miles. Unfortunately, it caught fire on its own in the middle of the night. It was an electrical fire originating under the driver\\'s seat. Had the windows been open, the fire would\\'ve been much worse, probably would\\'ve damaged my house. Is there a perfect car?This is may be it Thanks to most of the reviewers here, I made the decision to purchase a used S4 (along with Audi\\'s pure protection additional warranty).  I have to say it is the most amazing car I\\'ve ever owned--even over my 67 Mustang fastback.  As another reviewer said \"it does everything right\".  A pleasure to drive, doesn\\'t look fast but runs like a refined rocket, handles like a track car and is great in snowy terrain of the north west.  Highway MPG is doable, and for those that lament about city MPG, realize it\\'s 340HP w/over 300lb ft torque...in the same engine compartment as the A4 (which I\\'ve owned 1.8t) and also liked. This is like a supermodel love affair in comparison. Gracious, powerful, refined Little monster I purchased the car used from an Audi dealership. I suppose I paid a little more buying the car from an Audi dealer, but the added warranty of purchasing a certified car was well worth the additional cost. The car is a monster. I have had all different types of American performance cars and they are not even in the same category as this car. The performance, handling, and braking are nothing short of phenomenal! Now the downside.  The gas mileage is poor ( 18mpg if you\\'re lucky ). The interior is a little cramped. Look at that, I can only find two negative things to comment about on this car. Great car! Be careful though, if you test drive one you\\'ll be takeing it home. 4-door Porshe I\\'ve had 13 Bmw\\'s, 3 Merc\\'s and 5 Audi\\'s in my life and this car is by far the easiest to love. All cars have weaknesses, but this one is special. The only weakness is a small gas tank and a bad drinking habit. I wear a suit to work and look the part when I pull into my space - I wear jeans and Tim\\'s on the weekends and this car rocks. It\\'s comfortable, quick and fast.  It\\'s heavy, which is a good thing more than bad. I\\'m 40+ so I don\\'t need to race. I just do and this car keeps up just fine. This is the most complete car I have ever owned. It does everything well. This is the complete package. Good Job Audi! 2001 S4 vs. 2005 S4 I swapped my 2001 Audi S4 with an owner of a 2005 S4. I purchased the nogaro blue with two tone blue/black recaro interior seats. This is a beautiful car. Audi did an excellent job with the overall look and feel. The previous owner lowered the vehicle and added awe tuning exhaust and 19\" rims low profile. The exhaust is sick and the car certainly turns a lot heads as well as comments from envious VW owners. Audi is welcomed to the muscle car category!  I will say that I miss the bi-turbo of my 2001. The bi-turbo is quicker off the line due the turbo and light weight of the V6. However, the overall torque is something to be desired in the V8.   S4 vs M3 - different animals I\\'m going to write something radical here. The Audi S4 should not be compared to the BMW M3. They are different and serve different purposes. I had an M3 and now an M5. I can speak to this: S4 - better family car. Better in weather. More comfortable. M3 handles better, faster. Both are solid built and of strong engine. Audi is a better value, but doesn\\'t hold its value as well. AWD is a plus in the Audi, but it still doesnt handle as well as the M3. Reliability - BMW. Comfort Audi, Interior/Exterior - Audi, Fuel - BMW, Both are equal in the other categories. Summary, Audi for value and BMW for reliability.  BMWs have become over produced and value watered down. From \\'97 A8 to \\'05 S4 I just traded in my \\'97 A8 and never looked back. The A8 also had the 4.2 V8, but it a slug compared to this better aspirated version. A V8 as it is supposed to be.  340 HP mated to the road with precision and grace. The cabin is ergonomic and smart. Bucket seats are comforable for long distance, and keep you snug through the high speed curves. The controls all make sense and are exactly where they should be. The exterior design is stealth, a this car looks like an A4, but drives like the German sport car it is. Indeed a \"Wolf in sheeps clothing\"  My wife even called it cute until she heard the rumble of the V8.  This car sounds like a beast when it growls.   Very cool Even after 3.5 years and 44.5k miles, my recent purchase of a used 2005 S4 is a fantastic drive. The look and performance is awesome. I love the acceleration, braking, handling, and sound of this \"tiger in sedan\\'s clothing\". It provides just the right amount of sedan for my business use, but allows me to have a blast driving down the coastal highway 1 setting top pace for all the \"weekend sport cars\". 05.5 S4 4dr aka\"D BEAST!\" I have owned my B7(chassis designation) S4 for 1.5yrs. now and love it. Build quality and fit and finish are second to none. The nav, XM radio and Bose sound systems are exellent. Im so pleased with the handling of this car, that its the first vehicle i\\'ve ever owened that i have\\'nt made any mods to the suspension. I have however added aftermarket intake,exhaust and software upgrades. Which go a long way in remeding one of the S4\\'s few faults weight!.At a curb weight of 3902lbs with the 6spd tiptronic,you won\\'t win many drag races against worthy opponents. My best friend owns a 05 comp pkg BMW M3 SMG, and even he grudgingly admits the S4\\'s handling and overall performance makes it a superior car Love my car I have to say that I really love this car.  I now have 35K miles on it and it is as good as the day I bought it.  When I purchased it, there wasn\\'t an RS4 yet. Otherwise I would have bought that.  But at this price point, I think it is one of the best cars in the world.  Due to inclement weather I sold my previous sports cars, a BMW M3 and a Mazda RX8.  While the BMW was spectacular, it just didn\\'t work in the snow.  At all.  The RX8 was a dud all around.  It was fun to shift, but that was it.  It was slow, could not be driven in snow, and it stalled and needed to be towed constantly. The s4 is quick, handles great in snow, & is a perfect wolf in sheep\\'s clothing.  I highly recommend it. Best Car - Even if it\\'s Thirsty By far the best car I\\'ve ever owned, and I\\'ve had a bunch.  Drives like a four door Porsche C4.  I get bored quickly with cars, but every time I get in the S4 it feels like I\\'ve been given a gift.  If you are a car enthusiast, you simply can\\'t have a bad time in this car.  You pay for the V-8 when you fill up (you can use regular, though), but you\\'re more than equally rewarded when you step on the accelerator. Wow Wow, what a machine.  I upgraded from a Volkswagen GTI to this and this car is light years ahead of anything else I\\'ve ever driven.  The AWD is flawless, the Recaro leather seats hold you in, and the quality of the interior is second to none.  My only gripe about this car is the awful gas mileage. Fantastic! Honestly, it\\x92s too early for me to objectively rate all the characteristics.  It\\x92s SO much fun to drive - rain or shine.  The engine is a beast and roars like a race car . . . people stare and frequently someone will ask what I\\x92m driving.  I love all the amenities \\x96 Recaro seats, Bose, NAV, XM, etc., etc.  The ride is awesome and handling is second to none. My biggest criticism is that city gas mileage is poor (though comparable or better than a big truck or SUV).   The best car ever in my opinion I have owned Jensen Healey, x2 Jaquars, x3 BMW incl a 2003 M3 roadster, x3Mercedes, a Volvo and a couple domestics. This is the best of the bunch for fun, comfort, driving ease @ all speeds and slick in all respects. And a bargain price for all that. I was on the list for a BMW M5 and luckily took this out for a test drive!!  Complete Package Has 4 wheel drive, power, good visibility, and not too many other S4\\'s on the road.  After a year I\\'m coming up on the one year anniversary with my 2005 S4 B6 Sedan QM and don\\'t regret it one bit. I drove a 2004 Audi A4 1.8TQM previously and the few minor complaints I had with it are gone in the S4. The power is awesome, handling is crisp, loves the mountain roads and the freeways equally. It\\'s a little soft for the racetrack, but the recaro seats grip wonderfully. The Bose sound package is nice, except for the auto volume control-had some annoying issues with that. I\\'m also glad I got in before they change the body style-can\\'t say that I\\'m a fan of the fishmouth grill. So, a year later, I still love the car. I have a smile on my face everytime I go to drive it. Well built and safe. fun to drive I was trying to decide which car to lease, so I test drove BMW 330, Lexus GS430, Infiniti M45 and FX45.  They were all good cars, but for the money and performance the Audi S4 sedan was the best.  For 49K you get the fastest and best handling car with all wheel drive to boot.  Only complaint is small fuel tank and having to switch to snow tires for the winter. GREAT CAR ! Great car, a blast to drive, fit and finish superb. Amazing fuel economy for a v8. will satisfy anyone. AWD is extremely helpful. INCREDIBLE, AWESOME AND TOTAL FUN As a former BMW owner of a 3, 5, and 7 series over the years I approached Audi with caution and curiosity.  The moment I drove the 2005 S4 I was hooked!  The handling, power, style and sheer performance surpassed all other cars I\\'ve owned.  As a Realtor and \\'need\\' for a larger car the small size of the S4 is a compromise, but very much worth it in all respects.  I now enjoy the hours I spend in my car!  Don\\'t think twice... buy this car and you\\'ll never regret it!  drive and you will buy best driving car ever only car that compared was the turbo porche suv. S4 V8 Tiptronic Traded a 2002 S4 with Triptonic; didn\\'t relish giving up the visceral whine of the twin turbos, but the burble of the V8\\'s exhaust is music to my ears. The 2005.5 cost $14,000 more than the 2002; however, it has a lot more content, e.g. Recaro seats to die for, puddle lights, automatic headlights, rain sensing windshield wipers, etc. that makes the price easier to swallow. It is a mature driver\\'s sports sedan, not a frantic M3, or boy racer STI. It is easy to drive fast responsibly. The paddle shifters can be activated while in \"D\" or \"S\" which gives you best of both worlds i.e. fully automatic or Tip. Audi Driver (UK) suggests the tip is faster after launch than the stick version... S4 vs M3 Purchased 2005 old style fascia S4/6M with premium/cold pkg & upgraded stereo. Good fit & finish, raw power throughout the power band, and is a superb performance automobile that any enthusiast would enjoy. Excellent in the snow I purchased my new S4 in November, and with the original performance Dunlop tires, nearly totaled it with the first snowstorm.  New 18 inch Pirelli Snowsports (even though they recommended 17 inches with new rims of course) completely solved the problem with minimal compromise in ride and handling quality. I cross shopped an M3 and CTS-V, but living in the snowbelt, the quattro was the clincher.  Forget the gas guzzler tax and definetely go for the manual transmission.  The dealership even let slip that they\\'ll pay for a new clutch under the scheduled warranty if you accidentally burn the original one out. 2005 Audi S4 Wonderful car, have been driving it for 4 weeks.  I find myself taking the long way home just for fun.  For those who want it all in a car that can be driven year round in the NE, this is it. My 4th Audi My S4 is my fourth Audi, but my first with a big person\\'s engine. Coming from a 2.8 V6 and 2 1.8T fours, the performance of this car is fabulous. I loved the interior on my first 3 Audis and this is a natural evolution. No need to change perfection, they just spiced it up with superb Recaro seats, and carbon fiber(optional) trim. Other than that, it is virtually identical to my 2002 A4 (which is to say, excellent). The exterior is great too, looking much more muscular than the A4, but not so much so that it stands out. This car is a true wolf in sheep\\'s clothing. So far, its quality is consistant with my other Audis, excellent. Excellent Bahnstormer, Minor Flaws A unique car, if you focus more on content than styling.   While the car is plenty handsome, it looks much like the lesser A4 - a car that is some $15k cheaper.   The rims, spoiler and aluminum mirror housings help differentiate it somewhat.  Looking at and touching the leather, wood and excellent plastics is a pleasure.  All controls are precise, well-placed and expensive feeling. I chose this car for its more sporting nature than the A6, the more youthful attitude than the Cadillac CTS, and the extra doors relative to the M3.  To my eye, it is better looking and sportier than the choices from Japan and the US. Finally, at $52K, it is significantly less expensive than V8\\'s from MB or BMW. One sweet ride Wow.  There isn\\'t enough space in this review to dothe 2005 Audi S4 justice.  I was close to purchasing a BMW 330i w/performance package.  At the last minute I decided to look at the S4.   There is no simply no comparison.   The fit and finish of the interior are the superb quality that you would expect from Audi. It\\'s very comfortable, yet the Recaro seats never let you forget you are in a performance car.   Speaking of performance, the acceleration is simply breathtaking, and the handling is very sure-footed, thanks to the quattro.  The exterior styling is classy, with a slightly aggressive edge to it.  This is a perfectly understated sports sedan.  The clincher?  I got a better lease deal on the S4 than the 330i! One sweet ride Wow.

Besides the awsome \\rtraction in all conditions, this car \\rcan handle off roading like a king, \\rwhich I found out by mistake during my \\rjourney to Lake Arrowhead California. \\rThis car is the master of all trades. Monster S4 Extreme acceleration, handling, and comfort.  The S4 has and does it all.  This car leaps off the line, and corners like glue.  The Recaro seats are the most comfortable I have experienced to date.  I love the rumble of the V8 and the way it pulls you into the seats all the way to 7000 rpms.  I didn\\'t expect it to be such a beast and a head turner all wrapped into one complete package.   2005 Audi S4 The Audi S4 is an iron fist in a silk glove. \\rEvery time you hit the right foot it \\rfeels like two hands shoving you \\rforward, and it corners like it\\'s on \\rrails.\\r I took the family allroad 2.7T to the \\rdealer for a service, and test drove \\rthe S4 while I waited.

What a great car? Between this S4, the\\rMercedes C55 AMG, and BMW M3, the S4 is\\rclearly the best. It goes 0-60 in just\\rover 5 seconds, but the best feature is\\rby far its stellar handling. The Quattro\\rdelivers perfection around every turn:\\rthere is NO NEED to brake! The interior\\ris also very stylish and quite\\rcomfortable, while the exterior\\rmaintains the look of a sporty vehicle.\\rEverything is very ergonical (easy to\\ruse) from the radio to the tiptronic\\rtransmission (which is VERY smooth). The\\rtrunk is quite large for its class and\\rcan easily hold several golf bags or\\rpieces of luggage. I love everything\\rabout this car from the most minute\\rdetail to the 340 HP V8 beast under the\\rhood! A++++++! Speed and looks... Awesome car, very fast, great handling. The last car i want to own I have had a number of cars over the years. I have had the small sports car to the suv ... and nothing can compare to the feeling I get in this. From the handling to the roar of the motor ... it is all pleasure. I acutally like driving in the rain now - thanks in part to Quattro. It is the most fun car I have ever driven. A great car with problems !!! I got this car in May 2004.  It\\'s a great, fun car to drive but I have several minor problems but the most important one is, while driving between 900-1100 rpm or when i go down gear, I hear a vibration.  it sounds like coming from the muffler but it doesnt.  Went back to the dealer twice and finally second time, they said that it\\'s coming from the drive chain. Maybe they will have to take the engine out to fix it.  WOW I traded my 2000 s4 twin turbo for this \\rv-8 model and WOW.  It handles great and \\raccelerates great.  I thought they \\rcouldn\\'t improve on the \\'00 model, but was \\rI wrong.  What an upgrade!  Drive this \\rand it sells itself.   Superb Sleeper Sedan ... The S4 goes like a bullet train - has \\rprodigious grip, incredible high speed \\rstability, corners like its on rails, \\rvery fast and linear power delivery. \\rJust like a Subaru WRX STi, but \\rwithout the boy racer image and better \\rbuild quality. Also has low profile \\rlooks - literally re-defines  the \\rterm \"wolf in sheep\\'s clothing\". The \\rS4 also has a true \"Jekyl & Hyde\" \\rcharacter, can be nice one minute and \\ra total beast the next minute. I\\'m \\rstill not sure why anyone would prefer \\ra RWD over an AWD, especially when \\rgrip, stability and handling is \\rimportant to piloting a ultra high \\rperformance sedan/coupe. I can see why \\rFWD is inferior to an AWD/RWD, but RWD \\rto AWD? Best High Performance All Weather Car Upgraded from \\'00 S4 to \\'04 S4 and the \\rcar is absolutely awesome.  Just when I \\rthought they couldn\\'t improve an \\ralready incredible car, they did!  \\rPower and handling are incredible.  The \\rV8 sounds phenomenal.  Recaros are \\rsuperb.  With snow tires, the S4 is \\rjust as awesome in the winter with \\rsnow!  There really is no comparison \\rfor the entire package.  STi is a very \\rdifferent beast and the M3 is only a \\rpart time fun car in the snow belt.  \\rAdd to the fact that you can get this \\rcar in sedan, wagon, or convertible and \\ryou can pick your perfect car to drive \\rall-year round. Ausgezeichneter! I bought this car after erroneously \\rpurchasing an M3 and owning it for 49 \\rdays.  While the BMW is a superb-\\rhandling and braking race car, it is \\rnot liveable for the long haul. It\\'s \\rimpossible to shift smoothly.  Its \\rergonomics are variable, at best fair. \\rThe seat is fair for a tall driver.  \\rThe S4, on the other hand, is a breath \\rof fresh air.  Its controls are \\rlogical  logical and pragmatic.  Its \\rhandling is elegantly sublime, and its \\rpower, the POWER, well, it\\'s \\runbelievable. The shifter carves to \\rperfection. The car has a buttery \\rsmooth feel.  The build quality is far \\rbetter than VW\\'s already excellent mid-\\rpriced siblings.   Unbelievable It\\'s like a cat - can be soft and \\rpurring, can be lightening-quick and \\raggressive. I\\'m still in break-in \\rperiod, so I don\\'t push it to the \\rlimit, but I am yet to hear the wheels \\rspin. The traction matches that of a \\rPanzer.\\r Some people know what \"S4\" means, but \\rmost don\\'t. Imagine faces unsuspecting \\rfriends who test-drive your \"new \\rAudi\" :)) \\r The best all year round car  This is by far the perfect all year \\rround vehicle. The 340hp pulls you \\rcourteosy a 4.2l v8. I came from an 01 \\rs4 to the 05 and there is a dramatic \\rimprovment all throughout. Handling is \\rlike a knife, acceleration is scary, \\rinterior is very smartly designed with \\reverything in easy reach. Seats offer \\rexcellent support and comfort. I have \\rnot one complaint about this amazing \\rmachine.  Great performance and day-to-day driving Been driving for one week and love it.  \\rWill write another review in a few \\rmonths to see if I have changed my \\rmind.  Excellent car so far.  Does not \\rdrive like a A4 or Passat at all.  I \\rhave driven them both.  This car should \\rnot be compared with other high \\rperformance rear-wheel drive cars like \\rit has been (esp. M3), but with other \\rAWD sedans.  I have yet to see one that \\rcould come close to the S4\\'s \\rperformance, yet. amzing s4 This is the absolute best car i have  Pure Performance!!!!! I truly enjoy the experience. The  By far the best car I have owned If you\\'re looking for a car that\\'s \\rmore soul than show, this is the car \\rfor you. It\\'s the best of both world\\'s \\rwhen it comes to comfort and \\rperformance.  The seats are fantastic, \\rthe interior is tight and the drive is \\runbelievable. A pure blast to drive! Awesome! The first day I picked the car up I \\rdrove it from Oregon to California,so \\rI had a chance to test it on the \\rFreeways and Mountain Roads...it \\rexceeded all my expectations...it has \\rpower..it is very stable...the engine \\rsound is terrific...this car can fly!\\rThe German engeneering brings top \\rquality fit and finish far beyond what \\rother car manufacturers  bring to the \\rmarket! \\r Best Car Ever Seriously, I never had a better car than\\rthis Audi... It must be said that\\rnothing compares to German\\rEngeneering... The 4.2litre V8 with 5\\rvalves per cylinder produces so much\\rhorsepower that you are just thrown in\\ryour chair when you touch the pedal... I\\rdrove this Audi, and I drove a Porsche\\rtoo... Both were really fast, but this\\rAudi has more to offer for a lower price\\rso... really, If you\\'re looking for a\\rbeautiful family car that drives like a\\rFerrari, the Audi S4 is your best buy! Amazing I\\'ve had the S4 for just over a month \\rnow, and it has far exceeded my \\rexpectations.  Great engine sound, \\rpower.  Build quality and interior fit \\r& finish are top notch. larger sport sedan this car is closer in size to e class Mercedes and 5 series bmw.shop against these cars and not c class mb and 3 series bmw.much better then e class and 5 series for far less money. A joy to drive! As advised by Edmunds, going with Premium Plus and adding Technology package and S Sport Package seemed to be the best value. Coming from 21 years of driving BMWs, I was doing a lot of research on why change. But with technology platforms changing so fast, I wanted to keep an open mind. It was a surprise that Audi S4 came out on top for me after two test drives and a lot of research. Interior, Exterior, performance, and driving comfort. Now, after 4 months of daily driving plus several long roadtrips, I\\'m sure it was the right choice. Amazing I purchased the S4 a couple months ago after researching many other similar vehicles, to include BMW and MB.  I came from a 2011 Infinite G37X and while I loved that car, you really cannot compare the two.  The Audi is simply the best vehicle I have ever driven.  My S4 has the Napa leather package and the S Sport package which I highly recommend.  This car handles amazing, it actually feels like there is someone sitting behind me steering my rear wheels while taking turns or curves at a higher speed.  The six piston brakes are awesome also.  Anyone who nit picks the steering, suspension, brakes, transmission or anything else on this car is being ridiculous.  This car is solid all the way around and this review is coming from your everyday guy.  There is nothing I don\\'t love about this car, I look forward to getting into it everyday.  Lastly for you audio enthusiasts, the Bang & Olufsen stereo is also amazing.  The louder you play it the better it gets.  I hope this review helps you when you are trying to make your decision. 2018 vs 2010 Audi S4 Prestige After much cross shopping, including the Mercedes C43 AMG, I ended up replacing my 2010 Audi S4 Prestige (7A) with a relatively loaded 2018 S4 (S- Sport and winter packages, 19\" wheels, Dynamic Steering). I\\'ve only had it for one week so this just my first impression, which is mixed. What\\'s better in the 2018 S4: suspension (more compliant with no loss of grip); brakes (less grabby with no loss of stopping power); steering (still lacks feel but quicker and more accurate, particularly off center); front seat adjustability; instrument panel; parking & driver aids; headlights; fuel economy. What\\'s better on the 2010 S4: exterior styling (except the lights); throttle response; transmission (DCT); difference in driving experience in different mode settings (comfort, auto, dynamic). It looks like the 2018 wins by a knockout but it doesn\\'t. The new car is really let down by a tendency to bog on initial throttle application. It feels like some combination of poor transmission tuning, a very soft throttle tip-in setup, and some degree of turbo lag. It can be a party pooper and the car doesn\\'t come alive in Dynamic mode they way the old one did. We\\'ll see if the 2018 S4 grows in on over time. I\\'ve already discovered that using the paddle shifters helps with throttle response. I\\'ve already shifted this car \"manually\" in one week more than I did in the old S4 over seven years.  The  ZF 8-speed in the new S4 responds pretty quickly to the paddles but doesn\\'t cope well with stacked downshift requests. I read that the terrific new 10-speed auto in high performance Chevies drops multiple gears in an instant.  More to follow once my new S4 passs the 1,000 mile break in period.Edmunds asked for an update, so here it is at 5,000 miles (February 2018).  I have warmed up to this car considerably. The performance is sneaky in that very potent acceleration, cornering and braking occur with so little fuss that it\\'s easy to caught out going much faster than appreciated. It reminds me of riding my BMW S1000RR in that regard. What is really impressive is how well a car with this performance deals with slogging on the daily commute. When surrounded by other cars that limit enjoyment, I put the car in Auto or Comfort mode, set the dynamic cruise control (on secondary roads as well as highways) and let the car deal with it while I listen to the excellent B&O sound system.  When conditions and traffic permit, I switch to the Dynamic mode with or without manual shifting and go for it. The steering and handling are excellent and with the sport diff the car actually wants to rotate, which is a rarity in front-engine Audis. The issue of delayed downshifts and throttle response persist but these are largely eliminated when Dynamic and Manual are selected. I think my original disappointment with Dynamic mode was because I followed the recommendations for light throttle inputs during break-in. There is now a distinct difference between modes, Dynamic is very crisp but happily does not cause the ride to become too brittle or edgy. The only other irksome problem I\\'ve had so far is a weak HomeLink transmitter. I have to carry the remote in the car because the built-in unit often fails to open or close the garage door. I believe this is because they relocated the transmitter from under the front fascia in the B8 to somewhere in the back end of the car in the B9 version. Indeed, if the HomeLink doesn\\'t get a response when I approach nose-in, I can turn the car around and present the back end to the garage and it will work. But that\\'s tiresome so I keep the remote in the car. Seems a dumb fault in $65K luxury sedan. I had no such problem with by B8 S4 or with my \\'14 Audi Q5 TDI. So as you can see, I have warmed up considerably to this car and would strongly recommend it to any enthusiast who wants a 4-season sport sedan that copes equally well with felonious speeds and daily driving. Every time I get in the car I look forward to driving it and the interior, including the virtual cockpit. I have also been saved a few times now by Audi Pre-Sense, Lane Assist and Cross Traffic Assist, so the technology is excellent. At 5,000 miles there have been no mechanical issues with the car and it will easily get 24-25 mpg measured at the pump unless relentlessly flogged in which case it will be in the teens. One last point - when I bought the car I was told by an Audi service manager that the 18\" Audi OEM wheels I used for winter in my B8 S4 would fit the B9. Wrong! These wheels didn\\'t clear the calipers of the new car so I had to buy aftermarket 18s to which I fitted Nokian Hakkas. Not the sportiest winter tire but absolutely the best in terms of stopping and going in snow. Simply Fantastic! Coast to Coast! 2018 S4 Prestige Coming from a 328i and being a BMW fan in general I was very skeptical, with high expectations, for the S4 and I felt like I was taking a risk when I purchased this car. Looking back, I honestly feel I could not have made a better decision. This car is simply amazing in every way. I recently drove this car coast to coast from New Jersey to San Diego and had plenty of time to break it in. Ride comfort: 40 hours and 2 1/2 days never went so fast... the Quattro handled torrential downpours to aggressive cornering like a dream. Fatigue was not an issue with the 3-way massaging seats! Driving Dynamics: The S4 accelerates like a rocket and handles like a dream at any speed. The different driving modes are critical as road conditions change. I loved how the Dynamic mode handled the winding mountains in the Southwest with ease and the comfort mode was smooth sailing through the various construction work zones across the country. Tech: The high end gizmos in the new Audi\\'s was what finally pushed me away from BMW and towards Audi. The adjustable color heads up display with Navigation and speed sign recognition worked great! Crossing America, I never had to worry about the changes in the speed limit from a high of 75 to a low of 45 in the work zones... The cameras always caught the sign changes. I had never used lane keeping assist before so there was an adjustment period but once I got used to it... it was a blessing. After hours of driving and possible fatigue it felt like you had a guardian angel by your side giving you gentle nudges to keep you on track day or night. Having Navigation on dual screens is quite nice and extremely customizable, especially zoom in/out with the scroll of your thumb. The only negative I have is that the download speeds of the Audi Connect when searching weather or traffic updates was a bit slow but not surprising considering all the digital processing constantly going on with the car. Overall this car is a dream machine that I plan to enjoy for many years to come. Very responsive in both handling and accelerating This car is very responsive in both handling and accelerating. The ride quality is still good, but may be a bit too soft for some prospective buyers looking at sport sedans. There is a wide variety of performance after-market parts for this car. Still a joy to drive... I\\'m the original owner of my 2000 Audi S4 and every time I think about getting a different car; with the next drive, I forget all about it. This car is truly a joy to drive; sports car performance with sedan versatility. Fold the rear seats down and it can hold most anything I want to haul. Currently have 86000 miles with the original turbos and the car is chipped. You can drive the car hard, but be smart about proper warm-up and cool-down for longevity. This car requires proper maintenance and it can be expensive. But in exchange, the S4 rewards you by putting a smile on your face each and every time you get behind the wheel and hit the gas. Love a first sight  I bought my Audi from my boss who needed a van for his family so I took it off his hands. I was like love a first sight. I\\'ve had it for a year. Dependable, great handling. Works great in the winter. Haven\\'t seen a car around town to beat me. Really fast car and nice luxurious touch in the inside as well as the outside Great car Purchased this car new and have really enjoyed it. Now that it\\'s 8 years old I\\'m thinking about something else, but this one is still a lot of fun and I only have 65k miles on it. No major problems but have had issues with the navigation system (ok, maybe in 2000 it was OK, but really is a joke by today\\'s standards) a hand full of sensors and what I\\'m told is carbon build up on the intake plenum that seems to need cleaning all the time.  Excellent Car I just purchased this beautiful car through a private sale, 180000 kms. The car is still as beautiful as the day it was made, everything works perfect. Great power and amazing handling. I love the interior design but there might be a bit too many buttons. Looks really good with aftermarket Pirelli tires and 18inch rims. Overall this car is a 10/10 for me. Hope you enjoy yours as much! Great Car This car is by far the best car I have purchased. I knew I wanted to go towards German Automotive, but I had no idea the excellence I was getting myself into with buying this S4. All my friends a drowning in their envy. I love this car. What a fun car! In both summer and winter conditions, this car is amazing. With a twin turbo and plenty of horspower it really moves. In the winter, with the right snow tires it handles amazingly well (better than my wifes huge landcruiser). Note, make sure that you put winter snow tires on this car if you drive in the snow. the summer tires that come with the car are dangerous in snow. Overall, I loved owning this car! Great when purchased, great now. This has been an excellent car.  Snows/winter wheels essential, and it is like a cat.  Mostly problem free... new headlight washer pump(s?) and oxygen sensor, the latter fixed under emissions control warranty.  Otherwise just routine maintenance.  Performance suggest torque/hp ratings understated, as it feels fully as quick as the newer V8 models.  Interior is of ultra high quality materials and design, and looks/feels as new after more than 6 years.  Whole car is tight and performs as new.  An absolute bargain at today\\'s used car value, even putting aside $ for possible eventual repairs. This car is so well-rounded Looks, performance, practical body style, reasonable price, and all- weather capability. Reliability of mine has been much better than some of the stories I have heard.  Currently 103 kmi on it and the following has happened: water temperature sending unit replaced, three rear wheel bearings replaced (one twice), ABS module rebuilt, three rear Bose speakers replaced (one twice), cruise control needed electrical cleaner, headlight washers were fixed, front brakes replaced twice (normal), timing belt changed, along with all- associated hardware and a failing water pump (normal, but expensive repair), battery replaced (normal) and MAF sensor replaced. Up to 28 mi/gal achieved.  Great car I have the car three years and only mods were a APR chip and K&N. Big difference in performance and has been very reliable.  Had to do timing belt and water pump at 72000 because water pump puked.  Very expensive part of the ownership.  Car is awsome and very aatractive.  Used it for a work commuter for a year but found gas expensives forced car to become weekend toy. AMAZING!!!!! The Audi S4 is about the most amazing vehicle that I have ever driven.  This completely outdoes any corvette.  I just drove the new C6 and my S4 is faster and more fun to drive, and much more of an everyday car!!  I give it hands down to Audi for their amazing technology and design. Never Again! In the 18 months I\\'ve owned this vehicle I put in over $3000 in repairs & maintenance.  Something is continually going wrong with this car:  Fuel gauge unit, throttle body, fuel line, ABS control unit, CV boot, turn signal.  These were not minor repairs as the parts and labor were very expensive.  I hope to sell this care very soon.  I will never own another Audi. Great car, take care of it The K03 turbo chargers run out of air in the upper RPM range.  In order to get full performance out of this car the turbos will need replacement.  You will probably blow the stock ones anyways so plan on either getting a car that has a warranty, or spending some serious dough out of pocket to get them fixed The Perfect Car? Excellent acceleration and handling.  Great summer cruiser and ski vehicle.  27mpg on trips. Tends to sandblast rocker panels over time. Essentially a 4-wheel drive, 4-door Corvette I can use to haul my kids to the ski slopes! Still a great car I\\'ve had my 2000 Audi S4 for two years now, and \\rit continues to thrill me each and \\revery time I drive it.  It\\'s been \\rreliable (so far) and is great fun to \\rdrive in the midwest in winter with \\rsnow tires.  I have held off on \\rupgrading to the newer version, cause \\rI am still happy to be driving this \\reach day.  Fun to drive, nightmare to own Issues included:\\rA/C system was improperly \\rassembled and poured water into the \\rpassenger seat. Water pump, catalytic \\rconverters, oxygen sensors, and coil \\rpacks - all replaced. When I brought it \\rin last week, the ABS computer was \\rshot. Cruise control switch shot. This \\rcar is a piece of crap. When the \\rcats and pre-cats were \\rreplaced under an emissions system \\rwarranty, at Metro, I had to pay \\rfor new O2 sensors. They were an Audi \\rmandated repair along with the \\rconverters, but Audi wouldn\\'t cover it \\rEVEN THOUGH THEY REQUIRED IT AS PART OF \\rTHE WARRANTY REPAIR. I got Audi \\rcustomer service to cover half the \\rcost, and they acted like they were \\rdoing me a favor. Love/Hate Love it: Fun to drive, especially in \\rthe twisties of the North Georgia \\rmountains. Plenty of room for the \\rfamily of four and trunk space for \\rtravel or sports events. Still my \\rfavorite car since my 67 Firebird \\rConvertible (and drives much better).\\r Hate it: In less than 35000 miles it \\rhas needed a new radio, transmission, \\rclutch, flywheel, driver\\'s airbag, and \\rin-dash electronics. Also, on third set \\rof tires (Bridgestones went at 6k and \\r17k). Most (including tires) has been \\rcovered under warranty (3 years only). My \\'00 S4 The most fun I have ever had in a 4 door ride.  My \\rbuddies \\'03 M3 is fun to drive but the S4 is a much \\rsmoother ride. The minor issues I\\'ve had were all \\rcovered by warranty... wiper sprayer pump, plastic \\rradiator reservior tank crack, etc.\\r C. Awesome Ride!! I have owned 17 new and used cars over \\rthe past 25 years and by far this is \\rthe best!  No other car has even come \\rclose to offering the total package \\rthat the S4 delivers.  Handling, \\racceleration, braking, comfort,and \\rluxury best car yet Love it besr car i had Beats my BMW Love this car! Bought it new in 2000 \\rafter test driving it.....the salesman \\rsaid I\\'d buy it and he was right!  Have \\r50,000 miles on it and the only trouble \\rwas a wheel bearing at 36000 miles.  \\rStill drives like new.  Put a Garrett \\rIndustries chip in it and it has 310hp \\rand will drive up a wall with the 4wd.  \\rGreat in snow with 4 snow tires and in \\rthe summer with 4 performance tires.  \\rBeats the pants of my old 540 BMW at 15 \\rgrand less! Stealthy, wild & fun Have loved my S4 since March 04\\' - \\rwould have chosen stick, but couldn\\'t \\rwait to have one. I am just as happy \\rwith this car since day 1.  No \\rproblems.  Fast!  Diplay panel is like \\rjet dashboard - lights up red, and all \\rpassengers comment.  I am still \\rfinding features I didn\\'t know existed \\ron the car.  For winter geo\\'s - must \\rhave winter tires!  Perf\\'s only during \\rother seasons- dont mix with all \\rseason - you lose the experience. Fundamental design flaw There is a reason Audi stopped selling \\rars with the 2.7 liter engine.  The \\rengine is flawed BY DESIGN.\\rThe 2000-2002 S4s (B5 platform) all \\rcame with K03 turbo chargers.  Given \\rthe way the 2.7 liter engine in the S4 \\rwas designed, this turbo does not have \\radequate cooling to prolong it\\'s life.  \\rIT WILL FAIL, even if you don\\'t race or \\rchip the car.  When the turbos fail, it \\rrequires removal of ENTIRE ENGINE to \\rreplace them.  This is close to $6000 \\rin labor and parts.  The problem can be \\ravoided in the future by replacing the \\rK03 with K04 turbos, but it\\'s \\rexpensive. This flawed design has \\rcontributed to the lousy resale value.  \\rDO NOT BUY THIS CAR! STAY AWAY! Love my S4 This has been the best car I have ever \\rowned.  Fun to drive, but with the \\rcomfort, solidity, etc. you expect from \\ra 40k car.  52000 miles & I still \\rabsolutely love the car. Practicality was never so much fun! The S4 is an outstanding overall \\rvehicle for someone who likes to have \\rfun driving but has practical needs \\rtoo -- like a fold-down rear seat, \\rdecent trunk, four doors, etc.  Also \\rfun to modify: for $600 I bought a chip \\r(APR) that adds 58 hp and 100 lb ft of \\rtorque, making torque 358!!!  Quarter \\rmile under 14 yet still a comfortable \\rride.  s4best of the best like street racer and also audi\\'s big  fast four door best four door sedan i ever own.better  Great Car This is a great car.  I have owned \\rother high performance vehicles in the \\rpast (C4 Vette) and I have found that I \\renoy this one the most.  The \\rcombination of practicality and high \\rperformance is unbeatable.  I would \\rrecommend this car to anyone who is \\rserious about owning a high quality, \\rthoroughly enjoyable daily driver.  \\rAudi was crazy for stopping production \\rof this one! Best Car I \\'ve  Ever had Fast, dependable, great to drive, classy, \\rGREAT service, wouldn\\'t trade it for \\ranything: NO problmes of any kind - \\r26,000miles e(S)tatic about the S4 Unbelieveable car!!!  Has tons of \\rtorque and tons of control.  It rides a \\rlittle softer than the M3 (good or bad \\rbased on the persons choice).  The car \\ris subdued for a \"sports\" sedan when \\ryou talk about exhaust note.  Again, \\rplus or minus depending on the owner.  \\rThe Quattro is the best in the industry \\rbut because of the perf. focus of the \\rcar you need snow tire for the really \\rfoul weather (1-1/2 more of snow).  The \\rtrunk space is good and again larger \\rthan its main competitor (the M3).  The \\rS4 is a amazing car with no turbo lag \\rand almost limitless potential with \\rsmall modifications. Oh my word! FAST! Bought this rocket ship in April of \\r2000. Ever since, it has been the \\rfastest, coolest car ever.  I can beat \\ralmost any car on the road if I wanted \\rto, (except for some Ferraris or \\rPorsches or Maseratis) but it is the \\rfastest, most luxirios sedan out \\rthere!  I drove it out of the \\rdealership amazed at how fast it is.  \\rThe bi-turbo engine is wonderful.  The \\rinterior is also luxirious, like all \\rAudis.  This is my second Audi; my \\rfirst was a 1996 A4.   best all-round car I\\'ve been through everything in this \\rcar! Love the acceleration,smooth \\rpower.Handling is great,typical \\roversteer for 4 wheel drive.Great long \\rdistance too.Gear shifting needs to be \\rtighter.As strange as it sounds i got \\rhit at 70mph on the passenger side \\rlast summer,to be honest the car saved \\rmy life.Quality build.Quality Car! s4 rocks This car does everything great. If you \\rhave the chance to own one go for \\rit.Fit and finish is the best. Quattro \\ris worth it\\'s weight in gold. All wheel \\rdrive rules. Turbo\\'s are still spinning \\rfine !!! 30,000 trouble free miles. unique so far no disappoinments at all,stock \\rpower is amazing, stability super, i \\rcoud`nt recomend a better value for \\rthe money. Great for mods... Excellent car that you can tune  This one has it all! Great performance, looks, comfort, \\rsafety, practicality & luxury-- for \\rthose who need to \"have it all\" in one \\rvehicle, the S4 is hard to beat. My Review Great car. Practical, fun. Attracts \\rlittle extra attention but goes like \\rhell yet under control ULTIMATE SPORTS SEDAN!!! I happened to be in the position \\rto \"test drive\" this car.  I haven\\'t \\rdriven too many cars in my life, but \\rthis rates as the #1 experince ever.  \\rNot only does this car come stock w/ \\rmore than ample power coupled w/ the \\ragility of the quattro drive system; \\rbut this car has tons of aftermarket \\rtuning potential.  Twin turbo induction \\rthat is only steps away from running \\r90% of the nations cars off of the \\rroad.  This car here is the true \\rdefinition of Phenom.  Move over BMW \\rthis IS the Ultimate Driving Machine. Audi S4: Boxster with 4 Doors --incredibly fast, nimble, comfortable, \\ryet actually packs a back seat.  \\r--bought a used 2000 model for \\rabout 30k, about a year ago.  The S4 \\ris overall, the most satisfying and \\rbalanced car on the (used) market.  It \\ris very close to a Boxster with 4 \\rdoors. more stable than a 911, seats \\r4, and very snow capable, unlike the \\rM3. Audi S4 2000 Superb! If you like performance, this \\rcar is spectacular - especially for the \\rmoney. So far so good I bought my S4 in July of 2000. After \\rthe break in period I started to really \\rlet it out, and boy what a blast! The \\rcar handles beautifully! The S4 \\rdesperately wants to cruise at 80mph \\rall day, and you have to practice \\rserious restraint to maintain \\rresponsible driving practice. \\r Since 2000 I have only had a problem 2 \\rminor problems: 1)The horn, which after \\ra good prolonged blast (think: NYC \\rtraffic)looses \"pressure\" and is \\rrendered inoperative - I\\'ve \"fixed\" it \\rtwice so far.\\r 2)The low profile Bridgestone Potenza \\rtires that came with the 2000 model are \\rnot suitable for winter driving. Even \\rwith Quattro! A wolf in sheep\\x92s clothing I have owned a lot of cars through my  Best I ever had - Fun and practicality Every aspect of the car is well thought out.  The factory is very cooperative. The  3 Years of Bliss I bought my S4 new, sight unseen. The very first time I drove it I was struck by how smooth the car felt. The shifting, the steering, the HVAC and radio controls and the ride, everything felt smooth, well controled, solid. It is still a superior automobile with few flaws.  The car tends to understeer at the limit (which is very high), the shifter has a very smooth solid action but feels vague shifting to 2nd and 3rd.  The backseat lacks legroom for tall passengers.  Overall though this car is excellent, easily superior to the BMW M3 is terms of overall performance driving to and from work.  But if you do track events... AUDI s4 This Car is A great Car Performance pkus MPG! Effortless power with the Supercharged V6, can be run as docile as any grocery-getter, but coax it slightly, and it will respond with extreme urgency,  all while attaining 18-26+ MPG. This car is a rocket!!! It is a 2015 S4. I\\'ve always driven sport/luxury cars including Volvo S60 R-Design, Infiniti G35 and G37 Sports and this is one of the best I\\'ve had. Crazy fast, the sound and kick in the pants is intoxicating when you bury your right foot and that supercharger kicks in. Interior is one of the nicest and infotainment/MMI is the best for ease of use. If you love music as I do you have to go for the B & O sound system. Two minor complaints; front brakes needed to be done at 22,000 miles and I must be getting old because the seats aren\\'t as comfy after about 2 hours in the car. Up for a replacement this fall and the short list consists of the new Audi S5 Sportback, the Volvo S60 Polestar or the Lincoln MKZ with the 400 hp twin turbo. I know, it\\'s North American but I will know once I have driven it.UPDATE. The car goes back at the end of October and I am going for the Lincoln MKZ with the twin turbo 400 hp AWD. I am impressed with the car, only reason for changing from Audi is the Lincoln is a bit bigger, a bit softer (bad back) and it\\'s maybe just time for a change. I will miss the roar of the Audi when you put your foot into it but the 2018 Audi with the turbo instead of the supercharger is a bit more subdued anyway.UPDATE 3/12/18. Have had the Lincoln MKZ for 2 1/2 months and no regrets. Absolutely amazing car and exactly what I was looking for. Best sleeper on the road. Definite Head-turner Bought the 2015 as new in early 2016. Very impressed. Although technology package is lacking with poor interface and lack of USB port, the Bang and Olufsen (sp?) system is amazing. The radio can be played very loud and sound crisp and full in the cabin, yet is not noticed by outsiders. The \"muscle\" of the car is best noted when hitting the gas at 60 mph and accelerating afterward. The car\\'s curb appeal is very impressive as many people stop to gaze... Easy to live with The S4 does everything well. It is very quick, handles well, and brakes well. After approximately 11,000 mi. (in a year and a half) it is holding up well, and it still looks sharp. The miles are low because our summer drive is a Porsche Cayman S. The S4 is about as quick in a straight line, but it can\\'t compare to the Porsche\\'s road-holding. (Part of the difference lies in tires.)At nearly 14,000 miles, we still feel this is a great car. The supercharged V6 is a delight, and the transmission works well with it. \\'No problems to report.Update: After another 4,000 miles, we still think this is a great car. \\'Will buy another in a year or two if they didn\\'t mess up the V6.Update: At nearly 20,000 mi., we still think this is a great car. No problems to report. Highway mpg is in the 32-34 range. coming up on a year and still love it I had a 2006 corvette and a 05 acura tl.  This car is like a combo of both   I got it due to the security of the awd but  at least touring on the highway  it handles well is super comfortable and in S mode is quite fast.   I did the upgraded leather and tech package and all in all  it feels  like it cost easily 40,000 more then  I paid for it.  It is not a flashy car but understated and  beautiful.It gets returned for the lease in a month. I will miss it.   Nits to pick the computer is horrible  the time it takes to boot up, the lack of music for  minutes after starting the car.  My wife\\'s escape  sync system is better.  Styling tends to blend in   not a flashy car by any means.  Still a very comfortable  cruiser.  I had fun tackling the twisties in W VA. Great Engineering and performance The car is built and engineered well. The handling and acceleration are great (in dynamic mode). The instrument layout, interior materials etc are what you expect from Audi and German engineers in general. My only gripe is that there aren\\'t any USB ports in a 2015 model higher end car. It has 2 SD ports which personally I don\\'t have much if any use for. However, it\\'s a small issue in the grand scheme. I\\'ve only had to go to the dealer for a routine oil change and to date no other issues worth noting. First week of my new love Now I have to say I am a car guy and like fast sporty cars. Did a bunch of research in my price range and lean more towards sport that comfort. Traded in a 2009 G37 that I had really liked but I am already in love and over that. This is my first German car and after looking at dealer inventory and not seeing exact features I wanted I looked at it and ordered it from factory my way. I couldn\\'t be happier with the way my exterior, interior and sport options turned out. This car rocks literally with Bang Olfsun and rides like its on rails. The acceleration and drive handling are superb and it\\'s just fun to drive. I keep it in dynamic mode because it\\'s responsive and fast. Awesome car.  2015 s4  Stronic  what a kick! this car is fast, THIS CAR IS FAST, this car is fun!! The S tronic  tranny makes this car a pleasure to drive.Acts like a MT without all the hassle.You can stay is D mode for all a round economy or pull down gear shift to go into S mode. In S the shift points are raised . You can also make car settings for steering, engine sounds, power, sport differential through MIMI.It can be reasonably tame or like a muscle  car in disguise. The sport differential cost an additional $1100  ORDER it . It significantly changes for the better the way the car handles, and you can program it for different driving situations. Amazing sleeper car. Down side,the plastic trim on window frames scratches easily    Up date  got 3 m pro film put on plastic trim on windows., no more visible scratches, dealer paid for it. only one glitch, radio would not respond to volume control on steering wheel. It returned to normal in three days, no problem since, You will get clicking noise at exactly 9mph after you stop. It is the electric motor mounts, very faint., not all times. All Audis do it, Great car, still glad I bought it 2 years later.Stiil  a rocket ship  , a sleeper  muscle car in disguise.  UPDATE  the v-6 engine has has a TSB  Technical Service Bulletin to perform a change to timing chain tensioners. both my local Audi dealers have not yet performed this TSB. Audi claims no damage is not done. On initial start up a few times in a week, there is a sound ,timing chain rattle. It lasts for a few seconds. My car is at the 21K mark. I have an extended Audi warranty until Jan 2024. If the engine blows up ,I am covered with only  $100 deductible. The noise is a minor annoyance. Several Audi S4 owners  have reported on user board Audizine, that the noise has returned AFTER the TSB was done. Others have reported  many issues while dealers tried to do TSB. It is major surgery. Now that there are reports that TSB is not successful.I  am not having it done. Fast, fun, a joy to drive I loved driving this car.  It was fast, fun, responsive - a joy to drive.   The Audi Nav system was far better than my wife\\'s Porsche or any of the MB\\'s that we\\'ve driven (her mom\\'s, for instance). Miss it already My favorite car ever.  Great acceleration and power!  Fun to drive long and short distances.  I never knew I could like a car this much.  Traded recently for a 2018 same model with more bells and whistles but I will always remember this one!  Highly recommend anyone looking to purchase used that these are a great bargain! MY 2013 w/110,xxx Mile Review This is my 1st Audi and unfortunately my last, not because my experience with my s4 was poor but because Audi s4\\'s will no longer be offered with a manual transmission.  I am very impressed with my s4, thus far 1 unscheduled visit to the dealer to repair a leaking water pump (covered under warranty @46k miles).  I now have over 110k miles.  I went with a \"Stage 1\" software upgrade from Revo when the car hit 50k miles....best bang for the buck upgrade I\\'ve ever done.  333hp in stock form to 410hp and torque from 325 ft/lbs to 390 ft/lbs, not only did I get a lot more torque (which is noticeable when overtaking) but my mpg improved as well!  No other issues to report.  I am due to replace my OE clutch.  The ride is stiffer than in the past, I think the shocks are on their way out.  The interior has worn well, no tears on the seats and minimal stretch marks on the leather seats.  The navigation is a tad on the slow side (as others have mentioned).  The car is heavy though and I can definitely feel the heft when I track it.  Because of it\\'s heft, the brakes get worked thoroughly....on the street, you won\\'t notice any brake fade (just on the track).  Tire wear is even, perhaps due to the AWD system, you really don\\'t need performance tires.  The s4 has impressive lateral grip. Fuel economy has dramatically improved from 23.1mpg when new to now I\\'m consistently getting almost 27mpg (mostly highway driving).  In the 110k history with my s4, I\\'m on my 4th set of tires (OE Continentals & 3 sets of Pilot Sports), on my 3rd pair of brakes (front), 2nd pair brakes (rear), and 1 headlight bulb replaced (right).  Everything else, just fluid changes.  Hope this helps any future owners...... Vrooom Vrooom Love this car!Two years later, no problems. Still a blast! My S4 Experience If you want a cushy car, this isn\\'t it.  This car is designed for performance and the experience of driving. You will find quieter and cushier cars in this category, but the S4 gives you a \"feel of the road\" that you won\\'t find in other cars at this level. S4 brings back the fun of driving The S4 is a great combination of a sedan and a sporty fun to drive sports car.It responds well to normal day to day driving and handles anything the road throws at you. When given the chance to drive it in sport mode this car wants to take off and runs the curves like its on rails. I have run this car in autocross events over a dozdn times and ut is a blast to run the corse and try nkt to hit any cones. A lot of fun to drive and yet very reasonable for a daily drive car. The gas milage seems to be getting better as I own it longer. The last 600 mile trip I got 31.7 highway driving 79 mph. Audi has a winner with the S4! Steering issues overall the S4 is a very nice car. Plenty of power and good overall handling. MPG is good as well averaging 25 combined in 7500 miles. Tires that come on the car are summer tires, not sure why they deliver a car in NJ in December with summer tires, do not try to get through the winter with them, you will need to put all season tires on.Navigation is not up to par with other vehicles i have owned and slow to load data and respond, also no touch screen. Biggest issue i have is with the electric steering, the on center feel is terrible, worst part about it is Audi acknowledges there is a problem but has no solution.Dealer says Audi is working on it. Car is 6 months old and still no solution Best All-around This car simply has it all. Compared to competitors it has the best interior of any, classy, luxurious, quality. It\\'s fast, but not too fast to use on the street. The handling is superb, traction is outstanding especially with the Active Rear Dif option. It is grown up and elegant, a head turner anywhere, but aggressive without being gaudy and can be turned loose and feel like a pure speed machine. Take it on seriously curvy switch-back type mountain roads and you will realize was this car was born to do. It is the perfect all- a-rounder, not a kid racer and not a stuffy old guy car. It is a perfect blend of all aspects the someone looking at this range of car could want. Excellent vehicle! The car is absolutely, all around, excellent! I have owned a BMW M3, Cadillac CTS, and Mercedes E350. This blows all of them away!! Fast, Fun, Quality and space makes this a best buy in my book! I love the style, gas mileage and absolute fun I have when I drive it. I read a review somewhere that said don\\'t test drive unless you are ready to write the check. No truer words have been spoken. Still wake up at 4 am to drive Was looking for a daily commuter that would still fit car seats AND be fun to drive. Found it in the S4. I still wake up at 4 am on weekends to go drive. It makes me smile every time. Almost perfect This car is so much fun to drive and so quiet, I have to keep checking the speedometer to make sure I\\'m not speeding. Build quality is excellent. The car feels really solid. The manual transmission is a joy to use. It even makes shifting suggestions. The car has so much torque that I\\'m often in 6th gear going 50 km/hr and still have decent passing power. Performance, Luxury and Practicality! My last car was a \\'09 A5. I had considered the previous generation S4 but was wary about the fuel consumption of the V8 in the city and wanted the new B8 body style. I enjoyed the A5 but it left me longing for more performance (and 4 doors). Once I heard that the new S4 was running a supercharged V6 I had to check it out. One drive and I was hooked. Nothing else at the S4 price point offers the same combination of performance and luxury. This car is the ultimate sport sedan- step on it and you\\'re gone or drive casually around town in Comfort Mode (w/ ADS or Sport Differential). If you\\'re looking for a sports car experience in a versatile daily driver, this is your car. Love it! I have had my S4 for a few weeks now and absolutely love it. The price is reasonable, especially when you compare it to the A4 with S-Line package. The supercharged engine is amazing. Instant torque whenever you need it. Great handling, grip and performance. It effortlessly accelerates you to 80 mph before you can get off the on-ramp! It makes driving fun...even the boring commute to and from work. The 7-speed DSG can be a little aggressive on the shifting at times when you are driving it easy. Dynamic mode / Sport mode is great...the throttle/engine performance is brilliant. You will be hooked upon test driving this car so be careful if you make your way to the dealership just to \"explore\". Love that Sport Setting  on tranny This will be the 3rd S4 I\\'ve owned over 10yrs and feels the fastest. Still not sure about the big  snout but the Audi\\'s tail is nice. 0-35mph around town was disappointing till I tried the Sport setting, now it is much more linear and fun. I love the Sport setting in the city!!! Try it and it becomes addictive. Beautiful interior, great seats,  big trunk and 4 doors in a car that can easily keep up with the other German Cars around town in real world driving. Wonderful Machine I took what was in the dealership and that included the DSG 7 speed, differential, drive select, sound system and Sat Nav. I would normally have only selected the the DSG and diff, but they all work well. The differential is a must, but the drive select works well with a comfort mode that has a much softer throttle, compliant suspension and lighter steering - I use it around town. The striking feature of the car is the usability of the performance. The car is extremely safe and stable at all times and very comfortable in long trips - no more back ache and numbness. The real world performance is surprising - no sound or fury at traffic lights - a gentle right foot, and the car is gone Highly Recommended Vehicle Only 700 chars, so I\\'ll be brief:  0-60, better than: - BMW 335i/xi - Infiniti G37S - Volkswagen GTI  0-60, slower than: - BMW M3 - Porsche Carrera S - Chevrolet Corvette  1/4-mi, better than: - Ford Mustang GT - Camaro SS - Nissan 370Z  1/4-mi, slower than: - Mitsubishi Evo X - Porsche Cayman S - Lexus IS-F  Interior fit & finish is superb, and bucket seats are excellent (esp. in two-tone). MMI interface is way better than BMW\\'s iDrive, only the external cables are expensive (why not just have standard inputs?) Brakes are phenomenal, and cornering is breathtaking.  Also of note, Audi\\'s 333 hp rating is horribly wrong (possibly due to delayed RS4) Rock stable Dual personality Complete control in any weather with the best tires. Very comfortable for a sports sedan that will cruse at 70 getting 26 MPG. Few compromises in design or function only in price to own and options lacking at $50K.  Best Sport Sedan Hands down. This car was the most researched vehicle I have ever purchased. I test drove with my wife the I- G37, M-C350, L-GS 350, A-TL, BMW 335 and yes the Audi S4. All the cars were great but the S4 really stood out on the interior finish also the acceleration with the 7-speed automatic was powerful & seamless. The fact that it didn\\x92t have much of an exhaust note I viewed as a plus. The ride when not pushed is very comfortable but make no mistake this car is a wolf in sheep clothing when you ask the car to perform it is an animal! The S4 we ordered and purchased is a red automatic, prestige, driver assist, red & black silk Napa leather, dark birch trim and Audi drive select.  Great car I love this car !!! I have had 3 beemers. an Audi A8L and an Acura in the last 7-8 yrs. This car is the bomb. Not too flashy but just the right amount of class. handles like a sports cars with a comfortable ride. The features in the car are topnotch. quality,Quality, Quality!!!  Almost perfect A driver\\'s car with addictive torque - Don\\'t test drive unless you\\'re ready to write a check. The handling is crisp with little body roll.  This vehicle has 2 personalities, one that allows the comfort, space, and utility to be my daily driver and a second that has power, handling, and an unbelievable sense of connection to the road...it\\'s almost perfect. Great Vehicle I drove the S4 and ended up buying it with the prestige package, rear sport differential, rear side air bags, and silk nappa leather.  Hands down a nicer quality car than the BM\\'s I tested. The S4 is much nicer inside and out.  The ride is smooth and the car is quiet, until you unleash the beast under the hood.  The S4 handles great and is very fast, I highly recommend this car!  A lot of fun Originally had wanted the A5.  Drove the S4 after the A5 and absolutely loved it.  The power is always available, immediately! The car is extremely well refined and quiet but can be a beast when necessary. Mileage is great. I love driving this car... every day. Test drive it!! I am sooo glad.... I am soooo glad I recalculated the price of the S4 Prem Plus vs. initially ordered Avant Prem Plus with Nav, B&O.  The difference was minimal and the enjoyment is not easily describable.  This car is simply amazing -- the engine, Handling, quietness when cruising, growl when step on it,  Inside is nicely laid out, and beautifully appointed.  The 6MT is super nice; I am coming off the latest gen BMW 3-series (E90) and this 6MT is much better (smoother, as precise, shorter) than the BMW\\'s.  The S4 seats are much more supportive and comfortable than the 3er with the Sports Package. New Hotness Last 5 cars: Audi A4, Infinity G35, BMW 325, 328, 530.  Wanted a German car larger than a 3 and smaller than a 5 series.  This Audi is essentially a 4 series size.  The back seats are usable.  The car is flawless inside and out.  The A4 was a better value but the sport seats not as nice, engine was a bit noisy at 85MPH with 6 speed.  The S4 with a  330 HP 7 speed is composed in the city and a beast on the highway when you need it to be.  Effortless power and stability.  It is not quite as agile as a BMW 3 that has better weight balance but is more stable at speed since it is larger and safer. Audi excels in style, composure, beauty and in the S4 version is rare. 29MPG Hwy, 25 MPG city. Bang for the buck Simply the best car I have owned and here is my list of previous cars: 07 M5, 05 M3, 06 Cayman, 03 M5.Just purchased a 07 S4 convertible with 24k miles.This is an outstanding car for the money.It performs very well, goes where you point it and blazing fast.I smile every time I turn the key in the morning.Gas mileage is what it is and you can average over 20mpg in the city if you baby it. I have a family of 4 and this car is the perfect machine for a daily driver and fun for the dad.And that Audi craftsmanship, you can\\x92t go wrong there either. German V8 Just purchased the car 1 month ago. I read all the car magazines and previously owned an M5, a Corvette and a Porsche Boxer, but this car beats them all. I now understand what handling like if it were on rails means. Gorgeous exterior and interior, much nicer than BMW. Sound of V8 is absolutely addictive. I love its rumble, even at low speeds. Only downer is the awful gas mileage. At 80 on the highway you be lucky to get 20 to 21 MPG (My Vette used to get close to 30)A few cowl shakes, but then, it\\'s a convertible. I love it ! Fun car I love this car. It is one of the most fun cars you will ever drive. Putting that top down in a matter of seconds and zooming down the road with the air blowing in your face is just spectacular. The roar of the engine from the exhaust sytem is just invigorating. Love it.  2007 Audi S4 Avant I bought the S4 Avant (specifically not the sedan) because I have dogs and they go everywhere with me.  I\\'m more than frustrated with the air circulation in this car. I live in Phoenix. Audi absolutely missed the boat when it comes to the comfort of anyone not sitting in the front.  There are no air vents in the back (except on the floor) and while there are air vents in the back of the car, they\\'re only for defrosting and work only when heat comes through them.  I\\'m forced to drive my Volvo for four months out of the year because it\\'s literally cruel to have my dogs baking in the back (even though the a/c is on high).  Don\\'t buy this car unless you plan to only have one passenger. The most compliments I\\'ve ever had Very fast, sounds mean!! I\\'m an old skool NY guy that\\'s had many different cars. Used to be into American musscle back in the day.. Something happened to the exhaust and the car sounded like an out of control obnoxious American musscle car !! I loved it and it turned heads like you wouldn\\'t believe. Unfortunately I had to get it fixed to pass inspection.. Overall I love the car and the all wheel drive is amazing in the snow. I got it with over 100k miles so I\\'m a little scarred to use the paddle shifters. I always drive in S.... The car gets respect from EVERY NATIONALITY , color and most importantly the girls like it lol.. It burs oil , and the glove box and center console broke. The heater makes a little noise..gas miles is horrible but what do you expect with a v8 awd monster!!? I heard there real expensive to fix so I may pick up an 05 ACURA RL Awd and put some $$ back in my pocket and cash out before anything major happens.. what more can i ask for A high-revving V8 with 300+ hp and torque, AWD, luxury appointments, good looks inside and out, not everyone has one, it leaves little more to desire.The only thing is better gas mileage but what can you expect from an AWD sports sedan with a V8.And it\\'s about fair compared to other V8 sedans in its class.I will probably use all the 340hp less than 5% of the time but it\\'s great to have the option to travel that fast when you need it.Plus that sound is music to my ears.Interior is typical Audi fashion - business like but materials, design, fit and finish are the best in the bunch. I haven\\'t received a single complaint about the backseat room yet Rock Solid Machine After a long and arduous search and having owned many brands/models prior (BMW, Infiniti, Cadillac, Honda, Benz) I still keep coming back to Audi.  Without a doubt Audi still makes the most refined and well thought out interiors in the world.  I kept going back and forth between M3 and S4 and after much local searching was able to snag a low mile, pristine S4 from a private seller.  Having owned an A6, 2.7T manual prior I was more than ready for a return.  This car is amazing...it fits you like a glove, handles like few others on the road and is a practical hauler for life. I love this car This car is awesome. In no way too flashy. The audi S4 performs really well and gets the job done on the road. I chose it mainly because I wanted a complete package I could enjoy for years to come. It is also a pretty rare car and I have only seen one more other exact car as mine on the road. I have the dtm package on black so its a very low profile look. The exhaust sound is very menacing stock and it sounds amazing with the windows down. The transmission shifts smoothly and the power is across the whole power band. Its amazing how you don\\'t have to wait for any turbo to give you the extra power you need. Its all there.  06 Audi S4 Sedan Manual Very fun car to drive, incredible engine.  Love the sound of the V8, do not love the gas mileage of the V8, but always worth it.  Still the best interiors on the market.  Only negative is that the brakes sometimes squeal. 2007 S4 manual transmission My 5th quattro in a row, but my 1st \"S\". It is a sublime rocket described as a compact, four door family sedan. It may be the one of the best \"sleeper\" cars currently available. Its power and brakes border or intrude on true sports car territory. The build quality is superb. It is bank vault solid with close to excellent feedback of the road and driving conditions. The exhaust note sold me on the car. It is a car enthusiasts Beethoven\\'s fifth. It will not attract unwanted attention but will certainly capture the onlookers attention as it roars past with the silky V8 at full song at 7000 RPM. Certainly my best car purchase to date and zero regrets. First months of ownership This is my first Audi/German car. I was looking for a fun, safe, classy car that would accommodate my 6 year old twins. I looked at all cars under 60k. The S4 fulfilled all my expectations and more. I still find new features on the car, i.e. the way it channels rain over the car not on the side windows and the memory of seat, mirror and climate settings tied to the remote. The build quality is excellent. It is so solid. The speed is addictive.  Cornering is phenomenal. It\\'s limits cannot be safely explored on the street.  I am a quattro convert. Sharp car that is fun to drive  Bought this car a few months ago and really enjoy the V8 power on tap and the crisp handling.  This is my first Audi and I have been very impressed.  The gas mileage is below average, but I knew this going in and I don\\'t think the car should be penalized for it. Audi S4 Outstanding performance; agile and responsive; excellent braking and steering; more comfortable than its BMW counterpart; great engine sounds; excellent build quality. The only disadvantage, which is a given for this kind of performance, is relatively poor mileage... 22 on open road. Road Machined This is my second S4; a black on black automatic sedan with carbon fibre trim; bluetook; parktronic; premium sound; navigation and front heated seats. The car is sensational - even better than the first. The combination of the handling with the steering wheel controlled tiptronic transmission is fantastic. The navigation is a first for me and is a fascinating feature as in the bluetooth cell phone feature which is a must option in my view. This is a great road and highway vehicle; it comes close to handling as well as my 2004 40th Anniversary Porsche 911 coupe with short shifter, sport exhaust and H&R springs. The AWD with snows makes for year-round fun in the northeast. In short, worth the $$. Audi Rocks Such a fun car to drive. Mysteriously fast, but you don\\'t feel it because of the quietness inside. The build quality is bar none. Rock solid smoothness and handling. At first I didn\\'t like the sirius/navigation/radio controls because I missed having buttons to push to change stations. Having now used the wheels on the steering wheel, I find it much easier and less distracting then those old push buttons. One downside of this marvelous machine is its gas mileage. Audi needs to address this issue. Pretty good car. This car is FAST I bought this 10  months ago. I have had no problems at all. Performed 15,000 mile service at DFW. Can\\'t wait for our dealership in Lubbock to get completed this summer. The rear seat could use more legroom, but that\\'s expected from this class of car and it does better than average. I am happy to have gotten it the last year before the redesign. Audi taught me about German Engineering First the good things.  The car looks great, sounds great, drives very well, and is a lot of fun...when it\\'s working.  It is surprisingly spacious for a convertible.  It\\'s powerful but because it\\'s heavy, it rather needs to be...but it accelerates well.  I think it should be all these good things, because it was the most expensive car I\\'ve ever bought, and not my first convertible.  I should have listened to friends right after I bought mine - they got a lemon and swore \"Audi - never again.\"  For me it\\'s also been, by far, the most trouble of any car I\\'ve ever bought.  I saw the problem coming: during warranty period, a small headliner strap disconnected from the convertible top frame - it kept a section of headliner folding with the top.  A bit of superglue might have fixed that.  But no, the official service required a $1000 headliner replacement.  Just after warranty expired, my nice radio had trouble - the antenna broke.  Simple fix, right?  A $1000 replacement - much of the interior of the car needed removal to replace it.  Then, my AC went out.  After numerous trips to the dealer to add coolant, add fluorescent dye to find a leak:  the compressor needed replacement.  Turns out, that\\'s not a minor thing in an Audi.  The dealer quoted $6000.  I didn\\'t do it, so they worked around and \"disabled the compressor\".   Many more small things went out - like the headlight washer system blew a tiny cap - water everywhere; of course they don\\'t sell the caps, only the full $200/light washer.  That\\'s small for Audi.  Recently I started hearing a noise near the engine and took it for diagnosis: $700 just to remove enough for  inspection (from a 3rd party, probably a good price).  Something was throwing bolts out of the engine area!  It turns out, now the broken compressor was disintegrating, and was ready to take out other things too.  So, thousands more, now, forced to even keep the car driveable, and all this on a car with less than 62K miles on it.   AUDI:  Never again. Joy of S4 Simply a joy to own and to drive.  Handles every bit as well as the 2001 TT it replaced, and has 2.5 times the raw power. Wife\\'s MB-CLK430 not built as well nor does it have the smooth power delivery.  The S4 out corners and out powers it in head to head spirited driving. This Cab is perfect!! I have owned the cabriolet for a month now and I must say that it has far surpassed my expectations. The inside of the cabin is just beautiful. The car gets long glances all the time - on the highway, in parking lots, etc. Once you tune the sound system properly, it sounds amazing (the subpar sound had me worried for a while). Power is superb and visibility is not that bad for a Cab. Mileage can be poor if your foot is made of lead, but easy acceleration brings it back to average. But where\\'s the fun in that!!!  yessir that\\'s my baby Sometimes I believe my S4 leaves the road and soars through the air! It glides around corners, stops on a dime and is always willing to go faster than I am. It is beautiful and I still get excited everytime I slip in behind the wheel. Taking the top down on the freeway is wonderful. Sometimes I feel guilty about the as milage...but, well, what can I say, I\\'m in LOVE! S4 Cab,,,, the best of all worlds! Amazing looks, performance, comfort, \\rsafety, room for 4 real people, top-\\rdown fun and .... all-wheel drive!  The \\r6 spd. stick is precise with crisp, \\rshort throws.  Keeping engine rpms \\rbelow 4500 in this break-in period, but \\rthere is a ton of torque on hand in any \\rgear!  Can\\'t wait to \"air it out\".  \\rOrdered the car back in January and \\rtook delivery *exactly* when expected.\\rThe Light Silver Alcantra interior is \\rrich and luxurious and contrasts \\ragainst the Black trim beautifully.  \\rChose the optional Carbon-Fiber trim \\rrather than the dark brown walnut.  \\rOrdered mine Moro (dark) Blue with \\rmatching Blue top.  Car feels *very* \\rsolid, hugging the road. Love my new S4 Cabrio This car is quick off the line with \\rtrue appeal on turns.  The SMG paddle \\rshifters give the control of a stick \\rwithout the annoyance of a clutch in \\rtraffic.  Stereo is clear, seats are so \\rcomfortable.  This thing is just great \\rin turns and loves to jump off the line.\\rI had a 1999 Corvette and I like this \\rmore - can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this.\\rMine- brilliant red with silver/wood \\rinterior. Great Car  Never had any problems with it Hot S4 Convertible I just got my New Audi S4 Convertible  This One Does it All This is the perfect car if you don\\'t want to be seen in a \"sports car\".  Not to mention, you can haul a few kids along the way as well.  Although it is not as athletic as a Cayman, it will easily blow away your expectation as to what a grocery hauler can do.  It has the class inside and out as you\\'d expect from an Audi. The 4.2L V8 is a battle-tested dynamo in the lineup.  Sure, you can complain about the mileage, but don\\'t buy this car if that\\'s on the top of your list - high performance is what it is.  Although we haven\\'t used it to tow anything, it is our do it all car anytime of the year.  If you can find one (sedan or wagon), jump on it, you will be happy Uber wagon, year round satisfaction What a great year round vehicle!  Classy looks, classy interior, good handling, comfortable ride, 4 doors, wagon versatility, great power, all wheel drive, powerful brakes, and in my case, absolutely reliable, no problems.  This car offers a combination that few, if any can match.  Great engineering.  Get your M3s out of the barn in the Midwest during winter.  LOL    S4 Avant - A car to love Purchased my S4 Avant in July 07. Most enjoyable car I have owned.  It has utility but is refined and comfortable, the design and styling of the B6 model S4 is timeless.  The handling is incredible and effortless despite a 2 ton curb weight, 4 doors, a fully functional rear seat and a large wagon cargo area.  My fuel economy has averaged 17.8.  I have gotten as high as 21 in highway only driving. Not as bad as others suggest, but certainly no economy or hybrid. The acceleration certainly provides a more than adequate trade off.  The rear seat is comfortable for average adult passengers. Not as spacious as a full size (A6/8, 5/7series) but the other options don\\'t provide a V8 6 spd manual. One of my favorites Over the years I have owned a number of fast cars and this ranks as one of the best. I originally intended buying the sedan but ended up getting the wagon (with a 6 speed) which I think is even better looking and a bit more practical. The most camoflaged car on the road! Third child came/ TT had to go/wife \\rgot minivan and I got a world class \\rsports car disguised as a family \\rstation wagon.Audi builds great \\rexteriors(Black on Black)and even \\rbetter interiors(two-tone black/grey \\rAlcantara,Recaro seats,both front&back \\rseats).Bose concert sound is very nice \\rbut the throaty rumble of 340HP is \\reven nicer.Quattro lends confidence \\rthat even in the worst weather my \\rfamily is safer in the Avant than in \\rour minivan.A note about gas mileage \\rbig V8s can have big appetites \\respecially in city driving, however I \\rfound the highway gas mileage to be \\rcomparable to other V8s. sleeper wagon I think that this car was custom made for me \\rby the powers that be.  My husband knew he \\rwas sunk as soon as I sat in it! The wagon is \\rsuch a sleeper, just to see the look on the \\rfaces of the wanna be racers I blow away on \\rthe freeway makes me giddy.  Yet, the \\rwagon is extremely versatile.  I have 2 large \\rlabs that I cart around in the cargo space, \\rwith the seats up!  I take long trips with the \\rdogs and the car is super comfortable and \\rperforms in all types of weather.  The seats \\rhug you comfortably and overall the car\\'s \\rperformance it stellar.  I LOVE IT!!  Was \\rgonna hold out for the BMW545it, but glad I \\rdidn\\'t. Racecar fun, SUV utility and MPG I am one of the 10 Americans that LOVE \\rwagons and this one is as good as you \\rcan buy. I have the one from the ads, \\rblue w/ blue and black int. Looks \\rawesome. V8 is stellar! (especially \\rafter you add the APR complete exhaust \\rsys.) Great brakes (I might even leave \\rthem factory!) Decent suspension \\r(likely to upgrade) Downside: Even \\rbeing super nice I can\\'t get 20 MPG. Best Drive I have owned several Audis including two high end \\rwagons, a 200 Wagon and a 95 S6 Wagon, both \\rvery strong performing cars especially on the \\rhighway, but this car is at whole other level. \\rAlthough the other two wagons were turbos the \\r340 HP V8 in the S4 is far quicker in any gear at any \\rspeed, there is never any turbo lag, step on it and it \\rmoves. The S4 is a great highway drive, but it is \\ralso has a sporter feel that my older larger Audis. \\rFar and away the best car I have ever owned. I may \\rbuy a second. Oh What a Feeling!!! Unbelievable, smooth and powerful. A \\rjoy just to sit in and admire. \\rSmoothest tranny I have ever \\rexperienced. Not a day goes by where \\reither the color (Nogaro blue) or the \\rAlacantara recaro (blue) interior \\rdoesn\\'t get noticed by a passer-by! Rockin\\' Rocket of a 4-door! I\\'ve owned this car for about 2.5 \\rmonths and I still get excited \\reverytime I get in and crank it.  My \\rexitement hasn\\'t diminished a bit yet, \\rin fact it has grown as I have learned \\rto drive it (44yrs. old and never \\rshifted gears before can you believe).\\r This car is art.  It is an amazing \\rblend of ergonomic creature comfort, \\rgreat looks, 4-door functionality, and \\runbelievable performance.  It leaves \\rvery little left to add to the mix \\rsince it is so potent and so driveable.  Great Car with a Fatal Flaw Great fit and finish, great power but \\rwhat is it with the throttle response?  \\rSo much delay you can stomp to the \\rfloor and let off before anything \\rhappens. Worse than a turbo. When it \\rdoes finally get going it keeps on \\rgoing even after you start easing off.  \\rNot safe in a car with this much power! \\rGives new meaning to \"Unintended \\rAcceleration\".  Evaluate carefully \\rbefore you buy! red rocket will be buying 2018 s4   will miss manual and v8 sound    have 4 people who want this car     a tank in snow with blizzaks Joy Ride What an apsolute joy to drive one of these. I have an 04 with suspension, brakes, RS4 wheels, Milltek exhaust addons. Simple bolt ons, but i wouldnt put this kind of money into something i didn\\'t think was worth it. I am a total nerd/gear head when it comes to cars and this is only one of a few affordable cars i drool over. It\\'s not the fastest car. If a 911 turbo pulls up besides you, dont waste the fuel. But if one of those chump Mustangs try to pull the same crap (again. Dont waste your time and fuel), but be assure that if he\\'s dumb enough to challenge, you\\'ll take the cake. Rides like it\\'s on rails and screams through the corners. It makes a rumble that will cause earth quakes! AWD Rocket 2004 Audi S4 Manual 26K miles I\\'m 6\\' 250 lbs MaleWhat a blast to drive.I bought this low mile beauty above market and it was a joy to drive.Both it the city where I absolutely rocketed between stoplights and in the city where I flew around curves the Audi never stopped delighting me.I had the manual (which is why I had to sell it after only 2K miles due to a bad knee) which I imagine is more fun.It stuck to the road like it was glued.I never really drove it in the winter so the AWD was only tested in rain - it worked great.Absolutely a joy to drive unless stuck in traffic.I could not make myself go slow unless I was trapped in traffic.I replaced it with a Pontiac G8 GT. Buy with warranty or be ready to spend Pros : Performance is awesome, one of the best looking sport sedans , interior is spacious, sound system is great, fully loaded with options, very nice seats. Cons: 1) very poor reliability! So far : bearings, engine cover gaskets, coils, light sensors, seat warmers wiring, clutch!, control arm. I was not expecting that many issues with a car that I take good care of and I hardly overdrive it! Good thing all were covered by extended warranty. 2) MPG : 14 to 15 3) Front heavy due to engine weight I am reluctant to buy another Audi, although the S5 is hard to resist. I owned 328i BWM for 5 yrs I did not have any problems until around 100K miles,I started having problems with S4 at 30K mi Fairly Impressed Was looking for a 4 door with some grunt...domestics (Charger, Impala, etc) were garbage.  S4 head and shoulders above. This car gets after it. Seats are extremely supportive and engine growl is addicting. Hugs the road and begs for curves.  Don\\'t know if I would recommend for a commuter car.  Made more for crooked back roads.  Best looking car on road in my opinion and it\\'s 5 years old at this point! Averaging around 19 combined mpg--and that\\'s with me \"going easy\" on acceleration and driving a lot of interstate.  Like I said, not necessarily a commuter car or a car that\\'s going to attract a lot of attention (a good thing in my book!). Wish I had my 01 S4 back I so wanted to love this car after enjoying my 01 SO MUCH but although it\\'s fast and fun, the mpg is pathetic (my 01 averaged 18-22 but I got 33-36 on cruises in the Rockies) and electrical gremlins are numerous. Strut replacement at $2000 is obscene and why water dribbles out of the side panels days after a wash is pathetic. The Alcantara wears very badly. The perfect all around car I bought this car as a Audi CPO and only had it a few months but this is the car for me! By far the fastest car I ever owned! Not flashy yet very stylish and gives you the best all around performance. I can pick up my kid from school, plow threw snow and rain, yet take a Porsche Boxster! You start to smile as soon as you start this car up. The rumble of the V-8 is just amazing but it still is quite and refined when you drive at high speeds. The AWD not only helps in the snow but but makes the handling unbelieveable. Even if this car loses grib it quickly corrects itself and keeps you in control.  this is my first Audi so I just hope it is reliable because I want to keep it for a long time Supercar in a sedan! I just bought this car as a certified pre-owned. So far I love the car! It is so fast and comfortable to drive! All the luxury I can ever need and fast enough to keep up with most of the sports cars on the road. All with all wheel drive and 4 doors! I can take my daughter to school in it, go through bad weather or run it at the track. This car was made for a family guy like myself who doesn\\'t want to let go of the kid in them! Understated excellence I\\'ve owned my 2004 S4 for almost two years now (bought w/ 15k miles), sufficient time both to get over any new car puppy love and to notice any reliability issues.  Well, I\\'m still in love and the only reliability issue was a balky sunroof switch that was replaced under warranty.  At first glance, it appears to be a mild-mannered A4: solid German engineering in a conservatively styled sedan.  But once you\\'ve settled into a front seat that holds you tight and heard the V8 grumble to life, you know this is no A4.  A few corners at high speed and one highway on-ramp are all that\\'s needed to confirm that you\\'re driving an agile machine that carries speed deceptively well. Fun car to own and drive Car is an everyday car with performance, although a bit heavy.  Glad I bought it and has been worth it so far. No major repairs needed as with the other reviewers and I\\'m just under 30k miles and put 6k on when I bought it used.  Have run it through snow, sleet, and rain and it hasn\\'t failed me yet!  I would recommend this car if you\\'ve got income to spend on it snacking on fuel every opportunity it can get.  Never Follow I\\'m 22 and have now owned 3 audis. Loved my 2000 A6 2.7T for 3 years then looked to get a new Audi. Was first looking for a 2006 A8L which is such a great luxury sedan. I test drove a Dolpin Grey S4 as well on the lot and ever since never wanted to stop driving it. Can\\'t say enough about the whole package, engine is awesome and fit and finish as well. 04 S4 -Tremendous This car is fantastic.  Surefooted, easy to drive hard, fun, reliable and solid (read, safe).  The AWD and traction control make this a serious toy for us \"older\" kids.  And, when you think you\\'ve mastered it, turn off the traction control. A wolf in sheep\\'s clothing The S4 is the first Audi I have ever purchased, and it will definitely not be my last.  I have been a BMW fan for years, however, the interior design and class the S4 resembles cannot be matched by any current manufacturer.  Power is plentiful even at low RPMs, giving passing lanes a sort of GT feel rather than mundane city driving.  The grabby clutch did give me some issues during the first 1000kms, although the overall driving experience overcompensated for Audi\\'s slight imperfection.  My only major complaint is Audi waited so long to bring the RS4 stateside!  Oh well, I will just have to settle for the sluggish 340 hp, road gripping, eye catching juggernaut.  A tru1ely remarkable car. A versatile car in every way except... This vehicle is very versatile.  It isn\\'t the fastest car nor the sexiest nor the safest but it IS the best combination of all of these.  It is plenty fast, has very good looks, fit and finish, has all the safety features one could want such as curtain airbags and AWD, and has the ability to be usefull year round in northern climates.    What this car isn\\'t is reliable.  They are expensive to repair largely due to the very tight packaging constraints of fitting in the v8.  Common issues include clutches, valve cover gaskets, coilpacks, tensioner pullies, and starters.  In three months of ownership the car visited the dealership 4 separate times with a total of 2 thousand in repairs (warrantied). Great looker - very poor reliability This is my second S4 (I had a 2001 previously), and my 5th Audi. The design is great, interior elegant and ergonomic, and it performs great. But the reliability has been miserable. I only kept it for 6 months - it was in the shop every month of those 6 months. It went through brake rotors, had a coolant leak, an transmission cooler leak, the ABS system failed intermittently, and the check engine light came on (bad O2 sensors) twice. Probably the last Audi I\\'ll ever buy - sad really. Incredible Car!  Buy Certified! Went from E36 M3 to M Roadster to B5 S4 to E46 M3, and now this B6 S4.  What a difference!  The V8 is a torque monster compared to the M cars, and handling is every bit as sharp and confidence-inspiring.  Interior can\\'t be beat, and Bose stereo works well.  I think Audi\\'s nav system has a contract with the oil companies, as this thing will re-route you all over the country.  Passing power is awesome, but clutch engagement is very tricky.  Highly recommended, as long as you don\\'t live in a city.  City MPG is between 9-13!  The fun factor is worth every gallon however.   Awesome S4 The S4 is a very smooth and powerful car.  The build quality is excellent and the interior is beautiful.  The torque range is very good and linear.  I would like a little more steering feel and a little less body roll through tight turns.  I love the exhaust note and turn off the stereo just to hear it(even though the stereo is excellent).  I have a Porsche Boxster S which I love; this car is great, just different.  It is an awesome car which works as a daily driver except for the gas mileage. Audi S4 - Hard to Beat! Leased silver sedan with automatic trans in October 2003. Car has 35,000 miles. It is truly a driver\\'s car - on windy, country roads, it handles as well as my Porsche 911. The handling is superior as are the brakes and ride quality. Reliability has been a bit of an issue - transmission had to be replaced - would have cost in excess of $6500 if car had not been under warranty. In short, if you can accept the extremely mediocre gas mileage, and want to carry 4 in relative comfort, and you want a smile on your face every time you drive, this is the machine. 911 Beater This is one sensational automobile. Leased S4 automatic from local dealer in October 2004 and have been smiling ever since. The performance and handling are superb; very close to my 2004 Porsche 911 C2 in terms of fun to drive quotient over windy, country roads. My spouse, who wanted an A6, uses the S4 to commute and loves its size and superior handling and power. The suspension is compliant/ A true sports sedan! Super in winter with a set of 4 snow tires. Downside: fuel economy is atrocious - under 15 mpg around town. But when lease expires in April \\'07, we have already decided to get another. Love Audi\\'s bumper to bumper warranty and service from local dealer. The intelligent mans supercar!  Absolutely awesome performance. Does everything well or better than my last Porsche 911. Fit and finish is excellent and build materials are the best at any price range. Driving the S4 at low or extreme high speeds feels efforlessly with comfort and composure. The quattro makes a good driver a great driver and makes up for mistakes that would normally put a 911 in the bushes.  The two-tone silver suede and leather Recaro seats are the best in the hi-performance industry. The motor pulls stong down low and doesnt let up to its 7200rpm redline. Its a cross between a 911 and muscle car.  I cant say enough about the new S4. Its in its own league when compairing other extreme sport sedan. I Can\\'t Wait to Drive My S4 I\\'ve never owned a car where I actually looked forward to driving it. This S4 has changed that. Driving it is truly enjoyable. The Recaro seats keep you firmly in place.  I know there are faster cars and better handling but the overall experience in the S4 is one of the best. I wake up everyday excited to drive it. This is my only car and it fills all my needs without ever complaining.  My best analogy for this car would have to be the story, \"Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\".  When needed, the car will get you to and from work, run errands, cruise across the country, whatever, all in a surprising amount of comfort.  But, when you desire to have some fun with the car, it seems to transform into an absolute beast!  It will pin you into the seat and scare the hell out of your passengers!  Admittedly, the M3 performs slightly better in some categories, but it\\'s also a VERY high-strung car, not nearly as comfortable to drive on a daily basis. Audi S4 - great fun car!! As the title suggests, I feel that this is a great car to drive.  It\\'s fun, has a great exhaust note (especially with my aftermarket exhaust) and provides for a very balanced driving experience.  It might not be the fastest car out there for the money, but it provides for one of the best overall packages (quality of interior, performance, versatility, etc). Eager Power - Needs more fun-to-drive. Great ride - I\\'m a 4X BMW and former TT (225hp) owner. Love the power, stealth and sound. Went to Audi after BMW \\'Banglized\\' and moved the clutch release point to top of throw. The S4 borders on a true driver\\'s car. A very stable platform, wonderful, thrilling, power and great sounds. But misses on the fun-to-drive factor. AWD? - the thrill of the corner is not there.  Almost oh-hum.  There\\'s a corner on my way home that takes \\'skill\\' to traverse at speed.  528i-76 mph (thrilling), TT- 82 MPH (fun), S4-88 MPH stock rubber, 92 with better rubber - but no thrill. Seems like I live at the gas pump.  Why do Audis have to be reprogrammed for keybob actuation of windows remote up/down. Best overall!!!! Fun, fast and high quality. All Weather Ripper Beat you on the track or on the way to Squaw Valley.  Great for Urban driving as well as interstate cruises and backroad burning.  Only design flaw: Failure of interior light dimmer to work sufficiently! S4 Pure Fun ZOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM This is an incredible ride. My first Audi but not my last. I was amazed at the handling. The (4.2L V8) 340 hp and 18/8 wheels matched with the AWD make for unbeliveable handling. Honest 0-60 in 5 seconds. The steering is so responsive it takes some practice. The fit and finish of both the interior and exterior are amazing. Bought it used Have only had the car (2004 S4 sedan) for a few weeks, but I love it so far! I bought it used with high mileage for a 1 year old car. But it runs great, and as every other owner has said, lots of fun to drive, extra power in all gears, and 4WD to boot. I test drove a BMW 330xi, but compared to the 330ci it just didn\\'t seem to have the same power. A better comparison to the S4 would be the M3xi -- oh, but there\\'s no such thing! ;) My S4 My 2004 Audi S4 is a great car! I had a 2000 S4 for four years and 50,000 without experiencing any problems.  It was fun to drive all year long. The 2004 is even better. Everything has been improved. A  RUSH TO DRIVE THE 2004 S4  I looked around for a hi-power engine stuffed in a small car. The M3 came only in 2 door/stick shift and the AMG didnt have the sporty looks and ride. The S4 has awesome power. I can hardly touch the gas pedal and this baby leaps forward. Cornering is easy to stick as all 4 wheels deliver gobs of power to the road.  The ride is stiff (I prefer in a performance car) but so stable and smooth. This car doesnt wake up until at least 80 mph+ and it rides better as you go faster. Have had the S4 to 140 mph out in the country and felt like more power was available. Recaro seats are comfy for long rides. And of course, the rumble of the pipes catches the attention of folks nearby.  Awesome car!!! Phenominal The S4 is the most fun car I have ever driven  The engine is a beast, with power through the entire range.  I chose between the S4 and an M3, I\\'ve never looked back. Never thought I\\'d love it! I have owned three BMW\\'s, an Acura, a \\rMercedes-Benz, and most recently an Infiniti \\rG35 Coupe.  I never even considered \\rbuying an Audi until I almost died in \\rmy RWD Infiniti last winter in the \\rsnow. So, trying to be conservative, I \\rbought the S4. All I can say is HOLY \\rCOW!!!  The thing is a rocket ship in \\rsheep\\'s clothing.  In sport mode, there \\rare few people who can take you at a \\rstop sign.  It handles far better than \\rany of my RWD cars and it feels very \\rsafe.  Haven\\'t had much snow this year \\ryet, but with the winter wheels on, I \\rdon\\'t anticipate any problems.  Can\\'t \\rsee why I\\'d ever buy anything else. Would Do It Again I waited six months to receive my Audi S4\\rafter I ordered it and it was worth the\\rwait.  This car does pretty much\\reverything well.  It\\'s a very timeless\\rdesign that will not get old.  Very\\rsubtle but also a hint of restrained\\ragressiveness.\\r The Recaro seats are sublime and the\\rinterior is about as close to perfect as\\rI\\'ve seen.  It seats four very comfortably\\rand I\\'ve taken several long trips with\\rteenagers in the back.  No complaints\\rother than no integrated DVD ;-)\\r The power is perfect and is delivered\\rthrough Audi\\'s quattro.  This V8 is very\\rsmooth and powerful.  The power delivery\\ris very linear and it\\'s hard to keep \\rthe speeds down, even when I am trying.\\r The only downside?  Gas mileage. German Muscle Car The Audi S4 is an awesome handling car: quattro, speed\\rsensitive steering, & suspension w/\\rlightweight components.  Its interior is top\\rnotch, Better than the BMW M3\\'s.  Its gearbox is\\rexcellent and the clutch is kind of soft. The V8\\rrumble sounds better than a raspy inline\\r6.  I was deciding between this car and an M3\\rand picked the S4 because it has 4-doors, a V8 engine,\\ra superb interior, and the better gearbox.\\rI have nearly 20,000 miles on it already and have not \\rhad a single problem.  The car runs like a\\rdream and has gobs of power throughout\\rall the gears.   Best Christmas Present I have Ever Had I have not stopped smiling for 5 days \\rsince I purchased my 2005 S4. This car \\rhas everything I have ever dreamed of \\rin terms of style , gadgets , comfort \\r& power. Traded my BMW and would not \\rgo back for any amount of money. If \\ryou are in the market for a \\rperformance car you would be a fool if \\ryou didn\\'t try the S4. Gas Mileage I \\rcan see is going to be low but with \\rthe power pack returning 340 bhp who \\rcares. Drive it you\\'ll love it Performance and luxury This car is the ultimate combination of \\rsports and luxury.  While it\\'s not \\rquite as sporty as BMW\\'s M3, it is far \\rmore comfortable.  Not to mention that \\rquattro makes it a true year-round \\rpractical performance car. S4 ups and downs Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed my \\rS4. Driving 25,000 mi / yr, the car has \\rbeen an excellent performer -- the \\rpower, handling, and comfort level are \\rall very nicely blended and what I\\'m \\rlooking for in this market. \\rUnfortunately a major issue developed. \\rMy car was in for its routine 25,000 \\rservice when an occult oil leak was \\rdetected. Apparently, there is \\ra \"watch\" out on the engine where \\rsome \"O ring\" and sealant may need to \\rbe replaced (so I was told). Now, my \\rcar is in for sevice for a minimum of \\rtwo weeks for the engine to be removed \\rand repaired. This certainly took a \\rtoll on my confidence with Audi \\rreliability.  The car I\\'ve been waiting for... I bought mine at a huge discount \\rbecause it was a dealer buy-\\rback.  Apparently, some earlier \\rS4\\'s had engine & tranny \\rproblems, so mine got a new engine and \\ra new transmission with \"bug\" fixes, \\rand now the car runs perfectly.  The \\rprevious owner should have kept it, \\rbecause I am now enjoying a flawless \\rvehicle!\\rWe all know about the super \\rperformance and the bad gas mileage, \\rso let\\'s get past that and talk about \\rwhat a great stealth vehicle this car \\ris. I also own a heavily modified \\rMitsu Eclipse GSX that is a \"Fast and \\rFurious\" type vehicle, but my S4 \\routperforms it, and has quiet \"class\" \\ras well.  With the premium package, \\rthis car is tops!  M3? Humbug! 04 S4 Review Coming from a 02 BMW 3 series, I have \\rhigh expectations, and I have to say, \\rthe solid, tutonic build quality of \\rthis auto is amazing. Quieter, a touch \\rsofter although still very stiff and \\raccurate, this car rocks. Really \\renjoying it. There is no other choice! If you live in the northeast, as I do, \\rthere is no other choice for under \\r$60k.  I have been caught in blizzards \\rwith this car and had no problems.     \\rI might have considered the M3,  but \\rwhat do you do when it snows? Stay \\rhome?   I have taken bends in the \\rhighway at over 100 mph (after \\rdownshifting to 5th gear),  \\rand not gotten nervous or felt any \\rlateral movement.   People in \\rtheir \"fast and the furious\" cars \\ralways try keep up with me.   So far I \\rhaven\\'t had anyone come close.... S4 Civilized Power If you\\'re part of the WRX-STI or EVO \\rcrowd, the S4 is not for you!! The S4 \\rcomes with power to spare, but it comes \\rin an elegant and well behaved package. \\rIt is gutsy, yet balanced and \\rpredictable.  While handling is not \\rquite M3 like, you will rarely miss \\rit.  It\\'s throaty roar pleases when \\ryour alone, but you can also take the \\rfamily for a Sunday drive.\\r Overall, it is the finest automobile I \\rhave ever owned. A must test drive  If your in the market comparing M3 and \\rthe C55 AMG, you must drive this car.\\rEasier drive than the M3, and not as \\rshowy as the C55. (sometimes you don\\'t \\rwant people to know what you have).\\rQuattro makes any roadway feel safe and \\rstable, and V8 makes this car move. One Happy Guy Test drove several Mercedes, owned two\\rBMWs, this car is about the perfect\\rbalance for me.  I prefer the more\\rimmediate steering feel of a BMW,\\rhowever Audi has done a great job with\\rthe steering in this car. (All wheel\\rdrive prevents it being any better.)  I\\ralso perfer rear wheel drive, but this\\rcar doesn\\'t have the obnoxious front\\rwheel drive feel most AWD cars provide.\\rThe power is great fun, the ride\\rexceptional given the performance\\renvelope of the car.  I can\\'t find fault\\rwith the interior, & actually love the\\rstealthy exterior.  A BMW M3 may be\\rquicker, but not by much, and the\\rride is much worse.  Don\\'t buy a\\rperformance sedan without test driving\\ran S4. fun, comfortable, rocket I traded in an A4, which I loved, for \\rthis car, but this car is in another \\rleague from any other car I have ever \\rdriven or owned.  The engine is just \\runreal.  It pulls from any RPM.  The \\rhandling is sublime and the interior \\ris just beautiful.  Every time I drive \\rthis car it puts a smile on my face. Little Rocket This was quite an upgrade from the 2000 \\rS4 2.7 Turbo I owned before.  This car \\ris nothing but fun to drive (except in \\rrush hour traffic).  Besides the ride \\rof the car, it\\'s also a very classy \\rlooking car (I love the chrome \\rmirrors).  I have yet to meet an M3 \\rdriver who isn\\'t impressed with this \\rS4.  I recommend this car to anyone \\rconsidering it. audii Audi S4 is a great car all the way  Stable rocketry! Quite simply put, one of the most \\rstable rides out there. An incredibly \\rwell thought out machine at a price \\rpoint that makes more \\rexpensive \"comparable\" cars in class \\rappear laughably over-valued.\\rAsk any German national, by the way, \\rwhich of the big three manufacturers \\rcranks out the finest auto and without \\rfail, they\\'ll say Audi (I\\'ve tested \\rthis on several occasions). Do yourself \\ra favor and at least take an S4 for a \\rtest drive. Why has no one heard of the S4? I had an \\'03 A4 CVT (hated CVT) and \\rupgraded to my S4.  I actually laughed \\rout loud the first time I drove it.  \\rAn amazing car.  The sound of the \\rengine alone makes you want to get \\rbehind the wheel.  The all-wheel drive \\rprovides a secure feeling around \\rcorners.  Design-wise, no domestic, \\rBMW or Benz or Japanese car even \\rcompares.  I had a Nogaro blue with \\renhanced black/blue interior.  The \\rseats \"hug\" you and makes you feel \\rsecure while driving. 2004 V8 vs. 2001 Biturbo I traded in my 2001 S4 biturbo for a \\r2004 6-spd. The 2004 is very quick \\r(with MT clocking a 5 second 60 MPH  \\rsprint, versus the factory\\'s 5.6 \\rest.), with an incredibly usuable \\rtorque curve. Unlike the 2001, there \\ris no lag in acceleration, and it \\rpulls hard from 2k RPM all the way to \\r5k before tailing off--you don\\'t \\rhave to work the engine hard to bring \\ra smile to your face. The torque \\ris noticeable on the highways as well, \\rwhere 60-90 MPH sprints pass by in a \\rblur. Minuses--Fit and finish is \\rpoorer, mileage is terrible, harsh \\rride (esp. if you live in the NE), \\radaptive steering and handling \\rgenerally can be irritating. Gripes \\rare small.So far I love it. Fun but on second engine Great car, lots of fun, much quicker \\rthan previous S4, but reliability very \\rpoor, had to have engine replaced \\rwithin first month.  Quality otherwise \\rvery impressive, could get better \\rmileage but with a car like this, who \\rcares.  Sealer service dept great, but \\rrest of dealership experience \\rterrible.  Audi America has work to do. If you have the means... Each piece is done just right:  \\rglorious motor, slick gearbox, fabulous \\rseats, sharp styling, all the creature \\rcomforts.  This car is just incredible \\rto drive. S4 vs M3, I have both S4 is soooo much more the total \\rpackage.\\rHow can anyone drive an M3 and an S4 \\rand really like the M3 , unless they \\rplan on driving at the track. I am \\rstill not sure the M3 will beat it. \\rAnd it will take so much effort \\rtrying. That\\'s the difference. And you \\rdon\\'t feel like a \"hood\" driving an S4.\\rIt just goes and sounds great doing it. Joy to Drive This car puts a smile on my face \\reverytime I get behind the wheel. It \\ris not only fun to drive with its all- \\rwheel drive \"quattro\" system, but also \\rhas the performance matching its \\rhandling. The tiptronic transmission \\ris wonderful with smooth shifts, and \\rif you want to shift manually, the \\rpaddle shifters are great behind the \\rsteering wheel. The engine has a \\rwonderful sound and I love to drive \\rthe car without the stereo on just to \\rlisten to it.  It looks great both \\rinside and out. This is what Porsche \\rwould have built, if you could buy a \\rsedan from them. 2004 S4 Brilliant Black great every day performance car.  With \\rproper tires, a capable winter car.  \\rVery linear power delivery, well \\rbalanced handling, and suspension that \\rworks with the driver. S4Joy This is my daily commuting car(110 \\rmiles r/t), and it is very sporty and \\rhandles exceptionally well.The \\rsuspension is stiff but the comfort of \\rthe seats more than makes up for \\rthat.It\\'s great for a short haul or a \\rmulti-hour drive even though the back \\rseat is a bit tight.The \\rinterior/exterior build quality is \\rexcellent.The gas mileage is a bit \\rworse than I had initially expected at \\ran avg of 14mpg. With this much torque \\rand HP one could easily drive this car \\rin 6th gear most of the time where I \\rsee 18mpg+, but the lower gears make \\rfor a lot of fun!The Quattro system is \\rjust as good as I remember from my old \\rA4. Amazing. Audi wasn\\'t even in my vocabulary when I\\rwent to look for a new car but I passed\\rit  walking out to test drive a few\\rPorsche vehicles and thought, what a\\rbeautiful understated car. I went out in\\rthe Porsche and went back and said lets\\rtake the S4 out. Needless to say 100mph\\rthrough a cloverleaf with no traction\\rloss and I was sold. Its a beautiful car\\rinside and out my ONLY complaint is the\\rcupholder in the dash stinks. My Track Car I raced this car stock and it far \\rexceeded my expectations.  Zero brake \\rfade, like the old model had.  Tourqe \\rfrom all speeds, I constantly skip \\rgears when I normally drive, it has \\rmore power than it really would ever \\rneed. s4 review Car is the ultimate in luxury and  The New Standard I have to say the new S4 is the most \\rcomplete package available.  Audi has \\rmastered doing everything well: \\rexcellent fit/finish, top notch \\rperformance, class-leading crash \\rtests, and the price is right.  Just \\rfeel the materials, touch buttons, \\ropen and close things. Top Gear in \\rEngland ran the S4 around a track a \\rfull one second faster than the M3 (1 \\rsecond is an eternity in racing).  It \\rwas nearly on pace with the Lambo \\rMurcielago.  So don\\'t think you\\'re \\rgetting less of a sports car than the \\rM3.  It\\'s actually quicker and a bit \\rmore refined.  Best car I\\'ve ever \\rowned. Stonking engine I have been totally delighted with my \\rS4.  Its supremely well built, handles \\rsuperbly and is great fun to drive - \\respecially on quieter roads where you \\rcan race through the gears.  But be \\rwarned, this is not just a fast German \\rlimo; its a serious handling lump and \\rthe drive can be quite \"involving\".  \\rThat could mean tiring to some.  The \\rsuspension is *firm* and on poor roads \\rat speed, you will be thrown around a \\rbit.\\r Taming the vast amount of torque \\rthrough the manual gearbox takes some \\rpractice too - smooth changes are not \\rto be taken for granted!\\r But overall, a fabulous car The Audi Beast This is my third Audi and it so far \\rabove the others, its in its own \\ratmosphere.\\r Bought it and put close to six thousand \\rmiles on it in two months. Freeways, \\rMountain passes, clogged city streets-\\rthe big Audi Beast (it even sounds like \\rone) handled everything with polish, \\rpower and grace. The Recaro seats do an \\rexcellent job on nall day interstae \\rcruises or back road burning.\\r The 2004 S4 truly does it all. Just be \\rprepared to pay at the pump as the \\rthirsty V8 really drinks deep. S4 -  Audi\\'s Premier Sports Sedan This is one super automobile. Car is 4 \\rmonths old with about 7500 miles. \\rPerformance is outstanding even with \\rthe 6 speed Tiptronic. Handling is \\rsuperior with the 18 in tires. Car is a \\rsmallish, tight rocket ship with 340 hp\\rand a V8 engine. Recaro seats are \\rsuperb. Fit and finsih are superb. On-\\rStar Telematics with built in phone is \\ra real plus. S4 is expensive, but on \\rbalance, worth it. Unless you can \\rafford the RS6, this is the car to go \\rwith. Forget the M3, go for the S4 with \\rawd. MY AUDI S4 IS AWESOME I had been waiting for my lease to end \\rand have been holding out for a car \\rthat offered performance, 4 doors, and \\rall- wheel drive.\\rThe M3 only has 2 doors and a manual \\rtranny; The AMG lacks some sportiness, \\rbody style is ok but unassuming, also \\rcosts more too.\\rThis car hauls and the all-wheel drive \\rmakes the tires power all 4 wheels \\rwhile gripping the road like glue.  The \\rtires are special continental 18 inch \\rhigh performance tires that came with \\rthe car and are specially tested and \\rmatched to the audi S4 at the factory.\\r   Now, THIS is FUN! What power, what handling.  The car \\rI\\'ve waited for...THE CAR! Happy So much fun to drive.  Was looking at \\rthis and the M3, but thought 333 horses \\rwith rear wheel drive in the snow would \\rbe a nightmare. Quattro was the only \\rway to go.  Looks great, not obnoxious, \\rbut has a noticably sportier look than \\rthe A4.  The seats are phenomenal and I \\rreally like the controls.  Was a bit \\rput off by lack of a navigation screen, \\rso skipped the GPS option.  Gas milage \\ris atrocious, but all that torque helps \\ryou to forget about it.  The combo of \\rpower and handling makes this the \\rfunnest car to drive that I have ever \\rowned. BMW M who? This Car has it all, Speed, Handling,\\rStyle, Comfort, and practicality.  I\\rfeel it is just a fast as an M3 or a C\\r32, but runs circles around the other\\rtwo in every other category.  The M3 is\\rtoo rough around curves and lack the\\rS4\\'s smooth grip and the C32 just stinks\\rin the handling category.  That V8\\rrumble is so much better than the BMW\\rWhine and the style and practicality\\rwith the AWD are miles ahead of the other 2. Best Sports Sedan, Hands Down I\\'ve had the car for 2 months and I\\'m\\rloving every minute of it.  The V8\\rreally gives you linear, almost\\rlimitless power!  It doesn\\'t \"seem\" as\\rfast as the old B5 S4 (chipped), but it\\rreally is faster.  Turbo gives you the\\rillusion you are accelerating quicker,\\rwhich is not always the case.  Audi\\rmakes fantastic cars.  They are sporty,\\rall-weather capable, and luxurious.   \\rNot noisy, rough \\'n rugged like the E46\\rM3.  The S4 has better fit/finish,\\rmaterials quality and a more luxurious\\rfeel than the M3.  That\\'s why I chose\\rthe S4.   IT\\'S GOOD THIS IS THE BEST CAR, I HAVE NEVER \\rBOUGHT A BRAND NEW CAR. NOR WOULD I \\rTRADE IT FOR ANYOTHER. YOU REALLY HAVE \\rTO TAKE ONE FROM YOUR DEALERSHIP FOR \\rTWENTY FOUR HOURS TO FULLY APPRECIATE \\rIT. A V8 is the difference This car is amazing.  I looked at the \\rZ06 and the M3 SMG2.  The power is \\rthere on all 3 of them, but the build \\rquality is really only there on the \\rS4.  The V8 makes all the difference \\rin this car.  It sounds incredible.  \\rThe handling is there, and not quite \\ras rough as the M3 or Vette.  I LOVE \\rIT! :o) Q car Great \"Wolf in sheeps clothing \" car. \\rDoes not get much notice (except in the \\rknow car enthusiasts).  Great V-8 \\r6speed combo german  muscle car Dear car lovers iam fortunate to have \\rowned over  15 new cars in the last 15 \\ryears.Xkrs,A8l,lotus,540i....\\rThis s4 is solid ,fast,fun and the \\rquality and looks of these new audis in \\rmy opinion is leaving bmws  behind \\rslowly but surely.It seems these guys \\rat edmunds are afraid to admit this? 2004 Audi S4 - Wow! Thia car is a phenomenal machine. \\rPower, handling and stability are \\rextraordinary. Audi, unlike Mercedes \\rand BMW, is a bit under the radar \\rscreen which I like. Had to invest \\r$1500 in snow tires and wheels but it \\rwas money well spent. We are a two Audi \\rfamily (also 2002 l.8T/manual. Hard to \\rbeat the S4 as a package - a bit tight \\rin the rear but a true sports sedan \\rwith AWD. Given current financial \\rincentives, I would recommend purchase \\rover lease. It ain\\'t cheap, but if you \\rcan afford it, it\\'s the only way to go! If I built a dream car from scratch ... ....it would be an S4. I can name 5 \\rsports cars I would love to have. You \\rcan\\x92t get groceries in them. Forget a \\rbaby seat. If you only drive when its \\rsunny, get an exotic. The S4 is an \\rexotic for every day. The genius is in \\rthe etails. The Recarro seats.  Cabin \\rstorage everywhere but out of sight. A \\rmotor that sings. Just test drive it. \\rNothing compares. A sports car you can \\rlive with... put a baby seat in... \\rtake a spin around the racetrack. (not \\rin that order)  I just got one for my \\rwife to replace a 94 Audi 90 with \\r199,730 miles (still running strong). \\rI am jealous. If I needed car I would \\rbuy another S4. A V8 is the difference It came down to the S4, M3 SMG2, and \\rZ06.  In the end the fit and finish of \\rthe S4 was superior to the M3, and \\respecially the Vette.  The M3 is nice, \\rand fast to be sure, but the feature \\rcontent is lacking as opposed to the \\rS4.  The V8 is much more linear than \\rthe twin-turbo V6 of the old S4.  I am \\rvery happy I chose the S4 and have no \\rregrets. It eats BMWs for breakfast !!! My last 4 cars were BMWs, including an \\rE6 M3.  The S4 runs circles around all \\rof them.  Great V8 engine, 6-speed \\rgearbox and all-wheel drive.  Beautiful \\rNogaro blue color with black \\rleather/blue alcantara seats - \\rstunning.  It took a little while to \\rlearn how to launch it smoothly in 1st \\rgear, but now that I can, it is \\rblindingly fast.  145 mph feels like 90 \\rmph in any other car.  I will never go \\rback to BMWs, which have gotten so \\rugly.  The only question you should ask \\ryourself when you go car shopping \\ris \"What is the best Audi I can \\rafford?\"  I hope your answer is \"S4.\" It\\'s my 4th and the best, I find myself just taking off on the  One Fast Ride At only 700 miles so far, I love this \\rcar.  Power at all levels; classy, top \\rnotch interior; great seats.  This car \\rreally moves, is great looking inside \\rand out, and is a joy to drive.  Tight \\rsuspension a bit bumpy for the everyday \\rdriver. audi\\'s rule they are great cars My Awesome car I\\'ve had over 24 cars. Most of them \\rbeing sports cars and the Audi S4s my \\rfavorite. I was in an accident two \\ryears ago and totalled my S4. I hit a \\rcement wall at 70mph head on and was \\rnot injured or even sore ( my ego was \\rhurt,but that was it) I turned around \\rand order the same car again. It\\'s very \\rsafe and it\\'s so much fun to drive. It \\rgets looked at and the thumbs up while \\rI\\'m driving down the road. I love my \\rAudi. S4 Review  I have always owned Audi\\'s i traded in  4 doors, 340 horse power, life is good! What a great car! Tight, fast, great \\rrumble, 4-doors- the ultimate wolf in \\rsheeps clothing! Handling is excellent \\rand the torque is ever present! The \\rreviewer who gave it 5.5 stars must \\rnot have been hugged as a child! The \\rm3 is a great car  but so is this S4. \\rI would take the M3 if I autocrossed \\rfrequently but for everyday driving in \\rthe northeast 4 season weather, the S4 \\ris my choice. Awesome! This is an excellent car, overall.  It \\rlooks great, the build quality and fit \\rand finish are top-notch, the Audi \\rinterior/ergonomic designers have \\routdone themselves, and the 4.2L V8 \\rperformance is incredible, as is the \\rsteering, suspension, and quattro-\\renhanced handling.  This car is a \\rtruly an elegant sleeper! Amazing car for the price... The car is incredible.  Super fast, \\rtons of amenities, superb build \\rquality, blows most other cars off the \\rroad. RocketShip I have been an Audi Lover all my life.  \\rI waited a year for this car and well \\rworth it.  I was the first to drive the \\rcar off the lot and have been getting \\rlooks ever since.  The car has amazing \\rtorque.  Handling is unbelievable.  Gas \\rmileage is a bit of a burn, yet all it \\rtakes is a good release of all 340 \\rhorses and you quiclky forget the trip \\rmade to the pump.  Eat your heart out \\rM3 lovers. The 2004 S-4 is a Solid Success The 2004 S-4 has the best across-the-\\rboard torque I have ever experienced.  \\rAcceleration is superior even in sixth \\rgear.  The shifter is quick and \\rprecise, and the exhaust note is \\rthunderous (though not for anyone who \\rthinks a quiet, serene ride is a high \\rpriority).  Handling is outstanding and \\rride quality is refined without \\rcompromising the tautness and road feel \\rexpected from a performance sport sedan. Highly recommend buying I also got one of the first cars \\ravailable.  The power is available at \\ranytime and comes on smooth and \\rconsistent.  The seats are the best I \\rhave ever seen, and the car just begs \\rto be driven and driven hard.  I find \\rit hard not to grab the keys and head \\rfor the twisties everytime I look at \\rit.  The S4 is surprisingly a very \\rcomfortable ride without the harsh and \\rpunishing rides often associated in \\rthis class of car.  I feel I could \\rdrive this car across the country \\rwithout a single complaint from me or \\rmy passenger.  The V-8 rumble is \\rirresistable to the ears! Tremendous Car Had the car 3 days.  Wow, what a car, \\rdon\\'t want to get out of it.  Own 98 \\rcobra as well and this car moves, but \\rwith serious class.  Styling is \\rimpeccable with the aluminium trim and \\rleather/suede seats.  Ride is very \\rfirm, but not jarring and holds the \\rroad like glue.  Felt very safe in \\rdrive home in the snow. Beautiful and Fast I just purchased my 2004 Dolphin Gray S-\\r4 with the premium and XM infotainment \\rpackages and I love it.  The car \\rhandles, looks and sounds like a \\rdream.  You can take turns like you \\rwouldn\\'t imagine.  The color is \\rbeautiful.  I enjoy driving it more \\rthan my friends convertible 2003 M3 and \\rhave the advantage of 4 doors.  You can \\rreally feel the difference a V-8 makes.  Not Close to an M3 Wide console rubs my kneecap \\rconstantly. Navigation system not \\raccessible by navigator.  No moving \\rmap.  Just \\'directions\" on a 2X2 screen \\rfor a $1500 option.  Wife\\'s 1997 M3 \\rgets 50% more mileage with same \\rpickup.  Torque-steer on front wheels \\rannoying. Harsh ride.  Gave back to \\rdealer to sell with less than 400 miles \\ron it.  Will keep M3.  A horrible car.   Power and the beauty of all wheel drive This car has great power!  Alhtough it \\ris rather heavy, but is very balance \\rthrough corners and lane change.   The new S4 Awesome car.  It has lived up to every \\rpromise that Audi has made.  The V8 \\rpower combined with the all wheel drive \\rhandling combine to make quite a \\rthrilling ride.  The exhaust note \\ris \"evil\" sounding and adds even more \\radrenaline when you punch it.\\r If you can find one, I\\'d buy it.    Bahn burner Waited three months, and it was worth \\rit. The build quality on this car is \\ramazing. Everything is clean, tight, \\rand in the right place. The car has a \\rgreat rumble and is always ready \\rto \"launch\" - not to mention the brakes \\rare incredible. I looked at the C32 \\r(need 4 doors), and no comparison to \\rquality. The seats are the best I have \\rever felt in a car. Best four door \\runder $70,000 (AMG E55). Blazing speed This car is a 10 all around. Best in B-segment. More versatile than an M3 and more \\rsporting character than a C32 AMG and \\rS60R...Car and Driver likes it better \\rthan the M3 and C32, and so do I. If \\ryou want a smooth rocket-ship with \\rplenty of torque on tap for just about \\ranything you want to do, it\\'s there. \\rQuattro handles like a dream and the \\rcar looks awesome. Awesome!!!!! I was lucky to get one of the first  fully pleased with my S4 Added a transmission chip for my  So much that is so right, yet! Overpriced but delightful companion. An over-rated Audi Audi should never even offer an automatic transmission in a car like this...even the Tiptronic.  Aside from being \"clunky,\" after 8,000 miles mine has been in the shop going on 3 weeks because it will no longer shift gears!  The right rear brake make an ear shattering squeal and they can\\'t seem to fix that either.  The brakes are awful on the smallest amount of ice or snow. There is an unacceptable number of squeaks, rattles and buzzes inside.  And, even though a small point, two of the cup holders are underneath the armrest...very handy!  I guess Germans don\\'t drink and drive. For the price, extreme disappointment is all I can say about this vehicle. Simply a Blast! Great vehicle!  First Audi I\\'ve owned.  Comfortable, fast and not too flashy.  Was looking for an A8 at the time.  Came across the S4 and drove it home.  So far, the most fun vehicle I\\'ve owned and seems to be as reliable as a Benz.  The only qualm is the cost of service is as expensive as Jags.  Fortunately it\\'s never in shop though but for the scheduled intervals (every 10000 miles... awesome!).  I\\'ve come to the conclusion that the next vehicle upgrade will be for another S4! One great Audi! This is an all around great car. It\\'s an absolute blast to drive, and you can blow away most cars you\\'ll encouter at the red light on your way home from the grocery store. Plus, it\\'s just a little bit different, which is always good. Low quality performer I couldn\\'t be happier with the stock performance of this car. The price to performance and features ratio of this car can\\'t be beat, and simple upgrades can make this car truly track ready. In the Northeast or snowy climes, no car on the road can touch it (B6 S4 and RS 6 aside). But quality, reliability, and dealer service is absolutely brutal. Electrical system problems are Audi\\'s specialty, but I have also had problems with everything from rattles to rivets popping to coolant pumps failing to leather spalling to ... Service quality and knowledge from dealers is poor (e.g. Audi service does not feel it\\'s necessary to rotate tires).  Best all around car I recently went through the experience of having our 1st child and after 6 months realized that a stable of 2 Porsches wasn\\'t working very well.   I have always been a Porsche fanatic and owned a 930 turbo and a Boxster.  Knowing that I needed to buy a more practical car but realizing I wouldn\\'t be happy with less performance, I stumbled across the Audi S4.  This car is the very best all around car that is on the market.  It offers a stock 250hp twin turbo engine (which can easily be tuned to 310hp) with a max torque at 1850rpms.  This thing shoots off the line and handles corners like a Porsche.  It\\'s also very comfortable, fits a baby seat in the backseat, has 4 doors, huge trunk, and can handle snow. The perfect car This car is a blast to drive!  Great \\rinterior quality.  I purchased used (w/ \\r10,000 miles) and have not had any \\rreliability issues to date.  Very few \\rS4\\'s on the road, so it\\'s great driving \\ra unique car.  I have no complaints so \\rfar (except for the poor gas mileage), \\rand would HIGHLY recommend to anyone \\rinterested in a used B5 S4.     you just wouldnt understand i did my homework and checked \\reverything that came close to \\rcomparing. Nothing matches the feel of \\rdriving this car, its handling and \\rdesign make it the perfect combination \\rof luxury and power. if you havent \\rdriven one you couldnt possibly \\runderstand. nothing else compares Great Car This is my first Audi and I love it.   can they improve it? This is my 2nd Audi. I got one of the last S4s. I won\\'t give it up easily.\\rThere is not much I would change, it has the classis A4 shape and proportions. I pray for cool wet days to humiliate just about anything else on the road. Yet I can take it to a business meeting and impress anyone. As always paint is awesome and the fit and finish of the interior is great. \"Silken Rocket\" as dubbed by AUDI I bought this car based upon a \\rcomparison with the BMW 3 series.  The \\r3 series felt cheap on the inside as \\rcompared with the S4.  This car has it \\rall for the price.  The turbo responds \\rinstantly, when you punch the gas it\\'s \\rgone.  Passing other vehicles has \\rbecome a full time occupation. S4 Review I was looking to purchase a vehicle to \\rreplace my huge 2001 GMC Yukon XL with \\ra bit better milage and more \\rperformance.  I looked into the S4, the \\r330xi, the IS300, and the Subaru \\rImpreza WRX.  None of them compared to \\rthe S4.  The performance and smoothness \\rof the S4 blew all of them out of the \\rwater except the Impreza WRX, but the \\rbuild quality of the S4 made that \\rdifference quickly.  The dealer service \\rhas been excellent, though the oil \\rchanges are a but infrequent. Awesome Fun Car Great car to drive.  Handles very well, \\rquick acceleration, good braking.  All \\rin all a great car to drive. Rims and Tires I love everything about the car but the \\rRims and Tires. All Wheel Drive should \\rbe good up North. Not according to \\rAudi. \\r They tell me to expect no more than \\r7500 miles from these tires and I \\rshould change rims at least once a \\ryear. At $3000 a year that is not \\rcomfortable. Pirelli says if you can \\rafford the car you can afford the tires.\\r Check what you are willing to pay. I \\rhave gone through $6,000. The stock \\rtires are horrible in ice and snow. quality for the wiser consumer The command of the S4 is great.  It \\rtook some getting accustomed after \\rdriving an American and Japanese car \\rfor so long.  I wanted a luxury car \\rthat was different, a gamer and \\rsomething I can put 300,000 miles on \\rwithin ten years. The interior of the \\rcar can\\'t be challenged.  My BMW \\rfriends get more attention and a higher \\rcar note in the M3 but that is all they \\rget. Der Uber Audi S4 This car is the best value for a \\rGerman sports sedan when compared to a \\rBenz or BMW.  Nearly every thing is \\rstandard, very few options.  Even the \\r6 speed manual or 5 speed automatic is \\ra no charge option!  Std Quattro AWD \\ris still the king after 20+ years of \\rproving its self.  The Benz still does \\rnot have AWD as an option on a C \\rclass, BMW left the AWD market in the \\rlate 80\\'s to early 90\\'s due to poor \\rreliability in their 325 ix\\'s AWD \\rdesign. And the new BMW 330 xi sits a \\rlot higher up than a non AWD 330 \\rsedan.  BMW still has a way to go on \\rperfecting the AWD sedan! Best Audi ever Great car. Loves to run and handles like this is the one for 40k I would buy the s4, even for \\r60 I would still buy a s4 and keep the \\rrest. I mean, whats better?\\rm3, well it has little problem with \\rthe transmission and a big problem \\rwith 8k redline.\\rIf it bothers you that the s4 goes 5.5\\rthen a chip and exhaust will do.\\rand when you run race fuel, the s4 \\rgain more hp then other cars gain.\\r So, unless you just dont like the \\rlook, its a great car to own. ultimate car The best car on the road for value, \\rfunction, performance & style. S4 HEAVEN This car is definitly the transportaion  \"S\" is for superlative! The S4 was my first foray into the \\r\"rarified air\" of automobiles. Forty \\rlarge may be chump change to some, but \\rI took the investment with deathly \\rseriousness. That said, the finacial \\routlay was definitely worth it. The S4 \\ris by far and away the most enjoyable, \\rand complete, car I\\'ve ever driven. I \\rspent many months comparing it against \\rthe BMW 330, Infiniti G35, and hordes \\rof other, similarly priced rides. In \\rthe final analysis, while each of those \\rcars brings something very special to \\rthe show, the S4 seems to bring \\rEVERYTHING. It\\'s fast, safe, luxurious, \\rand--at least compared with Bimmer, \\rPorsche, and some of the other uber-\\rmarques--sanely priced. The Wife\\'s Car After renting an A4 on vacation and \\rbeing rather impressed, decided to look \\rinto an S4 when buying a new car. We \\rsuddenly became VERY impressed. The car \\ris more than capable for the average \\rdriver and offers great performance for \\rthose who desire it. You would spend \\rtwice the money for a Porsche that has \\rlike features. A Suburu WRX is cheaper \\rbut then again its a Subaru! Understated Performance This car is a sleeper.  It performs \\rexcellent under any road condition, \\rwhether it is dry, wet, or frozen.  \\rAcceleration and torque are outstanding \\reven in stock form.  Definately get a \\rbetter bang for your buck with an Audi \\rS4 vice a BMW 3 series.  When you add \\rcomparable options (cold weather, \\rsport, etc.) on the 3 series you a) pay \\rmore, and b) have a lower quality car.  \\rOne look at the interior and exterior \\rtrim quality of the S4 will make you \\rrealize this. A great ride and a great deal I\\'ve returned to German cars after a \\rbrief stint with American. The S4 is \\rjust a great ride; tight, fast, and \\rsecure. It holds the road in all \\rweather even with its standard \\rperformance tires. I looked at 3 series \\rBMWs and C series Mercedes before \\rbuying the S4. I had a BMW before but \\rfound both them and the Mercedes to be \\roverpriced for what you got. The S4 is \\ra great balance of performance and \\rvalue. A Nightmare I had my car for about a year and it \\rhas been it the shop for evertyhing \\rmore than once and even something three \\rtimes. The car has been in the shop \\rmore than 50 days altogether. For \\rthings like brakes , transmission, \\rabs , Electronic stability system , \\rreverse lights, tiptronic, auto dimming \\rmirrors. The best part is that Audi \\rtold me that even though my car is so \\rproblematic and none of the defects is \\rmy fault that this car defects do not \\rwarrant a new vehicle. I pray that this \\rsituation will never occur to anyone \\relse. If you are reading this think \\rabout what you are doing? (Purchasing \\ran Audi) Best 4 door under $50K Superlative engine - has loads of  Great Audi It goes very fast, feels very solid and \\rall the while is very smooth.  I \\rreceived an A4 loaner and rode it all \\rday..nice car but when I got my S4 back \\rI realized what the 8K upcharge \\rbuys..all of the above.  I will buy the \\rnext generation if they keep the \\rcomputerized suspension to a minimum \\rand hopefully they will put this CAR on \\ra diet. What a Delight!! This car is awesome to drive.  Worth \\rthe money to buy. Upgraded the ECU on \\rthis car, went up against a new 2002 \\rInfiniti Q45 with 340HP and I beat him, \\rnot by much but goes to show what an \\rAudi can do against a car with 300+ HP. \\rWould highly recommend anyone \\rinterested in one to go down to your \\rlocal dealer and test drive one today!!! Great Performance I own a 2001 S4 including all features with the exception of the navigation system.  This car handles great.  Hugs the road, terrific pick up and is fun to drive. A sleeper car to the uninitiated First off I don\\'t see how Edmund\\'s could rate this car\\'s engine performance as 7.0, fun to drive 7.0 and value rating 6.0. What car rates a 9 or better?  Ferrari or Porsche? This car was on Edmund\\'s 2000 editor\\'s sought after list and it nows rates a 7.4? \\r This car is a blast and a much better value dollar for dollar versus the higher praised BMW 3-series.  Do the comparison and you have to go with the Audi.\\r Given proper tires this car is an all-year round all-weather performer.  A tuner\\'s delight, with the simple change of an ECU chip you have a 300hp+ rocket. The S4 Rocks! This is a great car.  The Editor\\'s Rating(of 7.4) simply makes no sense. It looks good, is very fast, and extremely practical.  Can you take 4 people across the country? No, but you can take 4 out to dinner.  The interior is beautiful.  My only complaints are: headroom (I have a tall torso), and the (6sp)shifter is a little notchy. Most underrated car Most underrated, well rounded vehicle. Fast (5.5 sec 0-60; 14.1 sec quarter mile), handles like a snowmobile on snow, fun and safe all-weather machine; yet can be quiet and luxurious around town, full of amenities at a reasonable price. The S4 is also the easiest car in the market to upgrade significantly. For a mere $500-600, the turbos can be reprogrammed to a safe 1 bar configuration by chip to produce 370+ lbs/sq ft of torque that will leave M3\\'s in the dust, without compromising the engine. What a rush A great alternative to a true \"sports car\".  Great in bad weather, has 4 doors, fast, handles great without a harsh ride.  What\\'s not to like?  I would have to own 3 separate cars to do what this ONE can. best car car for the money this is the the most increditable car owned Love my S4 The car is great. The fun you can have in four door.  The 250hp engine really comes to life and you can feel it just go and go.  The quattro system is unbelieveable and the ESP is a nice addition. THe interior is very retro and new, not boring like every other car out there. \\rI love my Audi!!!!! perfect! great perfomance,nice styling. watered-down DTM car, mechanic sold separately Throaty as hell, insane torque and acceleration w/o turbos or supercharger, gorgeous inside/out especially with carbon fiber interior, Recaro seats, 6 spd manual a must, AWD rally car-inspired performance for the street, handles like a half track in the winter with a pair of Blizzaks or other decent all-season/winter tires.  Burns through gas/tires and you\\'ll never want to be too far away from your nearest German auto mechanic.  Aftermarket warranties are definitely your friend even if you have to fight the warranty company and your mechanic to use them when necessary.  Lots of enthusiasts out there so no shortage of how-to repair videos, mods/upgrades through JHM or APR and others, and articles online like Audizine.  Timing chain tensioners/guides are looming maintenance calamity cause they\\'re shitty plastic components buried between engine and firewall requiring engine pull for replacement, ouch.  Giant 4.2L crammed into an engine compartment designed for a 2.0L T meaning you have to be a lemming to reach anything without completely disassembling it to get at it.  Pretty much a watered-down DTM car, a true sports car driving experience.  You\\'ll love it but you\\'ll pay for it just like anything in life. 4Door AWD Rocket! Only have had the car for a few month, but I love it more with each day.  Silky smooth V8 with a brilliant 6 spd tranny.  Pull exceptionally in every gear.  Love the seats with the alecantra inserts.  The Bose stereo sounds great, however the ipod adapter broke shortly after I bought it.  Still a compromise This car is just a notch above the A4. No doubt it is a blast to drive (think smooth linear acceleration) and luxurious inside, it is still not a sports car by any stretch. It\\'s got a ton of gadgets, but 0-60 still takes forever. It looks great, but falls short of the styling of its BMW competitor. The best thing is the price. I bought mine for $44000 fully loaded. If you are a good negotiator, you should be able to do far better.  Beautiful S4 This car is everything you expect it to be and more. It\\'s comfortable and has all the buttons and switches and toys you could ever want. Everything makes sense, everything works the way it should, and you can tell Audi used very high quality components that most people would never notice. Like very quiet power window motors, totally silent rear window power sunshade. The sound of the engine is intoxicating.  It squirts like lighting between corners. Suspension doesn\\'t squat, dive or roll, but is perfectly luxurious like an Audi should be. Mine is electric blue and I get compliments almost daily on it. Think pure domination. 2008 Audi S4 - Chesterfield,VA Love this car! Rips up the road with ease and provides a smooth stable ride. Rear seats are a bit tight but I don\\'t ride back there  2008 Audi S4 I love the sound and performance of the big V8. The AWD has been impressive in the snow and on ice. It can still get stuck if the snow is deep enough, and the traction control system is complex. Audi does not provide good information on it. The ride is on the harsh side, and not adjustable. There have been transient squeaks and rattles from the interior body panels. The rear seat is cramped. Aside from all this, the car is very quick, handles well and is a blast to drive. Navigation and audio system both excellent, and I like the iPod integration even though the track names do not show up on the screen Great convertible The S4 convertible is a stylish car! I have driven mine for 2000 miles now and just love it. Compared to other convertibles in this high performance range you get much more car for your money. I looked at the M3, but found the Audi better for every day driving. Great and smooth 8 cyl engine Best Car I\\'ve Ever Owned The S4 Cabriolet is beautiful inside and out, performs like no other cruiser-sports car, and commands a price that is less than its competition by thousands.  There is no car I\\'d rather own- unless you\\'re talking about the RS4 Cabriolet (but I wouldn\\'t want such bad gas mileage right now)! Best car I\\'ve ever owned I have owned Caddy\\'s Lexus Lincolns BMW and Mercedes. This car, especially since it is a convertible, is the best car I have ever owned. Fast response. Tons of power. Great on highway and especially fun going through the mountains. I\\'m 6\\' 1\" and I can\\'t believe the spacious feeling even when the top is up. Fast, Rough and Thirsty One of the fastest cars I have ever owned (and I like fast expensive cars), a blast to drive for fun, but after a year I can\\'t live with it anymore.  A fifteen gallon tank and 15-18 miles to the gallon means filling up every other day. At 80 mph the car is turning 3200 rpm and while the suspension feels great on back roads, on the highway (where I spend too much time) the suspension makes small road imperfections feel like speed bumps. I know I won\\'t get much sympathy here, but when talking on the cell phone on the highway, road imperfections make my voice warble, not good when talking to clients. A GREAT weekend car, but a tough daily driver.     Audi S4 25th Quattro The Audi is flawless with exception to the throttle.  Quite abrupt and takes careful modulation to get the smoothest operation.  Best car I\\'ve owned to date.  Comfort is wonderful and conveniences are outstanding.  Performance is on par or better than most sport cars in the higher dollar range.  Engine performance and torque are nothing short of massive, without being peaky. Lug it in a lower gear and it accelerates away without hesitation. I can\\'t wait to drive the RS4.  Fit and trim is perfect.  Transmission is precise with positive shifting.  Front to rear bias is absolutely terrific with neutral steering.  Sound system is perfectly matched to the Audi without being harsh and overbearing.   2006 Audi S4 quattro 4dr Sedan This is a great all-around car with few compromises.  I traded a 2003 M3 for my S4. I love the S4s V8 rumble, MUCH better than the M3\\'s metallic howl at higher rpm.  The S4 is a technology showcase (w/ NAV.sys) vs the basic M3. The M3 wins by the numbers (0-60, slalom times, etc), but the Audi is easier to live with and more luxury. The AWD S4 pulls effortless out of a corner; the stability system remains invisible unless real trouble is at hand. Who needs a BMW? After test driving a new Corvette and a Boxster S, I drove the Audi S4.  I fell in love with the S4!  Great looks, the sweetest interior, and a cool sounding exhaust note.  The MMI system and the Sirius radio help keep my mind from driving this car as fast as it wants to go! The best I\\'ve owned The moment I test drove it I fell in love.  Have owned M3s and C55. Nothing corners like the S4.  Rigid body, great handling, powerplant sounds like Mozart wrote the notes. Passing ability, and comfort are all just perfect. No reason to have a porsche. Trunk is huge, will hold two golf bags in comfort.  I do not think I could have done better, and I test drove them all. Quality and finish are impeccable. Even the factory blue tooth, and navigation, as well as premium sound are superior. Good going Audi!  Awesome Last Minute Switch from 530XI I spent 6 months looking for an AWD Sport Sedan (live in NE, lots of snow and hills). Really didn\\'t love any of them.  Finally decided on BMW530XI over InfinitiM35X and LexusGS300.  Went to buy 530XI and saw this at the dealer. One drive and I was sold. The car has the excitement that all the others are lacking.  Acceleration, cornering, grip, etc... without the \"ego\" factor - understated \"stealth\".  And the interior is much more functional than the BMW. Electronics (NAV, SAT Radio) work flawlessly!  Recaro seats are perfect for a comfortable, but aggressive drive.   This car competes as a realistic option for more than just the M3 it is usually compared with.  I couldn\\'t be more pleased! Simply superb I had contemplated the purchase of an M3 for quite some time until I had the pleasure of taking this baby out for a spin.  How could I resist, this blows away the competition with power, luxury, performance, and not the least of all... gorgeous sound from that V8 engine.   understated coolness When I test drove this car for the first time, I was amazed at how fast I could go without realizing the actual speed. Now with 5000+ miles under me, I must say I love this car. It\\'s very forgiving around corners, no matter how fast, it just turns. I used the shifting paddles on the way home from the dealer, as I went into sixth I looked down and was doing 140 mph, effortlessly. I have since found that it will go the limiter of 155, but did that very briefly. I do find that I drive around 90 mph on the highways and pass at over a hundred, just step on the gas at 70 or so and your instantly at 100. Ride is very comfortable. And the sounds this engin makes is music. S4 is one of my favorites. Kicks! Much smoother, classier, funner to drive than the M3 by far! Real sports feeling. This car is so fun to drive!!! I\\'ve owned my \\'06 S4 for 3 months now and I never thought driving a car could be this fun. The AWD, V8, and 4 doors are mostly why I chose it over the BMW M3. The 40/60 torque differential is also a big plus, but note that the S4\\'s w/tiptronic do not have this feature. This car loves gasoline and I average about 17-18mpg overall, but if you can afford this car and you crave performance then gas mileage should not be an issue. The cornering is amazing and the AWD really keeps the car glued to the road. I\\'ve even driven on snow covered roads with performance tires and had no drama at all. This car does everything.  Impressive - Sure footed I am a frequent car buyer that is infatuated with performance and style. My previous cars include, 3-Series BMW\\'s, Sabb 9-3 Viggen, Lexus IS300 - all bought new. I seem to always a reason why I need a new car. So this time I spent a lot of attention to Audi S4, BMW M3, Lexus IS 350, and Infiniti G35 coupe. After considerable test drive, the German choices were obvious for their fun to drive feel and style. Considering the off track use of the car and actual fun to drive feeling for us non-professional mere mortals, the Audi S4 proved to be the best choice. It has been 3 months and has definitely proven to be the best choice from the dealership experience, to its outstanding driving pleasure. great car, not as good as the old one I have owned my \\'05 S4 of one year and 15000 miles.  I still don\\'t like it as much as my old \\'00 model with the bi- turbo.  If I had never driven that, I\\'d be in love with this.  This is a great car for sure, but the \\'00 was better.  Faster, tighter, more torque.  This car loves gas, and at $2.60 a gallon, loves alot of it.  The \\'00 was more economical too.  The heating and ac in this \\'05 can\\'t be adjusted right.  You either freeze of die from heat.  The dealer says it\\'s a new system-I like the old one better!  Oh well only 2 years more on my lease. Never Loved a Car Until the S4 Fantastic car!  I\\'ve had Porsches, BMW Ms, and this 05.5 S4 is really the first car I really love.  It\\'s a great balance of understatement with raw power and fun.  Fuel economy and lack of a few technical toys available on some 30k cars are my only complaints.  Car handles fantastically.  With winter tires, it\\'s unbelievable in the snow.  No complaints!  The exhaust note is just PERFECT.   Simply the finest car on the road I don\\'t care what anybody says, Audi has blown away MBZ and BMW in the worst way with this car.  There is nothing this car cannot do... I can go in the snow without chains, but smoke Mustang Cobras all day long at the same time.  Mileage is poor, but if you are worried about MPG, you have no business owning a car of this caliber.  This is my 3rd Audi, and definately not my last.  I have owned MBZ\\'s, Lexus, and had much experience with Beemers, but this car embarrasses them. Most practical in its class Similiar to the M3 and CTS-V except it offers all wheel drive, which is huge in areas where you get poor road conditions.  Highly recommended. Luxury Speedster Awesome car! Performance, styling and comfort make this car so much better then the previous S4. rocketship I have owned a lot of vehicle and would have to say that my s4 is by far the best I have ever owned. the accerlation is mind boggling. The car handles at high speed better than my old m3. The sound of the motor is music to anyones ears. especially over 5k on the tach.  Actually a 2006 Cabriolet I have just received my 2006 S4 Cabriolet (Silver with red leather seats) and so far it is great. The driving has been smooth with a slight edge and I can honestly say I have never had so much fun behind the wheel of a car. It has the bluetooth prep which works well but does not transfer the phone book or control the phone directly this is in my view a bug and needs to be corrected. If phone book transfer directly from the phone is tough why not at least allow phone book transfer from the SD card? The sound system is stellar even my wife (who is notoriously picky and sensitive to volume) tells me to crank it up Dr. Jeckill & Mr. Hyde This car can be a street racer or a daily commuter and does both well.  This was my first Audi with an automatic (7 speed duel clutch) transmission.  I do not miss the manual and cannot think of buying another car without the duel clutch transmission.  I was sorry to see that the 2018 S4 is back to an 8 speed automatic because of the torque spikes of the new turbocharged 3.0 V6.  I have a 2018 Audi Q5 on order.  It has the duel clutch transmission. A great sport sedan. I continue to be amazed with this car. It\\'s been driven on track by a pro race driver who was wowed with its ability to hold the road - among other things. I love the acceleration both from a stop and when needed to get by something quickly. With the back seats down there is an amazing amount of space. I\\'ve had 8\\' landscaping timbers plus hundreds of pounds of soil and fertilizer in the car with the trunk closed! Only caution would be that it\\'s not for four adults. Not much space or comfort in the back seat. Everything you want in a 6M sport sedan If you are looking for well engineered sport sedan, super fun to drive, classy not flashy, comfortable, and, most importantly for me,  with a 6M, this is your car.   Let me just get the transmission issue out of the way right now.  I don\\'t know why people would get an automatic in a car like the S4.  You\\'re buying a Camry, Impala, or whatever, sure, go with an automatic, who cares, but an Audi with V6 supercharged engine?  The whole point of a car like the S4 is to have some fun, but then you get an automatic with it and you\\'re saying, \"actually, I want to reduce the fun I have with this car.\"  What?  Anyway, whatever, just my bias.         Okay, to the car itself -- what a marvelous vehicle.   I did a lot of research on cars in this range, test drove a few, and knew this was the one I wanted.  It took me nearly a year to find a used one in the right color (grey), black optic package (just for the wheels, don\\'t care about extras), with the 6M, and the right price, but when I found it online, I jumped and bought it used with 12K miles and hope to keep it a long time.          Engine and transmission: fantastic, best transmission I\\'ve ever driven, engine sounds great, power is there all day long at whatever speed you want.    Spectacular.    Some people (mainly auto critics) complain about not enough \"feedback\" from the steering.  I don\\'t know any better and the steering feels great to me.    This car sticks to the road.  I put Conti ExtremeContact DWS on a few months ago.  They are not quite as sticky as the summer tires that were on, but the very marginal loss of performance in turns is more than offset by the superb all weather capability.  With the Contis and quattro, I am ready for any ice and snow or rain.    Interior and exterior are beautiful, not flashy, very sophisticated.  That\\'s what I wanted.  If you want to show off, get some attention, you may need to look at another car.    Tech:  these are my only nits.  As noted in reviews, the MMI control knob spins in a non-intuitive direction.  Why?  I have no idea.  The MMI interface is good, not great, but good.  Love the dash display, all the options.  Climate control is my least favorite feature.  It works, but it is too complicated, too many buttons.  I am still not 100% positive what I am ending up with when I make certain adjustments.  I can live with it.    The S4 comes with so many other helpful electronic features that I highly recommend you go through the manual page by page to make sure you are aware of them all.  (For example, you can set the passenger side mirror to tilt down when you back up.  Never would have known that.)   You can adjust suspension, engine sound, etc.   In sum, this is a wonderful car.  There are other possibilities in this price/performance range, but I can\\'t imagine anyone ever regretting the S4.  (especially with the 6M transmission!) One of my best purchases Was on the fence between the S4 and the 335i, and boy am I glad I got the Audi. I\\'ve had the car for 2 years, and this is a short summary of what I\\'ve learned. I\\'ll go straight to the point and point out the bad first.Transmission: can get clunky; when you pop it into Drive, its response is laggyHandling: my previous Genesis coupe felt more confident-inspiring in the cornersMMI: I prefer the MB Command or the Porsche interfaceThat\\'s pretty much all the cons that I can think of. The car accelerates as well as any 3.0L S\\'charged sport sedan will go. Brakes are fantastic with a consistent feel. The seats are not plush, but won\\'t give you any issues. Drove from FL to NY and did not feel too bad. Build quality is top notch. My brother has the F30 328xi and the Audi feels more sturdy. Read before you buy I bought this car new last year, for the first year I loved the car, every aspect of it with small somewhat irritating problems. Wind blowing throw the windows on the highway right off the lot will drive you insane if you are listening to talk radio. \\rMy S4 came with the Upgraded Summer Tire package with the Continental Conti Contact 3s. These are the Worst tires in the world, the tread pattern wore out \"unusually\" after 7K miles, seriously...That is a like 2k option, what a waste, if you car has these tires make them change them before you buy.  A German muscle car, sleeper division This car represents a Teutonic variation on the classic American muscle car: take a mid-size car (the A4, in this case) and install a larger, more powerful engine. There is more to the S4 than that, of course, but that is the essence of it. The only way of distinguishing it from an A4, at a glance, is the presence of small S4 badges front and rear, and the V6T badges on the front fenders.\\rThe S4 gives excellent acceleration with superb handling and ride quality, combined with reasonable fuel economy. It is not inexpensive (especially in Prestige trim), but I cannot think of a car with its combination of virtues available at a lower price from any other manufacturer. GREAT BMW ALTERNATIVE, FAIR PRICING I do not like how soft BMW cars have become - like American muscle cars of the past with lots of power but they just cannot handle (turn) well. I sold a 2013 128i M Sport after just 9 months. I drove the 2015 M235i and M3 sedans all day long at the BMW Car Control event. I am very unimpressed with the new M3. Poor seating position, turbo lag is prevalent, and it actually has too much torque to be fun. I have had VW and Audi in the past and they all were unreliable. Decided to look at the S4 on a whim - did not really even cross my mind, but maybe that\\'s a good thing. It looks like a \"regular\" A4. The 6-speed manual shift action is smooth and the clutch actually has feel - BMW is too soft. Brake failure I bought the S4 because it is advertised as a track car by Audi at their Sports Car Experience at Infineon Raceway. After a warm up session, then 15 minutes on the track I had fade and then failure from my brakes. At the dealership the rotors were determined to be bad. I have owned so many cars, 10 Audi\\'s, and NEVER has this happened. According to the dealership Audi USA will not cover the brakes they put in my car. How is it the S4\\'s they have you track at their raceway last but mine cannot? This car is not for tracking since the manufacturer does not back up it\\'s product and treats loyal owners poorly. Truth in engineering= failure to support customers. Excellent Driver\\'s Car I am now on my third Audi and my current S4 is certainly the best. I test drove all models excluding A8 (can\\'t afford it anyway) and S4 drives the best. Especially in its Sport mode - what a thrill! You can make it a normal commute car and join thousands of other generics on the highway during rush hours. But you can put in more aggressive mode and enjoy a proper sports car at a press of a button (well several buttons anyway). Brilliant design, excellent engineering and great execution. ----- My first review (see above) was written 3+ years ago. Well now I owned this car for 3.5 years. It is an excellent driver\\'s car indeed. Engine is simply superb,  smart technology and very thoughtful quality accents are everywhere, car software is perfect. It still drives like a dream. I am very happy with my purchase. Love the quality and reliability, love the intelligence and absolutely love the speed and acceleration. No breakdowns whatsoever in 3.5 years and 56K miles.However maintenance cost is way too high if you don\\'t do it yourself. I decided to do as much as possible myself (I like working on my cars) and after some initial investment in required tools my son and I already changed oil, breaks, disks, sparks plugs, filters, etc - everything strictly according to the maintenance schedule and AUDI torque specs. We use only OEM parts and save about 60-70% compared to our local dealership price. We also had to buy a special cable to re-program the car, reset service reminder, etc. I actually love working on this AUDI, it is very well engineered and it is a pleasure to service it.There is one more thing to know / consider. You should not expect this car to be very economical fuel consumption-wise. It all depends how you drive it - you can get anywhere from 15 to 28 MPG on a highway. Once you floor it, your MPG drops - but the thrill is very well worth it.Highly recommended to those who like quality, sophistication, reliability, technology and speed. This S4 delivers all of that. Good job AUDI! 2014 S4 *Great Car*  I have owned my 2014 Audi S4 for about 6 months now.Overall its a great car for daily driving, but has the ability to turn to super car on demand when you want a fun ride home!I am getting 25MPG for blended driving.Even with summer tires its gets around great on icy and snow covered roads.Fit and finish are top notch. Early impressions on 2014 S4 6MT highest trim Sheer power, handling, and fun to drive factors are its highlights.Drive Select is now standard across all trims and changes the car from comfortable daily driver to aggressive sports car. Great car, except for the lemon thermostat. Beware: The thermostat in the 2011 Audi S4 is a very well documented faulty part. Google it. Audi finally agreed to cover 10% of the $1200 repair as I was slightly over the 50K mile warranty.  If you\\'re okay with that, buy one. It\\'s a great looking fun car. S-4 2011 S-4Quartz Grey/Black Interior6sp ManualPrestige PackageSports DifferentialHere is my 12 month review.Purchased the car in October 2010, have so far put 10,0000 trouble free miles on it.The car has lived up to my expectations both for performance and comfort.The shear speed of it is impressive, yet when I am just concerned with having a peaceful drive home the car delivers.Very happy to be in this car. 2011 Audi S4 Premium Plus with S Tiptronic I just purchased this car as a CPO with 7700 miles on it.It is Meteor Gray with black/red interior.Options include the Nappa leather package, Bang & Olufsen stereo, Pirelli P-Zero\\'s, and iPod connection.The performance of the vehicle is incredible at every level.I sold a \\'04 BMW M3 and \\'02 Porsche 911 because I needed an AWD vehicle.The S4 performs equally or better than both of those vehicles.Power is instantaneous and shifting is smooth and controlled.Interior design is well laid out with easy access to controls.The MMI system takes a little getting used to but overall it functions well once it is learned. Awesome Audi S4 This Audi S4 is now my 10th car, and it exceeds all my expectations.Over the years, I\\'ve had a BMW 325, 328, 335, and a Lexus IS 350.The Audi S4 exterior is beautiful, the interioris gorgeous, and the drive is outstanding.I love having a manual transmission, and the Audi Drive Select takes driving to a different level.Even the base stereo system is pretty good. I\\'m not an audiophile, so I was concerned about not getting the B&O system; but I have no regrets.It\\'s loud, it\\'s crisp, there\\'s an amplifier, a subwoofer, tweeters, speakers, and it gets the job done. New 2011 prestige S4 with sport differential I have had my Audi S4 for 8 days now. Put 520 miles on it city/hwy driving. It replaces my 2001 BMW 330i.The handling and driving experience is uncomparable.It far surpasses my wildest expectations. It handles curving country roads amazingly. I must admit there is a curve on the way to work rated at 35mph that I took at 75mph this morning without even breaking a sweat (there was good visibility with no cars or creatures in sight).I highly recommend this car.Voice recognition system and MMI beats BMWs in my opinion.Driving in \"dynamic\" sport mode makes car very tight and responsive while \"comfort\" mode is good for wife and family drives! Best purchase ever! I LOVE this car.I have never bought anything that I have been so happy with!I was hesitant to spend this much on a car but I can honestly and wholeheartedly say this car is WELL WORTH THE MONEY!The power, acceleration and handling are fantastic. While its not as raw muscle as an M3 its definitely a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing.I love how many people try to race me or take me off the line and cannot touch this thing.It is an absolute blast to drive.Its almost depressing when you hit 80-85 and realize what the consequences would be to get caught going any faster.The interior is superb, its is uber comfortable and everything works very well with very few exceptions. An Enthusiasts Daily Driver  Driving my new S4 four weeks now and am enjoying the car immensely.Easy and very fun to drive both in town and on the hwy. Put on 2100 miles - 900 in town and 1200 on a long road trip.Fit and finish is top notch.Blend of performance, luxury/comfort along with its mid-size makes this car almost perfect as a daily driver.Doesn\\'t quite have the surgical handling and steering feel of a BMW 3 series.But the S4\\'s power, smooth/responsive drive train, top notch build quality and materials, and extra six inches in length over the 3 series more than makes up for this. The S4 is a fast, stylish, higher end performance vehicle that is well worth its higher price. Audi S4 Rocks My first Audi was a red 2008 TT with a 3.2L MT6 and totally ruled the road.This is my second Audi and is black and looks classy with a capital \"C\".The exterior rules with its accented body panels and is topped off with the \"Supercharged\" badging.The interior is sporty and the MMI is pretty cool with it\\'s Sirius, Navigation and back up camera.If you test drive this baby, be prepared to bring her home! My New Addiction Where to start?... This is my first Audi and new car. After about a year of research trying to find a car that had everthing I needed and wanted I finally found the S4. I live in Iowa right now so I wanted something that would handle these un-Godly winters and the AWD does that with ease. But this car is so much more that just sure footed. The interior is beautiful, it has power to spare and it\\'s exterior reminds me of a sexy nerd; she kind of just blends in until you take the time to notice her. I was considering Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar and Range/Land Rover but my Audi was the best fit for me and I have absolutely no regrets. I\\'m looking forward to buying my next Audi. Near Perfectoin I have owned an E92 335 and an E90 M3,  and can say this is the best car I have ever owned.  The combination of performance, comfort and price point is ideal when compared to competitors.  The performance isn\\'t quite in M3 territory, but the increased torque in this car, particularly on the low-end, make this car more fun and usable as a daily driver (not to mention it\\'s about $15k cheaper than the M3).  The S4 is also faster than the 335 and has a superior interior and stereo.  The B&O system is impressive.  Overall the car is amazing, only small nits that I can complain about...no memory seats, transmission is a bit lazy in auto mode   4 door sports car I purchased my S4 three weeks ago. This car is a prestige model that has most of the factory options including the sports rear differential, and adaptive cruise. The basics such as Nav, bluetooth, etc.. are all part of the prestige package. I was concerned about losing the V8 with its great sound, but the supercharged V6 gives up nothing performance wise. The car is fast, nimble, and still gives you a quality high end feel. In addition, the adaptive cruise control is awesome. It\\'s an expensive option, but at the end of the day when you\\'re done racing around, you can kick back and let the car almost drive itself. This car is a sports car that won\\'t beat you up when driven on a daily basis Fun car to drive! I test drove BMW 3 and 5 series, Infiniti M37 and Mercedes E Class.  This car beats them all hands down in terms of pure driving enjoyment.  I cannot wait to drive this car everyday, its that good.  The acceleration from 0 - 60 will blow you away.  It has a lot of power, yet is very smooth and handles extremely well.  Its a head turner, I\\'ve only had it for a month and had many compliments.  The inside is very nicely designed, sound system is incredible and Nav is easy to use.  The only thing they forgot on this car was the seat memory!!  Drives me nuts.  I know you can get seat memory as an option, I just overlooked it.  Check this one out, one test drive and you will feel like James Bond. Incredible machine S4 Just got the 2011 Audi S4 for wife. Target price for this fully loaded car was $61+k. Only option left out was automatic rear and manual sun shades. Better to get tint at dealer. Have Mercedes E class that were great cars. While they were nice to drive the S4 is fun to drive. Stability and handling is superb and acceleration will set your hair on fire. Had Porches in the past and the S4 is just like driving a Porsche only with 4 doors. Feels like you are in a fancy go cart with a jet engine and a smooth ride but still feel connected to the road.   Audi Q7 PRESTIGE S-LINE This vehicle has one of the best factory stereo systems I have ever heard.  The original owner paid for the $6300.00 optional Bang & Olsen 14 speaker, 1000 watt digital amp system.  The front dash speakers both raise up out of the dash for proper staging and clarity.  All of the speakers have aluminum grilles and sound amazing no matter what type of music you prefer.  The vehicle has the 295/35/21 in tires mounted on 21×10in wheels that give the vehicleft an aggressive stance and look.  I love the vehicle but my wife wants something smaller.  We are considering the 2016 BMW M4 M edition and the Audi SQ5 S-Line.  I wish this vehicle was mine but I bought it for my wife and she wants to trade it towards something smaller. Amazing It is beautiful, fast (I\\'m gonna get a ticket... I can just tell), quiet- the only thing I can hear is the 1,000 watt B and O system that puts music into your soul, advanced technology- that will take me years to figure out... have I mentioned it is a head turning German engineered machine?  New to 35K review Phenominal vehicle.The engine delights me still. Lots of torque, feels sporty despite its size.7000 lb towing capacity, seats 7 and will get 32 mpg on the highway. There\\'s a 400 mile stretch of desert through AZ and NM where I\\'ve done this twice!Gets almost as good mileage, in town, as my A8 gets on the highway. love the wifi hotspot, thought it was a silly gimmick, but my wife uses it with the iPad often. Wifi is tmobile so coverage isn\\'t great but it\\'s great for looking at restaurant reviews and researching hotels etc. Love the google driven Nav.The satellite overview makes exploring easier and adds visual interest.Makes driving at night and in the rain more engaging. Really impressed....Love my Q7 I thought I\\'d wait until I hit around 1 year before I left a review.It\\'s been about 1 year since I bought my Q7 TDI and I thought I\\'d share my thoughts on it.I\\'ve been very happy with the Q7.Originally I wasn\\'t planning on going with the TDI but the dealership happened to have one in stock on their showroom floor and it had all the features that I wanted.It would have taken about 2 months to custom order one so I decided to go with the TDI even though it was more expensive. Right choice for 3rd row SUV I\\'ve been a reliability & total cost of ownership shopper for the last 20 years gravitating toward Japanese semi-luxury brands (i.e. Lexus, Infiniti, Acura) because I believed I would get a more reliable vehicle with more included features at a lower price. After 3 different experiences where issues started to crop up at 110k miles, I decided to deviate from that belief and take a bet on the Audi Q7 as my first foray into German luxury. So far, I\\'m really happy I did. I referred to the Japanese equivalents as semi-luxury because there is a noticeable difference. The fit and finish of the Audi is much nicer than our MDX. The Audi was slightly more expensive and came with less safety features/technology but the driving experience and feel outweighs the additional check boxes of features that I rarely use anyway. Luxury SUV with great technology Have been very happy with the car. Very quiet ride, compared to previous MDX. Google maps doesn’t have street view, but very nice to have in cockpit. It would be nice it center display could have split screen, a lot of wasted space when viewing radio. New change of car I have been driving the BMW 750LI, for many years, and had a Range Rover in between them.  The Audi Q7 is a beautiful, well appointed, technology savvy ( smarter than the operator at time) and handles like a dream.  The vehicle I used to drive was an incredible heavy, effortless drive and other than the weight of the vehicle, the drive is amazing.  It’s a little different  just getting used to sitting a little higher up, but I am thrilled beyond on words at my new 2108 Q7 and would highly recommend this vehicle to all my family and friends!!!! New 2018 Audi Q7 breaks in 100 miles !!!!! I leased a new 2018 Audi Q7 from Audi Manhattan and it broke down on the first trip within a 100 miles. We were told that the computer hard drive had a problem. We asked for a replacement of the vehicle and we were passed onto Audi Corporate who promised a response in a week. I called today after a week and was passed onto Audi leasing. I am still waiting on a resolution. !!!! New 2018 AUDI Q7 Computer breaks down in 100 miles I leased a new Audi 2018 Q7 from Audi Manhattan and the computer conked off after the first 100 miles drive. We were told that there was a hardware problem. I asked for a replacement of the vehicle and they passed me on to Audi corporate. Audi Corporate said that they would resolve and call me back in a week. I had to call them today and they now passed me onto Audi Leasing company. I am still waiting for a resolution from them. 2.0T The Q7 is great.  Comfortable, spacious, and fairly easy to use technology. Our only complaint is that the 2.0 feels a bit under powered in hilly areas.  You can \"punch it\" and it\\'s fine, but starting from a stop going up hill it\\'s definitely not as quick as we\\'d like.  Overall it\\'s still a great care and a good value for what you get. Air ride and all wheel steering... Unbelievable! As a 2013 A8L 4.0 owner and 2015 Q7 TDI... I didn’t expect to change to our 2018 Q7 3.0 Prestige, Bang & O, Black out Optics package, Night vision, run flat all season tires.  Cold weather.   We live in Idaho and drive weekly up a 90 mile canyon.  Long grades and many tight turns.   NOTHING COMPARES to how well this 2018 performed!  I changed from comfort to dynamic and although there was a noticeable difference in hugging the turns, comfort handled amazingly well!   We ended up running comfort the rest of the trip.   Unbelievably quiet. Far more than my 2015 Q7.    My last comment to my wife-  “You are driving an A8 SUV!” NO SPARE TIRE -- NO SALE I test drove 2 loaded Q7\\'so and was really thrilled about the car and willing to fork over 72K until I found out about it having only run-flat tires and no possibility of a spare of any sort.  And the Q7 specific tire is apparently unique to the Q7, so getting a replacement in rural areas would involve spending a day or three in Bates Motel accommodations waiting for the new tire. Also, since the tires are more performance rather than high mileage rated, you\\'ll likely buy a pair if the tires are over 15k miles. And the tires are pricey too at $300 to 400. So $800 for 2 tires, at least one overnight stay somewhere you didn\\'t want,  and Bubba doing the work.  Since I do like driving cross country,  no thanks. drives like a dream be prepared to study the manual. Glitchy and unsafe 1. A small rock apparently had come through and damaged my auxiliary radiator which is not covered under warranty. In retrospect I discovered that the lower bumper air vent is without any protection and Audi had similar problem with other models. 2. The infotainment system is hard to use. Moreover to benefit from some advertised options you have to buy ATT data connection even when you have your own Verizon phone with unlimited data. 3. There is no tint on the windshield from the top and if you are under 6 feet it could be a problem with the orientation of the windshield. 4. The panoramic sunroof is covered by a flimsy cloth which is inadequate and hot under the sun. 5. Lane recognition is very unreliable. 6. The sound system even in my prestige leaves much to be desired. 7. It doesn’t have a simple break hold that Honda’s have nowadays. 8. Good luck and happy dancing while trying to open the trunk by inserting your foot under the bumper. 9. Electric issues with cameras suddenly deciding to turn off while backing. Great to drive Expensive car but drives beautifully and the technology is super So close! This Audi 2018 Q7 SUV drives really well, much more of a driver’s car than the 17 Lexus RX350h I drive.Very quiet and the tech is really well done. I had one for a half day test drive. Front area storage is very limited. Tiny cup holders and very shallow bins.  Like a lot of new cars, they use that high gloss piano black trim which shows smudges like crazy. This was the prestige trim. The ride was very good, solid as a vault, I imagine the air suspension would be awesome. Ultimately, however, the quoted lease price was about 50 % higher than a comparable 18 Lexus GX. The GX is waaay behind the Audi in tech and style but my wife feels safer being up high in the Lexus. Both stickered at about 72k and I find it hard to justify 1300 a month vs 800 for 36 months with nothing down. euphoria Takes some getting used to after using a big comfortable SUV with minimal gadgets.  Computerization is fascinating. I cannot wait to get back on the road! Rise of the Machines! The premium plus version of this car is packed with technology. However, Audi has taken the technology to another level. It is clear that autonomous driving technology is making it\\'s way in to today\\'s models. There are many features that are prefixed with \"assist\", \"adaptive\", \"pre-sense\". They are not just marketing buzzwords but rather features that try and influence the way you drive with the goal of safety and fuel economy in mind. If you do not like this idea then this is not the car for you. Some features cannot be permanently turned off such as auto start/stop which cuts the engine under certain conditions (like at a red light) to save fuel. It is very disconcerting at first especially if you are waiting to make a turn but the engine does start in the time between you lift your foot off the brake and step on the gas. It can be temporarily disabled by pushing a button but it is re-enabled after the car is turned off and on again. You need to use OBD II to permanently circumvent this behavior but may void your warranty. In terms of comfort, riding in this car is like flying business class on a 787. It\\'s pure luxury! Great SUV & wonderful dealership experience My wife and I leased a Audi Q7 premium plus back in 2007 and then moved to MB GL450 for our last 2 leases as the design and features grew stale on the Q. Happy to report that we are back with Audi and very pleased with our new 2018 Q7 Prestige (fully loaded) as its comfort, interior design and technology are its greatest assets. However, I wish Audi would have taken more chances with the design as it is not as aggressive as some competitors as well as increased cargo space to include room for a spare tire and larger coffee cups. That being said, we are really enjoying the vehicle and I have to mention our experience with the new Hawthorne Audi dealership in NY was wonderful and my Audi Brand Specialist (salesman) Devin Wooten was just terrific to work with. (NF) never deal with Audi Last October, my husband bought me a brand-new 2018 Q7 car, as a gift, from Audi Silver Spring, Maryland.  Surprisingly, in less than a month, a sudden annoying beep, repeatedly announcing an Emergency Call Malfunction, terrified us.\\xa0 After contacting Audi Service, they took the car on November 24th,\\xa02017, and promised to fix it in a day or two, saying they know about 2018 Q7 car defect.  This comment rang a bell in our mind.  If they already know about it, why Audi sell it without fixing it?!  Is this a fair trade?!  After more than 20 days later, Audi did not fix the car.\\xa0 Going back and forth, finally Audi’s Service Department told us that they could not fix the car, because\\xa0a part was not received from Germany!  This was not just an irrational excuse; but, also, a gross insult to us for spending over\\xa0sixty-seven thousand dollars on an Audi car, and receive such poor service!  Is this a fair trade?!  Anyhow, to solve this problem amicably, I told Audi’s Manager either to give us a full refund, or a new similar car.\\xa0 The latter agreed to provide us a new similar car in a few days.  Alas, Audi did not fulfill its promise, again. \\xa0For the benefit of doubt, we gave Audi’s Manager a longer delay; saying we are travelling and will be back around\\xa0mid- January.\\xa0 By then, we expect you to\\xa0give us a similar car, or a\\xa0full refund.\\xa0 Sadly, Audi did not fulfill its promise, for the third time.  By definition, a brand-new car means a defect-free car.  Hiding the 2018 Q7 car defect is an act of misleading and dishonesty.\\xa0\\xa0This defect is known by Audi and its dealership since some time.  Yet, Audi\\xa0did not tell us about it.  Thus, Audi\\xa0deceived us in selling this car.\\xa0 Plus, our 2018 Q7 car is considered a lemon car by Federal and State Law.Audi’s\\xa0Dealership knows that I am a science major and must concentrate on my studies.\\xa0 Audi wasted our time\\xa0for three months for no legitimate reason; during which we were – and still are – paying installments, interest, and insurance on a car, which we are not using since last November; because it is in Audi’s possession.\\xa0 Audi’s dealership has frustrated us, disappointed us, caused us to suffer, and denied us the enjoyment of using our own brand-new car.  By any standard, Audi’s transaction is –\\xa0unethical\\xa0and\\xa0unfair.\\xa0 Audi’s Director of Variable Operations offered us his apology for causing us this ordeal.\\xa0 Does he really think that his\\xa0apology shall alleviate our suffering?!  Based upon the aforesaid trouble, we find it very difficult for us to trust Audi anymore!\\xa0\\xa0We honestly believe that if Audi and its dealership\\xa0care about their name, business and reputation, they must cancel\\xa0this deal\\xa0as well as its\\xa0loan, immediately;\\xa0pay us a full refund\\xa0of our money, including all interest, insurance, and installments we made. Q7 review Really nice car.  Amazing ride.  A bit pricey. No spare tire??? I was going to place an order for a fully equipped Prestige Q7 but the night before, while going over the list of features, I discovered the Q7 is not equipped with a spare tire nor is there space to carry one . The next morning I called the tire dealer I generally use, Les Schwab Tires, and was told the 20” tires I was going to have the Q7 equipped would be a special order.  The can of fix a flat and compressor, that is included in lieu of a spare, is only good for 1/4”, or smaller, puncture in the tread of the tire. The fix a flat goop is of no use on a side wall cut which is not an uncommon occurrence on an SUV especially one as capable off road as the Q7.  The run flat tires have a recommended driving range of 50 miles. As I frequently travel in Central Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming, often outside of phone coverage, anyone familiar with these areas is aware that 50 miles is an inconsequential distance in many parts of the West. However if I were to be fortunate enough to be within miles of say Beatty Nevada what are the chances of finding a tire there that I could not find in Denver? The Q7 I was about to order was 93K which is too much to spend for a vehicle that could leave me stranded for something as simple as a flat tire. I love this SUV First, the negatives: There are a few things that are a little irritating. I sometimes bump my knee against the dash when getting in. The seat can be adjusted, of course, but when you are in hurry (like when it\\'s raining), I suspect you\\'d bump your knee. The dash and headlight controls could be pushed a little further in. Also, I sometimes hear some low level vibration in the rear door panels. I think it is more noticeable when my daughter puts her water bottle in the door pocket, but sturdier materials would probably help with the noise. Also the dash panel switches are brushed plastic type things. BMW uses more glossy materials which just look better. But the thing handles like a boss. The acceleration is pretty impressive, even for the 2.0 T. I switch between the Dynamic and Sport mode mostly and performance level change is incredible. Only had this for a month, so reliability questions are not applicable. The seats are spacious and comfortable. The 3rd row can seat average sized adults if needed. The trunk has plenty of space. The panorama roof if beautiful. The cabin lights, exterior lights, and assist lights are thoughtfully designed and soberly placed (not a glaring bright wash of harsh lights when you open the door). The cameras and console display are great. The LCD display on the dash is very useful and adjustable. And the handling! Yes, the handling! All in all, a winner. I\\'d buy it again! Love it & Hate it at same time! 2018 Q7 3.0T Premium Plus Quatro.  The car is luxurious, holds the road great, and even has a nice smooth ride, SOMETIMES.  If your freeways are often like the freeways in Los Angeles, be prepared to bounce like you\\'re in a U-HAUL, and it\\'s miserable!  It\\'s amazing that such an expensive, high-end SUV, has such a disparity with the drive.  At times, it\\'s so smooth and comfortable, and other times, it\\'s bouncy and horrible.  The head Audi technician brought me a new, identical car to the one we leased, to test drive exactly where I frequent, and it was the same!  Even he was baffled and disappointed as to the \"bounciness\" of the drive.  Just a side note, it\\'s difficult to get into the car without your knee smashing into the dashboard if you\\'re short.  I am 5\\' 1\" and it took me a few bruises on the knee until I got used to carefully & slowly getting into the car as to not bash myself on the lower portion of the dashboard. The cup holders are quite small and you\\'ll need to purchase coffee mugs with a narrow bottom diameter. Comfortable and Safe I love my Audi Q7. It has everything I want in an SUV. There are so many bells and whistles. It gets very good gas mileage for its size. The most important feature for me is that  visibility is great. No blind spots. It holds the road. I love the Head’s Up Display.  I feel very secure and safe in this car. And it has tremendous storage for  carrying whatever you need when the back two rows of seats are folded down.  I love the back massage feature on the heated seat. Great car Nicest car I’ve ever owned. Very quiet and luxury to drive Great Suv Very quiet. Requires a learning curve to utilize technology. Buy maintenance contract. Love it so much we ordered another one!! We ordered our 2017 Audi Q7 January 2016 and received it in April of 2016.  We took it on an 8000 mile trip.  The massaging, heated and cooled seats were amazing.  I dont travel well due to physical issues.  We added every option and package except rear side air bags and set up for rear seat entertainment.  We love ours so much we ordered a new one.  Fully loaded this time.  We did Prestige Package.  We have been very happy with the gas mileage.  On our trip we had the car loaded as we spent 6 weeks on the road,  we averaged 26 mpg.  To me for a full size SUV it was great.  I cannot find words to express how happy we are with our car. Papa Lou Great Auto Great size and handling, poor acceleration I liked everything about this car except the performance. It needs an SQ7 variant to suit my needs. I was thinking of trading \"up\" from my \\'14 S7 to the Q7 only it isn\\'t UP, it falls on its face. It needs more torque/HP to move the car along nicely. 333hp just isn\\'t enough to keep this car from feeling sluggish, 400hp would be about right. 2018 Audi premium plus 3ot Basically a sound well made car. Needs more storage capacity for tools road gear etc. Start stop system should be optional. Could cause an accident. Good looking car. Comfortable second row seating. Good mileage for the hp. vasco dealers will post a high price ,need to negotiate down a big percentage and checking nation wide the pricing of different dealers Overrated Audi Quality and Customer Satisfaction I recently purchase 2018 Audi Q7 (Sep 2017).  I confirmed the purchase trusting the dealership to do the right thing.  The car I purchased was just unloaded  off from delivery the day that I inquired. The unit was still wrapped.  I was assured that the new Q7 will be inspected and will be thoroughly cleaned. . . However, the car was delivered with serious paint defect - heavy pitting on rear quarter panel and tail gate (It looked like chemical that ate the paint.  Deep pitted surfaces).  And, driver side doors are not aligned.  I requested Keyes Audi to replace it with non-defective one or cancel the sale.  The arrogant GM said \"Sorry, it\\'s not going to happen\".  Long story short I was forced to bring in the car (never used).   It took 2 weeks for the brand new 2018 Audi Q7 in the dealership.  Later I found out that it was sent to a auto body shop 3 miles away.   I was able to get in touch with the manager of the body shop.  Job order:  remove paint from tail gate and rear quarter panel, feather fill and repaint.  It looked OK - but it is not factory process. . . Door alignment never got fixed.  Gen Manager of Keyes Audi said that there is no more adjustment possible.  Front and Rear door off by 3mm.  That\\'s the Audi quality?  And the defect is not even repairable.  Audi of America is not even doing anything to make up for the defects.  All they do is check the dealership on what they have to say.  And they talk like parrots, kept saying \"Audi will continue work within the terms of any applicable manufacturer\\'s warranty\" when I spoke with them.  Adding more insult, I checked in the car with 53 miles then checked out with almost 30 miles added - GM will not even investigate.    Also, the tire jack was not in the car (I checked that FREE option when I build up the unit I prefer).  Keyes Audi GM said the jack is available for $270 (scissor jack).

In short, I was forced to accept the car.  In November 2017, I drove the car to Las Vegas on a 4-hour trip.  Halfway my trip, the alarm sounded off.  I immediately made an emergency call to Audi Support Center.  But all they can say is to bring it back to dealership.  Having no other option. We proceeded to our destination.  The car kept beeping every couple of minutes for 2 hours!  On our way home, it still kept beeping the whole duration of the trip (4 hours!).  But the worse part was when we took a detour to Barstow, CA for a short rest, the car just slammed the break by itself and made a hard stop at the freeway off-ramp, then a louder beep sounded off with indicator lights flashing.  It was a very dangerous occurrence.  It is fortunate that it was in an isolated road at that time.  Otherwise, it could have been a serious accident.  I filed another complaint and still no commitment from dealership on my request to replace it.  The car was picked up by dealer for series of checks and repairs (3 week duration).  I finally decided to start a legal remedy and this time Audi USA took me seriously.  I was offered to have a brand new replacement but I changed my mind already and demanded for full refund.  Took couple of months of negotiation.   I got my full refund + customer loyalty $2,500 if I buy another car in the VW group. Cool Q7, but at a price get a second mortgage of your house.  this thing is way cool, with lots of gadgets and driver\\'s assist...but all that comfort comes at a price.  if one starts downgrading this thing to get something affordable, then you\\'re left with just another chevy or ford with rings on the front and back. Fantastic car! This is a wonderful car to drive whether around town or on the highway. It\\'s fun to drive and handles incredibly.. Brilliant SUV for the money. I just bought a 2018 Ink blue Q7 Prestige a couple weeks ago. The interior is well executed and made up of high quality materials. The technology is impressive, with the Virtual Cockpit being the best tech feature in the car. The 558 watt Bose 3D surround sound system delivers clear crisp sound. Performance is very impressive. The power is always there, and the fuel economy is okay. The only shortcoming is cargo volume, the low roofline doesn\\'t help. I Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a luxury SUV. Next Q7 I had own previous model of Q7 and it was great for 8 years but this one is EVEN better Q 7 \\'Q\\'uite the Catch!! Utmost quality. Drove it 14 hours straight from Missouri to Florida. Just never got tired. I was so excited to own this car. Stunning car for a 5000lb beastie Drivers middle column with stick shift is smallish in the way of compartments for your phones and keys and change, mildly irritating. The cars auto cruise control failed to see a red truck in front of me stopped at a red light and I had to hurry up to apply the brakes. Trust issues at this point. Rear hatch will not open by waving foot under sensor 8 out of 10 times. Had this car a month. Great car - Noisy breaks! Love the car but breaks make loud noise when backing up and applying break.   Brought it in for repair at Warrington Audi in Pa and they couldn\\'t fix it.  They said it was normal.  Yeah right .   What bull. Audi Q7 Great car!  Went with a used to keep cost down and it drives like a new car.  Fun to drive and roomy. Brake problem: Seriously consider this. I have a 2017 Q7 and the brakes squeal. This sound has been present since we purchased it as a new vehicle. We have called Audi USA multiple times and they claim fault and have been absolutely useless to help us resolve this issue!! This is my second Audi (A8) and given the performance I was expecting, this has been very disappointing. With this type of service of a new vehicle, be careful making an Audi purchase!! I sense Audi is just waiting for the brakes to wear out and charge us for new brakes. Anyone having a similar problem? A really great car with twitchy electronics Overall a great car with super utility.  Electronics glitches (radio/nav unit failed, security system failed/alarmed repeatedly and unexpectedly) spoiled an otherwise good experience.  Still own it but plan to sell/trade within 6 months. Would buy again if Audi could convince me that a new one would be more reliable.  Excellent dealer response overall. In love with Quinn! (Yes, I name my vehicles) Do not buy unless you want a responsive, engaging driving experience! Does not feel as big as it is. A truck that drives like a sedan You have to drive this car with the optional air suspension. The models with regular suspension has an awful ride. My q7 Prestige is the perfect combination of comfort and practicality. Two large dogs and the need to carry goods in our business has the q7 serving us well. It is head and shoulders over my prior Lexus GX 460. Must read before purchase Other reviews have done well to highlight the pros of the Q7. I won\\'t repeat those. I do think it is important for any potential buyer to understand the increased speed that you will encounter maintenance needs. First, the premature brake squeak is REAL. My brakes began to squeak at 15,000 miles. By 20,600 miles I was told that both my brakes and tires need to be replaced. Majority of my travel is commuting my kids around. Interpret that as you may, I am rather conservative on the road. A simple search will help the consumer understand that this is not unique experience and that there are numerous complaints out there. Audi has no solution in sight.  Had I known about this issue I most certainly would have made another car buying decision.  I think it is unreasonable to have these issues at 20,000 mile intervals for the life of a car and I do not see enough well-written information out there to educate buyers. THE Q7 BREAKS WILL ANNOUNCE YOUR ARRIVAL BY 2 MIN I have owned a Q7 2017 for 11 months and have been to the dealer 6 times to get the obnoxious brake noise fixed, 6 times no fix and lots of excuses! The Audi dealer in Norwell, MA does not stand behind its product and tells me that no one else is having these issues. Which is untrue according to the service people that tell me all Q7 2017 cars have this same brake noise problem. I called Audi and they told me that they are working on it, so I have a $60K car that sounds like a Sherman Tank and I am suppose to be happy with how the dealer and Audi have handled this problem. I would never buy another Audi! Engine Stop/Start drives me crazy! One expects a $70,000 vehicle to be outstanding and the Q7 deserves that merit except for 3 items.  The engine Stop/Start feature cannot be permanently disabled like our 2015 Audi A6.  I have to remember to disengage this annoying feature every time I drive this vehicle.  It is infuriating.  The second item is the runflat tires.  Audi chose to save weight and space (like many other companies) by eliminating the spare tire.   They commissioned a tire just for just this vehicle resulting in an extreme cost of $528.00 per tire!  The last item is the jack.  The Audi engineers could not find space for the jack anywhere in the vehicle, so it is unsecured in the rear cargo area making it a missile in the event of an accident.  The rear compartment is filled with the Bose stereo system and one would be hard pressed to get a toothbrush in there.  I tried under the hood and it is just as crammed. Bought it for my wife now I want one. I would not by the 2.0T it has more interior noise.  Car has been great Drove from Northern California to Arizona without any problems. There\\'s no brake noise at all most times you hear nothing but the sound of the stereo playing as you cruise down the road. I\\'ve been very happy with my purchase of the Q7. The Best I\\'ve Ever Owned Adding a wife and a teenage stepchild, I came to the realization that my Lexus IS was simply too small for my growing family.  It was a tough reality as I loved my IS.  But now that I have owned my 2017 Q7 for a little less than a year, I have come to see my situation as fortunate.  Through a ton of test drives, I came to the decision that I could not settle for anything but this Q7.  I test drove larger luxury SUV\\'s and there simply was no competition.  I\\'m an \"interior guy\", meaning it matters about the comfort and the gadgets.  And sure enough, this thing comes with EVERYTHING imaginable.  Add the connection to my iPhone and you can do about anything short of cooking a meal in the car.  Truly, this is luxury. NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE OR LEASE  AUDI Ongoing brake squel. Audi says it\\'s normal. Sounds like I had the brakes are done at People Boys. How awful. Paint finish around grille area faded off after a year of car washing. Drivers side mirror whistles while driving 40 mph and above. Audi Pre Sense goes off whenever it feels and jerks seat belts even when no other vehicle around and likes to make our hearts jump to almost a heart attack. Worst vehicle ever for price. WE COMPLAIN CONSTANTLY AND ALL AUDI SAYS ITS NORMAL, NORMAL, NORMAL. $80,000 DOLLAR WASTE. SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE FORD EXPLORER AT LEAST FORD WOULD BACK THERE PRODUCTS UNLIKE AUDI. AUDI WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT. JUST IN ------- SUNROOF NOW MAKING VIBRATION NOISES WTF. Avoid this car The brakes squeak anytime the brake is touched.  The dealer says 80% of owners are complaining.  We have asked them to relay our dissatisfaction to Audi.  Nothing gets done.  The squeaking noise is like \"fingernails down a chalkboard\".  It is embarrassing to drive the car because of the noise.  Please do not buy this car.  So disappointed in Audi\\'s customer service. nothing but trouble I must have gotten one of the first one\\'s made.Nothing but trouble, brakes, tires, jerkyride when starting off from stop,and check engine lights that would\\'t go off. Had it into the dealer 6 times in 14 months of ownership. I had enough traded it in for Highlander that is great for much less money. Beware of brake squeal issue do not buy I have a 2017 q7 with 9000 miles on it and there is a horable brake squeal that they know of the issue and have no fix in site so In Audi USA words enjoy the car with the noisy brakes until they can find out what the issue is. So I have a 70000 car that’s an embarrassment to drive. I will never recommend Aud. The company does not stand behind there products... Look the other way! Beware! 2 q7\\'s both terrible! Where should i start! What a nightmare! Leased a brand new 2017 in july of last year. To make a very long and frustrating story short what a nightmare problems out of the get go from suspension-interior and so on. No support from Audi at all just a brand new car 8,000 miles needing tons of repairs. Dealer decided to purchase the vehicle from us and being that the dealer steped-up to help us we decided to give it another try. Leased another 2017 AUDI q7 carbon gray metallic premium plus with warm weather package which meant higher payment and another down payment. Not even 24 hours into the new Q7 we had troubles with the supercharger. Should have known then it was not going to stop there. Center consoles get warped horrible design which leads into the terrible quality of the seats. we leased a Q7 with Warm weather package due to heated/ a/c seats hoping that these seats would wear better. NOPE front driver  seat 2nd row seat and 3rd row seats all need replacement. Drivre side front window needs window regulator slow roll down and noise.Drivers door has a pop sound which we have been trying to chase for 5 months. Have fun trying to close the doors 5x . Oh and don\\'t forget squeaky brakes around 6-9k miles still no fix in site for that.  Ours for some odd reason has a rough idle and the other day just decided to start shaking and feeling like it wanted to accelerate while foot was on brake. YUP vehicle is at the dealer currently AUDI customer support/service no help and terrible  attitudes. Timing to get issues handled with AUDI is the worst. Being my first AUDI experience i would never ever do it again nor refer anyone to purchase or lease. I can only hope this review will save someone else a huge headache / loss of money! I just wait for this thing to break down again and/or for the next interior part to break. Worth the wait. I have 3 BMW X5 and love these SUV\\'s however wanted a change. The new Q5 is very attractive but limited towing capacity and with production just starting in Mexico I was hesitant to purchase. Q7 Pros:-fit & finish, driver comfort, Bose sound system & electronics. Cons:- Exterior is a little boring and boxy, rear seat comfort, 16 week delivery lead time but worth the wait! Exceptional car!  LOVE it! We based our purchase primarily on the Consumer Reports discussion of safety technology (side-view cam, auto stop, etc) . Rated #1 by far. However, the car also looks great and handles exceptionally well. The interior is true luxury with every possible amenity. It will be weeks before we read through the whole manual and get everything set the way we want! It\\'s a little un-nerving when your smartCAR and smartPHONE are both smarter than WE are. It could use a few more \"luxury\" touches on the exterior - is pretty plain as is. A fun SUV Consumers report states, \"may be the best SUV they have ever tested\". watch out for the squeaky brakes know before you buy/lease Q7 electronics will stop your car:big safety issue I customized my car and got it July of 2016.  My car has been into the dealerships for pre sensor issues 5 times.  Service department always stated that they can replicate my issues and the car was driving as is and designed. They reset my car to manufacture twice and adjusted my cameras grasping for some sort of an explanation.    My car stopped me at a turn light and shuts off.  Then it presence went on in bumper to bumper traffic and my seat belt choked back on me when there was no reason to. My fuel injector malfunctioned at 6000 miles.  Because they can\\'t duplicated the concerns, they dubbed the car safe.  As a driver and my car stops for false pretense detection that could put my life at risk and possible a fatal accident.  It\\'s definite a huge safety concern that I\\'m having a headache with.  Even with a captured video, what cannot be duplicated becomes the consumers fault. https://youtu.be/txjonKMic1U  Audi service department could not grasp my problem, so I only got service... but I never got the ease of mind for safety, nor the customer satisfaction that my car was fix and safe to drive.  They would hope that they fix it, until my car started shutting off or stopping me.  My car was in the service department more than I could drive it for my sensors and electronic malfunction that puts me at risks.  They descriminated my gender for the lack of knowledge on handling the car.  But they were never able to explain what happened to to my car in my video I have attached. Spend on what\\'s important I have a few audi\\'s with all trim levels. I opted for the 3.0 premium with cold weather and electronics package with nav and apple play. The vehicle has so many electronic/control idiosyncratic problems that day to day use is not pleasant. Bluetooth functions poorly and makes its own choices as to wether it works or not. The shifter is so odd it’s dangerous and putting the second row down is an operation. It’s very large with somewhat poor visibility and poor gas mileage. I have my 3rd A6 and that is close to the perfect car, this is my last Q7 New Audi Driver Expensive, but loaded with the latest safety features.  Rides and handles great.  Unbelievably quiet. Great Vehicle But expensive Great Vehicle But expensive. They could have added extra features for the cost. Value for money thumbs down. Vehicle quality and driving experience great  Great car but horrible service at dealership This is the first time we purchased an Audi - we were sold by the excellent interior and a new, understated style that comes with the 2017 model. Let me start off by stating that we did not regret buying the car. We\\'ve since taken it for two long distance road trips and we throughly enjoyed this new car: generous space, elegant and comfy cockpit. The building quality is superb. There are some minor issues which are not uncommon for a new model: there was a high-pitch noise coming out of the side mirror at 40MPH+; some of the features do not work consistently (e.g. easy seat entry - the steering column is supposed to retract when the car is switched off); the Nav is not as easy to use as those offered by other manufactures (we had a Lexus RX before whose Nav, despite from 8 years ago, was extremely well designed and easy to use). Having said that, the dealership I bought the car from - at Bridgewater NJ -  is HORRIBLE. The only time they are responsive was at the time of sale. Once the car leaves the lot, you just won\\'t hear from them. I contacted them couple of times for the issues stated above and for the key code they forgot to give to me - which I need for Audi Connect. Never heard from them. I finally drove up to their office, at which point they claimed they fired the service rep who apparently has been stonewalling all their customers. Well, how I wish that was the only bad apple! I had to make another trip to the dealership after I heard nothing from them for many weeks only to be told that they have assigned my case to another rep who conveniently was not in that day. After another few weeks without hearing anything from the \"new\" rep - all the while I was calling their office and even asking Audi US office to help - I had to drive up to the dealership again. This time I asked for the sale manager and told him that I wanted an answer from him directly. This guy, their sale manager, PROMISED to my face, that he would definitely get back to me within a week, \"before next Friday\"... Well, Fridays have come and gone and it\\'s been more than a month yet not a single word from anyone at that dealership. Granted, those issues (e.g. missing key code) are mostly annoyance, not exactly life threatening. But you expect  certain service when you buy a $60,000+ car and want to have some trust in the dealership that they will take care of certain problems when needed. It\\'s a shame because honestly we like the car, but the poor customer service has put a huge dent in our enthusiasm and adds a significant doubt as to how long we should hold on to this car.Update 8-2017: The experience with the service department at this dealership has been better than the sales side - yes I have been using their service despite the really bad experience with their sales because of the location and convenience. They are still not as responsive as I would expect when it comes to schedule appointments etc but they do get the job done on time once I get the car in and the folks at the service department are courteous and some of them even go out of their way to help. Houston we have a problem This car looks like a spaceship inside, which is pretty cool.  We got the grey color with the optics package.  It\\'s a pretty awesome car....... So it appears.  However, on day 2 of ownership and approximately 100 miles we are already having reliability issues.  Today we got a \"safety system error\" yellow light on the dash indicating that the airbag is malfunctioning.  In addition, on 3 occasions the car has literally turned itself off by itself when we place it in park.  This happened one at the aim and twice when switching drivers in front of the house.  I\\'m not talking about the engine turning off to save fuel, I\\'m talking about completely off to the point we have to hit start again for the car to reboot.  Active lane assist is also nonoperative for some reason. At 70k we could have purchased 2 more reliable Kia\\'s. SUV shopping fatigue We looked, drove : Mercedes , Volvo, Infinity, Acura:  Test drive of the Q7 SOLD us on the quality, ride, quiet, workmanship of this impressive vehicle. I was worried about being \"too big\" , but drives & handles super. Would strongly recommend the 6CYL engine upgrade. The ride control/performance choices provide varied and even \"fun\" options. The graphics option of virtual dash well worth the extra dollars...Navigation visually is  outstanding with large picture in front of drivers view & adjustable via steering wheel controls. Unfortunately the ease, ability to use navigation system overly complicated, frustrating and ends up i don\\'t use it ...I use my phone. Such a waste of technology . Did they really have a focus group trying out the system? Not overly impressed with sound system , but BOSE upgrade pricy for sure...if you can afford it ...do it! Really like the panoramic large moon roof. All in all, and because of a \"year end special deal\" this Q7 was clear choice over the competition. A lot of car but a lot of money This is really an adult car and not a kid carrier.  I went for the adaptive chassis which gives the Q7 amazing road holding. This car is loaded with technology.  Audi should hold classes the way Apple does to familiarize the owner with everything this car is capable of doing. You have the ability to control all the cameras; that means you can get front, rear, side, and 360-degree views at will.  The driver\\'s seat is really a cockpit seat giving you access to heads up technology, and ability to control the dashboard display to meet your immediate needs whether it be fuel consumption or directional maps. The only real downside to the car is storage. The glove compartment is barely able to hold the manuals; and the center console might store a pack of gum.  If you drop all the rear seats then you can fit in groceries or a set of golf clubs. I would urge you to purchase the extended warranty as everything in this car is digital or electronic, including the shift; and that will take a bit of time to adjust to.  The only thing that still has a rotating knob is the radio volume on the steering wheel. It\\'s a good that that through MyAudi online that you can view a number of instructional videos that help explain the car\\'s technology. And when driving the car, be careful, because it is so quiet that you can and will exceed the posted speed limits. A great driving experience but it is an expensive driving experience when you have the prestige package. It has been a year,  and I do like this car.  I have figured out most of the tech and am just disappointed in the recurring monthly charge to keep maps and all up to date.  That runs twenty bucks a month. Given the sudden changes in weather we have been experiencing, I am pleased I am in a mobile mini-fortress. Even with all the safety features it is still worthwhile to remember no one can drive on ice.I have had the Q-7 for a while now and still enjoy its major benefits as drivability, acceleration, comfort, and safety. But front storage is still a problem that can\\'t be fixed. The official Audi app is close to useless, and Audi should pull it from the market period. Overall the Q-7 is a superb driving machine. It\\'s relatively new but we love everything, almost Update: Everything on the initial review still applies 5,000 miles later.Original review: This is a very high quality vehicle.  Overall it is excellent, but there are some areas that need to be considered based on your needs. More on that later.   The ride, handling, and quietness is far superior to the 2010 Lexus RX350 that we traded on this.  I also find the seats to be significantly more comfortable.  After an hour in the RX350 I was already adjusting the seat due to discomfort.  Not with the Audi.  The virtual cockpit and all the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, side assist, pre-sense, etc.) LED adaptive headlights are fantastic and have worked flawlessly.  This does not drive OR ride like an SUV.  You easily forget you are driving a large SUV.  For those actually looking for a seven passenger vehicle, there are several things to consider.  We just had our third grandchild, so the ability to put three car seats across the 2nd row was a must.  The car seats barely fit in the RX350; making it very difficult to fasten the seat belt on the high back booster.  Not a problem with the Q7 since there is approximately three additional inches between the arm rests.  HOWEVER, we also wanted a seven passenger SUV so we could take their mom and dad, if necessary.  Only way to do that was to put two of the forward facing seats in the third row.  Grandkids loved it but difficult to connect belts, etc.  Plus it was necessary to put the rear facing infant car seat in middle position of second row , in order to fold and flip the outer seats for access to the 3rd row.  If that car seat is too wide, you are unable to flip / fold the outer seats.  Measure carefully before you buy if you have similar needs.  Cargo capacity with the third row seat backs in the up positions is significantly inadequate.  For those planning to vacation with seven, this is not the vehicle, unless you don\\'t mind buying one of those roof top carriers that make you look like the Griswalds.  I really was not thrilled with the fact that the Q7 only comes with Run on Flat tires.  There are very few manufacturers that make the 20\" tires (Goodyear) that our Prestige has so you have to wonder how many tire shops within a 50 mile radius would have a replacement tire in the event of a tire failure.  I read horror stories about ROF tires, but ride quality, noise, and handling are not an issue in the Q7.  Due to all the technology there will be a very steep learning curve. Comfortable Luxury but not perfect. Based on just 200 miles of driving this is a very comfortable car with great technology.  I have the Prestige trim as many of the features I wanted were standard.  I has the heads up display which is great except for one small fault.  The plastic frame around the lens in the dash is smooth.  At some angles sunlight will create a bit of glare around the edges of the display.  They are low enough not to be in the line of sight but I would have expected the engineers to realize this and make the frame out of a material that reduces glare.  The vehicle also comes with run flat tires and does not have a spare although it comes with a jack with no place to stow it so it isn\\'t in the way.  It has a can similar to something like fix-a-flat.  Reviews on the mileage expected on the tires is not encouraging and a quick search for replacement tires (21\") on shows two manufacturers (Goodyear & Continental) with a price per tire near $500.  The interior is very nice.  The one drawback is the lack of storage bins.  There are only two small bins.  The one under the arm rest will hold a pair of sunglasses but leaves only a little room for anything else.  The CD player is located in the glove box so if you want to play a CD you have to load it before you start driving.  The virtual cockpit allows you to do many things without taking your hands off the steering wheel.  Functions like the radio and phone can be selected and controlled on the steering wheel so you don\\'t have to look to the side to make a call or change the radio station.  The blind spot warning lights are on the side mirrors cover and are easier to see than just a small emblem on the mirror.  The speed limit for most streets is displayed on the instrument panel and the heads up display.  You can set a reminder that will cause the posted speed limit to flash if you exceed it more than the amount you set.  A very nice reminder in residential areas.  It also lets you know if you are in a school zone although it will still flash as if you are speeding even when school is not in session.  My wife has a very hard time pulling straight into a parking spot.  The parking assist will display your position in the parking spot so if you are at an angle or taking up two spots you can see it before you exit the car.  This is a great car (a little pricey) if you know the small shortcomings.After 5000 miles I still enjoy driving the Q7.  I love the heads up display.  I won\\'t buy another care without it.  It took a little while to learn to use the adaptive cruise control and I don\\'t drive on the freeway anymore without using it.  It does have a few quirks though.  The set speed automatically adjusts downward with a decreased speed limit which is good but it sometimes reduces speed even though there is no change in the speed limit.  This is especially true if the road had a long term construction project.  The cameras will also occasionally miss an increase in the posted speed so the speed sign will flash until you pass another speed sign and this can be for many miles.  The camera doesn\\'t recognize all the signs indicating the end of a school zone so it will also flash until you finally come across another speed limit sign.  There are a  couple of irritants.  The drivers door has developed a rattle when driving over a slightly rough road and the dealership hasn\\'t been able to fix.   (I didn\\'t have this rattle after 100k miles on my Lexus SUV.)  Also the steering wheel is slightly \"off\" level.  That is if I put the steering wheel \"level\" the car will move to the right and it this includes driving in a parking lot.  The dealer checked the alignment and said it is ok but it still does it.  The backup sensor is nice but when I have a bike rack in the trailer hitch the warning tone is constant when backing up so you don\\'t get a sense about how close you are to objects behind you based on the tone.  The car computes the estimated miles remaining before the next fill up but it tends to over estimate the gas mileage so it can be up to 100 miles  less than indicated on the display.  It is more noticeable when driving long distances on an interstate highway.After 14000 miles I like the car.  I had to have the motor that controls the driver side mirror replaced.  This required resetting the cameras that are used in to indicate car position ( lane & parking) and it took all day.  They also looked at the door rattle.  They could hear it bout couldn’t find the source.  A manufacturer rep said it was the seals so they applied something to the seals.  The door still rattles.  The MMI connect which give you info about the car is now incorrectly telling me a window is open.  I had to make an appointment to get it fixed.  I just drove on a 4K mile trip.  It doesn’t get near the advertised mpg.  There is a screen that gives you the mpg for the trip nut it is off 3 to 4 mpg.  (Checked at every fill up.). The engine seems to burn small amount of oil.  Trailer hitch can’t be locked. No spare tire! We enjoyed the test drive and were thinking serious about this SUV. Good looking and good finishes made this attractive in comparison to the X5 and GLE 350. Drove great.  We found the technology a little cumbersome but that could be expected as it was new to us but not as difficult as other test drives. The navigation voice commands could not recognize very much. The salesman indicated that it would get used to our voices. Right.  I checked this out with a current owner. He confirmed that voice commands are limited to his contact list.  The kicker for me was there was no spare tire! The salesman went looking for it and could not find it! It was sorta funny but it wasn\\'t.  Their defense was it was equipped was run-flat tires with a 50 mile range. That may work for city slickers but we go to remote locations and that won\\'t hunt. The  X5 also has no spare.  I understand that this is becoming more common but its not for me. Exciting only in Dynamic mode I have been considering this car, but I wanted to have a real testing experience before actually shelling out $60,000+.  So, I was able to rent this car for 1 week (it costs me some, but I think it is worth to avoid a costly mistake). I put about 1,000 miles on the car driving on all kind of terrains in Southern California, except in snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FUEL ECONOMY. In auto mode and 60-40 highway/city I was getting a respectable 23.5mpg in Auto mode. On a long stretch of freeway I achieved 25mpg as claimed. In Dynamic mode, the fuel economy suffers immediately as the car shifts and revs up more. On the same 60-40 highway/city I could only get 21.5mpg. I was not driving slow and, in fact, I got it up to 100mph on several occasions; as usual, the \"secret\" is to accelerate gradually.                        DRIVING EXPERIENCE: It is boring (Lexus RX 350 sort of feeling) in Auto mode. More exciting (BMW X5 sort of thing) in Dynamic mode. I was actually surprised by how agile and stable the car is going uphill at good speeds in Dynamic mode. A true Dr. Jeckyll  and Mr. Hide sort of personality.   The car is long, but parallel parking is actually easier than I was expecting. Mind you, I said easier and not easy. Without the rearview camera and at night in dark areas, it is not completely a \"piece of cake\". Driving uphill on serious pitches like in Old-Town San Diego was more pleasant that I hoped for. I was a tad concerned on some pitches when I had to come to a complete stop, but the car proved excellent.                                                                          NOISE: Wind noise in more than on the BMW X5, at least once I hit 80mph-ish.. Road noise is definitely low. Excellent in that sense.                                      INTERIORS It is well detailed, it not exceptionally luxurious, at least not in the Premium or Premium plus trims. Unfortunately, the Luxury package (another $6k) is available only in the Prestige trim.   The car is comfortable, but not exceptionally comfortable. I am 6\\'2\" and 245lbs, and on a 4 hour + driving I wished the car had a better support for my thighs . The seats feel comfortable, but after hours of driving, did not feel that comfy anymore.  The double shade panels in front are an excellent touch. I wonder why more cars do not have them since that is an inexpensive feature..                          INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM.  I rent many high end cars, so I am quite familiar with the bells and whistles of infotainment systems, and I have learned tricks on one car that carry over, so to speak to a different brand, but it took me about one day to learn 80%+ of all functions.  For example, getting ambient lights and set them up is not completely intuitive and I had to watch a video on YouTube that taught me how to get it done choosing the colors (you must have the proper package for it, though).  The navigation system is pretty good and I do like the fact that it is higher up, although I use the one on my console while driving. But I would prefer a larger screen. I think that both Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 are better visually speaking.  But it got me where I needed to go and it provided good directions in all situations except one where it kept sending me up a steep and narrow street only, we found out, to cut the driving distance by about 50-100 yards.   BRAKING.  It is overall fine, but in two instances I found myself wishing it could be a little more prompt. But that could just be me and the fact that I am used to a different car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            LIGHTS: The Q7 lighting system ranks among the good ones. Drove it at night on hilly and narrow roads with nothing in terms of street lights and I always felt that I had a good view of the road, in particular using the high beam lights.                                                                                                                        OVERALL GRADE (A-): It has about all a driver would want, but it is fun to drive only in Dynamic mode.  The visual luxury is all there, but it is not 100% comfortable. Can be improved... but still great overall Recently made a switch from \\'13 BMW X5 50i to a \\'17 Q7 Prem Plus. Great car with lots of updates in tech and safety. Comfortable and quiet. While the engine has the punch in \\'dynamic\\' mode, it lacks in \\'auto\\' mode due to the tranny not shifting when needed. Going up a hill or trying to pass a vehicle requires a brick foot. Granted, I came from a turbo-charged V8 but expected more from the tranny which probably would make up the difference. The auto-start/stop isn\\'t great when stopping - as if I am slamming on the brake b/c the engine shuts off before the car comes to a complete stop. The middle-rear seat cushion does not appear to be fixed in place as it shifts slightly - probably bringing it in to have it checked out. The tire jack tools have no where to be stored and sits in the trunk. One would think a small storage compartment can be built in somewhere for it. As some others have mentioned, when the phone is plugged in to USB for Carplay, you can no longer use the blue tooth function and have to go through the Carplay menu to make calls. I have not been able to hit the manufacturer\\'s gas mileage of 19 city/25 highway/21 combined. So far locally I am getting 15 mpg or less and 20 mpg on highways. This is less than my V8 X5 which was consistent 17/21 mpg. For the pros, lighting for the vehicle is great inside and out.  Drive is very smooth and quiet; curious to see if that changes when the run-flats are worn in. It would seem I\\'ve been more critical than happy so far... I am just starting to get comfortable with the changes and hopefully it will get better over time. Overall, I am happy with the vehicle. Let\\'s hope it is reliable and will last and retain good re-sale value. A big headache! I own a new 2017 Q7 for 7 months and it\\'s currently 6500 miles. I love the esthetics and the drive but the electronics of this car are absolutely terrible! Don\\'t buy this car! I have had  a steering wheel malfunction in this car 4 time where all the controls in the steering wheel stop working, -and next day everything is working again! . I took it to Audi 3 times and they can\\'t figure it out! Also the rear camera doesn\\'t work every time it rains. My volume button stopped working temporarily 3 times! My oil change light went off when it wasn\\'t due for an oil change. The light went off the next day by itself.  There is a clicking noise everytime I start the car. Like a processor sound. I took the car to Audi and none of the issues where fixed yet.  I am planning to apply to lemon laws. hesitation The Q7 2015 has inconsistent hesitation upon acceleration  which is a safety concern when pulling into traffic.  Not a happy Audi buyer. I am glad I made right choice. I was looking a car for couple months. I compared SUVs from Volvo, Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lexus. Audi Q7 is the best one. Two weeks review - Still in the honeymoon Car is super easy to drive. Super quiet too. Any size concerns related to parking go away with the visual package and the 360 view. As I am breaking in the engine I have not pushed any pedal to the limit but I can sense the power that this engine can provide and I am confident that I will be as impressed as I was with the demo car. Materials and ergonomics are top notch. I recommend to get the visual package because you get the LED lights, the extra cameras and the virtual cockpit which I have found very useful. I also got the Bose 3D sound system. If you are thinking on buying this car, you must listen to the standard sound system and compare. For me it was money well spent. On the negatives, I do not think that you will be able to get more mileage than what they advertised, I have been very reasonable as I am breaking in the engine and I am not getting more than 20mpg combined. The other thing is that sometimes I have to reestablish the Bluetooth connection in the phone to make it work. I have not found the pattern that causes that yet, hopefully the Audi guys tell me if I am doing something wrong next time I go there. Overall, a great experience so far. It is not cheap but you may not have a better option if you want to have a luxury 3-row SUV that performs and looks good for a family guy.10k update: Car keeps driving great and fuel economy got to 21.5 miles/gal. Two minor issues: climate control cannot be synch-ed from the driver controls, you have to manually do it. You have to look at the temperature in the second row as well. Not ideal for a car of this price. One of the speakers will have to be changed as it has a raspy sound in some specific range. It will be covered under the warranty. All things considered, still very happy. Pleasure to drive.20k update. Very pleased with the car. All works as expected. Pleasure to drive. I bounce between the auto and comfort drive mode. Fuel economy a little above 22 mpg now. I extended the satellite radio service. I have not extended the Audi google map and news service, I think that it is too expensive and they should offer a more competitive price or maybe separate the google map connectivity from the rest of the features. Without the google map service your navigation system works but it is not smart. It will not update route based on traffic. If you want that you will need to use the Apple service through car play. 2017-12-13 Update after 16,000 miles This car drives great.  It\\'s electronics are far inferior to that on my Lincoln MKT.  The navigation system suddenly reboots during trips.  The voice activated system apparently only speaks German, as it doesn\\'t understand English.  6/12/17:  Pros:  Car drives great on a long trip, and gets good mileage.  Averaged better than 25 mpg on 780 mile trip from Georgia to Maryland.  Comfort better than average.  Excellent braking system.  Cons:  Repeated navigation system failures where the system suddenly \"reboots\" while driving!  Of course, Audi cannot replicate in the shop!  All data is lost and the trip has to be re-programmed into the system.  Car still leaks going through a car wash.  Audi solution, turn off the A/C when in a car wash!  Key fob suddenly stopped recognizing the car.  Audi reprogrammed.  Said \"it happens sometimes.\"  Self-leveling system pump is so loud when it runs it can be heard above the radio, and I am partially deaf!  It sounds like someone is filling a tire with air!  There is no dip stick to check the oil.  You have to turn on the car, and page through the settings to find the \"check oil screen.\"  Then it will tell you the oil level, sometimes.  Other times it doesn\\'t seem to work.  The technology on this car is great, when it works.  I have had multiple failures and many more problems then I ever had on my Lincoln MKT.  This is my first and last Audi.12/11/16:  My car was returned from service for this issue after 14 days in the shop.  The mechanic\\'s comments on my receipt follow:   \"Took vehicle thru car wash with A/C on. Found water coming from the bottom of the dash. Removed wiper cowl cover and air intake ducting. No damage to seals or evidence of leaking. Ran vehicle thru car wash again using borascope to watch inside housing intake. Found when foam from car wash hits it is sucked into the vent box. Removed housing from another vehicle and found it did the same thing. Contacted product support. Was advised this condition is \"normal\" and vehicle needs to be in recirculation mode or A/C OFF while going through a car wash!\"So according to Audi those of us living in the south should turn off our A/C or put it in recirculation mode to go through a car wash?  This is my 20th new automobile.  I have never had to do any such thing with any other brand.  I\\'ll be trading back to Lincoln next year.  I miss my MKT.This is my first Audi.  I have always purchased Lincolns, but they discontinued the MKT.  I traded my 2011 MKT on a new 2017 Audi Q7 equipped nicely with $66,000 worth of bells and whistles.  I should have kept the MKT!  I first noticed the car leaking when my wife and I drove it through a car wash and water dripped onto her feet.  We returned to the dealer in Jacksonville.  After many hours they reported they could not \"replicate\" the problem.  They said they blew out all the drains, etc. and hopefully our problem was solved.  10 days go by and I visit the car wash again.  Drip, drip, drip into the passenger cabin with about a cup of water during a 2 minute trip through the automated car wash!  I filed a written complaint with the dealer and management.  The service writer called me (not a peep from anyone in management).  He had the car picked up at my home (117 miles from the dealership).  It has been there 7 days now and the last report I received on Thursday (today is Sunday) is that they were going to drive it through a car wash!  No kidding?  It has not rained since I purchased the car.  We are about to take it on a 1500 mile trip to see the grandkids.  I am extremely worried the car will flood if we run into rain!  This is supposed to be a LUXURY automobile!  The electronics are flaky for the radio, and the navigation system is a throw back to the system I had in my Lincoln in 2006!  No touch screen!  A stupid knob to turn to enter data one character at a time!  The MMI system works sometimes, other times it doesn\\'t seem to connect unless I turn off the car, and restart it.  The entertainment system has crashed and rebooted several times without explanation.  As I stated earlier, this is my first Audi.  It will also be my last.  Poor dealer service and response, a leaky brand new luxury automobile, and no response whatsoever from management.  Do yourself a favor and find another vehicle. 2017 Audi Prestige W/Air suspension review Absolutely love the car. I\\'ve only had it since October 9th, but it has a great feeling of quality and solidity. The interior is well made and of high quality components. Seats are good, but I would expect sears that have upper seat back movement like in BMW\\'s comfort seats. Without that the headrest seems too high or too low. Coming from a 2015 BMW X5, I am left missing the transmission calibration of the BMW, even though they have the same trans. It\\'s quick to upshift and makes me have to kick down when I think I shouldn\\'t. Also, because Audi doesn\\'t make enough of the Q7\\'s, they are in demand and the dealers use that to their benefit. (Pretty much plan on no incentives and no discount on price) Overall I\\'m very happy with my purchase, and would do it again.Starting just over 10,000 Miles, the brakes started making a horrible squeaking and squealing noise coming to a stop and backing up. VERY LOUD. Audi dealer says Audi NA is aware and working on a fix.... I’m still driving around with it noisy and unacceptable. Better Than Even the Best Reviews If you are interested in this vehicle you likely have read the many terrific reviews from Motorweek, Car and Driver, and even Consumer Reports. I certainly did. I was able to get the vehicle at a small discount which was lucky as some dealers are now asking above sticker or loading on even more packs. The car is a joy to drive and while some have compared the \"Virtual Cockpit\" to a video game, I find it helpful and very effective at communicating information, which is what a dash should do. The placement of controls is excellent, and they are well organized by function. The volume control for all uses (voice, phone, audio) is delightfully located on the console where one\\'s hand naturally falls. The shifter takes a while to get used to, but Audi seems to have anticipated a learning curve. When I first owned it I tried to put it in reverse without stepping on the brake pedal. The dash lit up to inform me I needed to do so. There are a few issues. First, interior storage for the driver is simply unavailable. The console holds virtually nothing and there is not even a sunglass holder. The absences of cubbies is a disappointment, but certainly not a deal breaker. I have had two minor problems. First, one day the alarm system went off every time I tried to lock the vehicle. The dealer (only a mile away, happily) was able to remedy this in less than an hour. Second, the steering wheel is no longer centered after only 2,500 miles. That, too, will be corrected by the dealer. Overall, it\\'s a terrific vehicle as far as I am concerned, despite minor issues.Update, April 2017: Car sat for much of the winter as I had to have emergency back surgery. As soon as I was able, I was driving again, and my very positive impression of the driver\\'s seat was reconfirmed the moment I sat in it again. Very supportive, but not confining. Was able to drive 6 hours (with breaks) and no discomfort. Got stuck in stop-and-go traffic entering Chicago (no surprise) and the Traffic Jam Assist feature, previously untested, worked perfectly. Very impressive. With cruise control set at 73 I got a steady 26+ MPG. Around town am averaging about 22.5. Overall, VERY pleased with vehicle.Update, October 2017: Still very happy with this vehicle. The longer I own it, the more impressed I am with the subtle benefits of Audi\\'s technology. The touch pad works very well, and the audio is amazing. I still remain slightly irritated by the absence of small-item storage for the driver. After 15 months, the build quality is evident. I am delighted overall.Update: April, 2018: Remain very pleased with the vehicle, but as in any long-term relationship some of the bloom does go off the rose. One annoying problem has arisen--noisy brakes when in reverse under most weather condition. Horrendous squeal. Dealer says Audi is \"working on a fix\" but that they were having similar problems with the Q5 (not sure if he meant the new model or the pre-2018). The \"fix\" for the Q5 has not worked well and dealer has no idea when Audi will be able to correct this annoyance. And a few more minor gripes: Why does Audi choose when the headlight washers come on? In previous vehicles, I could do this manually. With Audi, certain parameters must be met before the system operates automatically, or so I am lead to believe. I am not sure they have ever come on. I still wish that Audi had come up with some storage solutions for the driver\\'s cockpit and elsewhere (no storage for the jack??) So, yes, I am increasingly aware that this is an imperfect vehicle in minor ways, but would not hesitate to buy it again. It\\'s still a terrific drive! Car is just alright. I\\'ve switched from Mercedes. Handling is nicer, not as nice as BMW though. Cabin is very quiet. First impression is amazing. Nicely designed and finished. As soon as you start driving it you realize run flat tires destroy the comfort you may like from Mercedes. Head up display, as Paul already mentioned, produces ugly glares on a windscreen, right in front of you, distracting and destroying the whole experience of having a head up display technology. The best you can do when the glare comes up is to use a paper towel or something else to cover it up. Turning it off doesn\\'t help as glare is a reflection from the HUD optics, not an image from the projector. Driver assistance package seems like an interesting enhancement but the car doesn\\'t fully stop itself as advertised. You better read about all the limitations etc. The last one and a very annoying issue it the air-conditioning. The level of the noise the funs produce on a sunny days is hard to bear.  If I had the money in my pocket again I would seriously consider other vehicles like GLS or XC90. Perhaps this is what I\\'m going to do. Wait for the new GLS and trade it in. Good luck. problems I love my Q7, but I\\'m having problems already and have only owned it since the end of June. The hatch has a tendency to not to want to open and it makes a screeching noise when it does open. You have to try and pull it up enough to shut it so you can try and open it again. I\\'ve had it in for a fix and all they did was a master reset. What good is that really going to do?? Ha, nothing, as it is happening again. I\\'m pretty sure the pre sense is not working. I\\'ve had a couple close calls where it should have and it didn\\'t work.  But they tell me it is. I\\'ve just started having issues with the key remembering my settings. I have had to push the button several times now to get it where I have it set for me.  I\\'m wondering if I made a mistake buying this Audi. :( I got rid of my explorer because I was constantly bringing it in for the same problems they couldn\\'t seem to get fixed right. I don\\'t want to have to be doing that again! An honest feedback. Head up display optics produce glares which at times can be very distracting. They can be small i.e. two bright points or it can appear as two bright lines, or (pretty bad) large and very bright, and rather large (size of a credit card) spot. If you live in California or any other place with plenty of sun, test drive the car in the middle of the day and make sure you can live with this issue. This alone can be a road block. Side mirrors produce a high pitch noise. Turn off the radio while test driving and listen carefully to the mirrors. In windy days it can be very obvious and annoying. Driver assistance system is far worse than the one you can find on a brand new Volvo XC 90. It is confirmed by IIHS. Test drive both cars and you will see what I mean. Major concerns on quality of the materials used. This may not be a perfect option for demanding person paying attention to details. An honest feedback.

Non intuitive instrumentation but otherwise great  Q7 redesign is missing simple options I just bought the 2017 Q7.  It\\'s disturbing that the skimped on some of the features found on lesser vehicles.  Here\\'s my bucket list of the features that this car should have came with:  1.  Remote start from key fob.  2.  Convex overhead mirror (to watch the kiddos in the back)  3.  Wireless charging the cockpit (they missed it, even with all the technology), vents in the 3rd row (this is standard on all 3rd row vehicles.  this is a huge mistake.)  4.  Driver\\'s key pad for vehicle entry (Ford may be the only company doing this).  5.  Sunglass holder (pretty simple option).   6.  Basic Tire Pressure monitoring system (they have some formula with the sensors to tell you if the tire pressure changes.  Just use a standard TPMS valve).  I\\'m happy with the car, but at this price point the car should have these basic features.  I would also have to agree with the comment about the run flats.  Run flats are a huge disadvantage all around.  I haven\\'t got into the maintenance phase yet, but I\\'ll update my post at that time. Love  it Love  it NAVIGATION SUCKS EVEN MORE WITH USE The navigation system is poor and confusing. You have to manually change state location even if have driven there.  The electronic handbrake can be activated while car is in gear - very dangerous. Map/ Navigation systems poorly described.  Manual describes all options, not what is available in that vehicle - very confusing. After 6 months, the confusion between map and navigation systems remains a major, stupid problem. Q7 test drive Nice car. Being in texas, I didn\\'t  like the perforated  sun roof cover In the shop 7 times for Sunroof/rattling issues Poorly made,  bad fit and finish in interior. Horrible rattling after only 1500 mi. God knows what this car will sound like a year from now. This car was rushed to market, not ready for primetime. If you do not mind a car that will rattle over every bump, then this is your car, But if that sort of thing bothers you?- RUN dont\\' buy Refreshed Q7 The new Audi Q7 is more nimbler and more comfortable than its predecessor. Once in the vehicle it is hard not to take it out for a long drive. I am hoping Audi has invested in good parts and produce better reliability. Probably the best 3 row SUV My wife and I drove every minivan and 3 row crossover.  Rather than going into the pros and cons of every one, I will just say we chose the Q7 because of its tremendous balance between ride and handling, its superior quietness and solid feeling, and combined comfort of the first and second rows.  We also suspect that the Audi will be more reliable than the Volvo XC90 (although the Volvo is somewhat less expensive, has superior interior design and has a more comfortable first and third row).   While the Q7 cost more money than we needed to spend, I believe it is worth every dollar.  So do many others.  In my area, every Q7 was spoken for.  I purchased mine from a dealer 200 miles away, Audi at it\\'s Finest This is the first Audi we\\'ve owed and love it!  We’ve been loyal fans of Mercedes and Range Rovers over the past few years and were looking for a 7 passenger vehicle as our kids are in various sporting activities. We are only a month in and really impressed with the gas mileage.  Spacious vehicle, comfortable ride and handles the road well. I will admit I do like the body style of the older versions as I like to sit up a little higher similar to an SUV, but so far, no other complaints. 2017 Audi Q7 This car is a huge improvement from my previous 2014 Q7.  Drives like a car, loaded with technology, and has a great interior with high quality finish.  A little pricey, but so far very happy with the purchase. Amazing ride I have to say that the 2017 Q7 premium plus is a great ride.   I am really impressed with the virtual cockpit integration.   It was a great buy. Best Vehicle I Have Owned I replaced a 2011 Q7 S-Line with 100,000 miles with the new 2017.  I had some apprehension buying another Q7 mainly due to the user interface to the navigation/entertainment (MMI) system along with the very poor keyless entry system on my 2011.  The 2011 was frustrating on a good day, basically a great car destroyed by bad programming but the engine/transmission combination was awesome.  So I test drove the 2017 with my list of frustrations and likes from my 2011 vehicle and was very happy to see that most all of my concerns had been fixed or greatly improved upon in the 2017.  So I factory ordered another Q7, with everything but the driver assistance package and the Bang & Olufsen sound system.I drive 120+ miles everyday so I am very focused on driver comfort, safety features and ease of use on all features.  This car excels in all areas.  It is extremely quiet and there is no road noise from the tires.  Engine responsiveness is still exceptional.Gas mileage is surprisingly good as I am averaging around 25MPG at average driving speeds of around 75MPH.  I liked the 2011 as it got about 20MPG and combined with the 26 gallon fuel tank it had great range.  The range is just as good on the 2017 despite the smaller (22.5 gallon) fuel tank. User interface to the entertainment/navigation system is much easier and more configurable and does not require you to take your eyes of the road to find the correct button.  The heads up indication of speed, cruise control speed setting and navigational turns is excellent, not sure I can ever do without this in the future!  The keyless entry is still bizarre and its built in \"safety features\" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  The ability to utilize the map on the driver\\'s dash display is very nice to have.Keyless entry is still bizarre, the logic behind the \"personal safety feature \" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  I am frequently cussing out some unknown Audi programming or product management team somewhere unknown....  My advice to the Audi programming team is to go try a Lexus keyless entry system, it always works and lets you in the car.  Also, I have given up on the  hands free tailgate opening.  I end up dancing in the parking lot and ultimately just pull out the remote.Seating comfort with the luxury package is excellent and highly configurable.Probably the biggest improvement is in the longevity of the tires and brakes.  I currently have 53,000 miles on the vehicle and I still have 6-7 mm of tread remaining on the original factory Eagle Sport runflats and minimal wear on the original brake pads.  I am very happy with the OEM tires in all weather conditions and they have been great in the Wisconsin weather.So far my only three complaints or observations are:1,) Aforementioned keyless entry and hands free tailgate programming issues. 2.) The tilt steering does not go down close enough to my legs for my own personal taste, seems to stop in too high (straight) of a setting.3.) On an overcast or partially sunny day it seems like the auto fan setting wants to stay in too high of a setting and basically makes you feel cold and also creates more noise than necessary.Overall the vehicle is excellent and I enjoy my daily drive. Wow! Best Car I\\'ve Ever Owned We spent month looking at, researching, and reading about the 2017 Q7.   This car has exceeded our expectations in all categories.  Beautiful to look at, easy to drive, and comfortable for all passengers.  The Q7 is roomy enough for trips to the big box store, while feeling like a comfy sports car.  My Porsche driving husband is impressed by the handling at highway speeds and in parking lots.  The rear seats provided more than ample leg room for two 6\\'+ passengers.  I love all the creature comforts and goodies: get the Premium Plus! OMG!  The 2017 Audi Q7  Is it a dream ? The safety driving features are the best part of the Audi except the shear joy of driving it!  I have over 41,000 miles on my car in less that a year and a half and you need all of the protection you can get on the road these days!  Smooth, comfortable, great maneuverability!    You might be making a BIG mistake if you don\\'t try this one out yourself! Run Flats??? WTF did you ruin a fantastic car?? I was considering it, and it was my top choice until I found out they only come with Run Flats. After my experience with Run Flats on a Toyota, I will NEVER AGAIN own a car on Run Flats. They ride poorly, have no milage warranty, last half as long as other tires, and are EXPENSIVE to replace. Sorry Audi, I LOVE My A5 Cabrio, but will now buy someone else\\'s car just because of the Run Flats. full of tech a very nice car, perhaps a little overwhelming in the technology it offers. Drives well, smooth low speed manners, very nice handling (within the limits of a short test drive). Feels like a hell of a lot of vehicle, though I would be somewhat concerned about maintenance costs when out of warranty - there\\'s a hell of a lot of mechanical and electrical equipment in the car. Best Car I Have Ever Owned I spent a ton of time researching and comparing the Q7 with the 2016 BMW X5 and the Volvo XC90. I traded in my 2014 MDX. This thing is light years ahead of the MDX in refinement and build quality. It drives like a sports car. As quiet as a Range Rover. Car & Driver made 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a 5,000 pound suv. The dash layout is sheer perfection. Real buttons to engage functions with a quality feel. The silly Senus system in the Volvo and my antiquated MDX required at least 2 button presses of the touch screens just to get to a setting. Ridiculous. This thing is so quiet, even when in dynamic mode. I sprung for the air suspension and 4 wheel steering option. It makes a very noticeable difference. The TFT gauge cluster displays Google maps in full glory and is highly configurable to show all information. The heads up display is a huge bonus. The safety and technology features are abundant and although some are intuitive, I recommend an evening of reading the owner\\'s manual from cover to cover. The MMI system works flawlessly for navigation, maps, telephone, audio and all of the cool Audi Connect services. This new Q7 is like a spaceship. Best car I ever bought by far. Driving this car after driving the MDX and X5 is night and day. The XC90 was a nice demo, but it just wasn\\'t up to the level of performance that the Q7 has. XC-90 is a bit more luxurious with really nice front seats, but the 4 cylinder was loud when accelerating and idling was rough. In the Q7 you can\\'t even hear it when stopped. But when I get on it for a strong burst of acceleration , it sings a pretty song. Just an incredible automobile. I love this SUV! not impressed, it looks like a tall station-wagon Overall it\\'s a nice car, Drivers seat is comfortable, so as second row, however the third row is more like a jump seat for 5-8 year old. AUDI is happy to a nonce  about shaving over 350 pounds, well it comes with crappy third row NO leg room, and NO head room !? There\\'s no other option then run flat tires!? which ONLY available with one of THE WORSE in the market GoodYear tires, so you\\'ll be luck to get 18K miles on it! Road noise and handling, again - crappy GoodYear tires,  no improvement on gas mileage, DO NOT be fool of that streaker 19/25 mpg, you\\'re still getting about 16/22 mpg, and about 19 mpg in the suburbs, again it could be the GoodYear\\'s run-flat\\'s which are terrible, a specialty in the ice or snow conditions, do your self a favor and stay home. Love it We have had the car for a couple weeks - Orca Black/Black Interior/Prestige Trim. I spent quite some time with the X5, Volvo XC90, MB GLE, Acura MDX, etc. and this car hands down performed better in my opinion. The interior is stunning though the exterior is a bit tame. Although it is still very early, we haven\\'t had any problems and the service at our Audi dealership has been fantastic. This car is a replacement to a Q5 TDI we have had for a few years, also zero issues. Glitchy!!! No sooner than I pull out of dealer lot,  a warning light goes off... The next day another one, then the third day the first light goes out by itself, but I get another, then the transmission got stuck in park at school drop off line with lots of angry parents behind me, windshield wipers went to and stayed in service position, I got out and pushed them back down. They were inoperable until about the fourth time I restarted the car. That seems to be the trend, I get different warnings for things that are not an issue, low windshield washer fluid that is full, low tire pressure, etc.... It\\'s like rebooting your computer, I have found that after a series of restarts, the glitches end up clearing.....Price paid? Too much for this much headache.....The car is comfortable but after 8 days of ownership, Im not happy at all, give me my 2012 Q7 back.......anyone in the market for a lightly used Q7???  I would not buy again. Best Q7 - Audi took their time and did it right! I recently purchased new 2017 Audi Q7 Prestige.  I went with the prestige package since it includes cold weather, warm weather, 20\" wheels, and the vision packages for a better overall value.  As a previous owner of a 2013 Audi Q7 I was immediately impressed with the way the 2017 model feels in regards to handling, steering feel, and performance.  The 2017 model has shaved off 500+ lbs from the previous platform and makes the Q7 feel more like a car.  The 3 Liter engine has plenty of power (333hp), smooth shifts from the 8-spd transmission, and great road grip with little body roll.  I would describe the 2017 Q7 as nimble,  something I could never say about the previous Q7 model - which felt more like a tank.  I look forward to driving the Q7 everyday, and right now im looking for excuses to go take it out just so I can drive it.  Audi took a long time to re-design the Q7, but I think they got everything right: style, performance, comfort, and technology. Switched to Audi from BMW My wife and I have owned primarily BMW products for the last 25 years until my wife leased a VW Tiguan three years ago.  I drove it from time to time and was impressed so when it was time to replace a 2012 X5 I looked at the redesigned Q7.  The ride, handling, and performance is as good or better than the X5 and the fit and finish is far superior.  It has a little more room inside while not seeming to be larger on the outside.  The ride is a little less harsh and more quiet than the X5.  Handling install responsive and the turning radius is excellent.  It is a joy to drive.  It is also easier to fit multiple sets of golf clubs horizontally in the cargo area.  I have had the car for about a month and so far no problems.  Everything works well.  The 2017 redesign is a great improvement over the previous model.  Can\\'t say enough good things about this vehicle. Q up a Q7 Awesome Car! It is the best car I have ever owned period! Don’t spill your coffee and other issues Cup holder still located above Nav. electronics.  A minor spill will short out the system....about a $1,000 repair.  Use a real mug for all beverages.  Gas cover no longer opens from inside.  You must open the cover by pushing on it from the outside.  In cold weather the cover freezes and is extremely hard to open.  Who thought that was a good idea? Luxurious Beast This is my second Audi purchase in less than a year.  I bought a 2015 Allroad through their CPO program with the extended mileage warranty to 100K miles.  I saw the Q7 then but thought I\\'d pause and see which side of the divide my experience with this machine would fall on.  After almost a year of driving the Allroad and having it serviced ($254 for the 25K service) I saw a 2015 Q7 show up at the local dealership...6cyl supercharged and on the CPO program.  I didn\\'t hesitate...a brief negotiation and now my wife is the happiest gal on the block.  It\\'s a beast, it\\'s heavy, sticks to the road like glue - while the inside wraps you in luxurious trim, electronics and comfort.  Despite using super-unleaded gas....we got 400 miles out of the first tank full....I checked into the service fees for this beauty.  They are expensive....$800 for a minor service, brakes are $1500+, tires are low profile, and a major service is close to $2000.  With eyes wide open I opted to buy the \"service package\" from the dealer at the time of the deal.  You can negotiate...I ended up getting two years of (2 minor and 2 major services) for $1500.  You do the math.....So there are plenty of options.  In the meanwhile, this LUXURY SUV rides like a dream, accelerates like a rocket, and is a real head-turner.  With the economics in mind...if you can you should.   I should mention I\\'ve also owned a Jeep Cherokee (Overland), 2 Range Rovers, and a Tahoe.  I looked at the Mercedes and Porsche Cayanne...at the end of the day....this Audi was the best all-around bang for buck and fun combination. LOVE the car, hate the gas mileage and maintenance I got the Q7 Prestige supercharged 3.0T because I needed an 7 seater car. Love the car, fun to drive, well made, feels solid when driving. Has this weird vibration of steering  intermittently when driving on freeway from 60-80 MPH. Took it in several times, they don\\'t know what causes it. Says it is only on the Q7 model. Love all the upscale features: ambient lighting, and Love Love Love the Upgraded B and O stereo system with 19 speakers-so Awesome. I don\\'t like that I had to buy 4 new tires ($1300 after 2 years and 3 months (21,000 miles), and may need a whole new set of brakes ($1500) before the lease is up in 7 months. They are squeaking and at 6mm.  If there were less maintenance costly issues/upkeep and better gas mileage I might buy another.  I owned a RX Lexus hybrid prior to this, better gas mileage and maintenance free for years!!!! Audi Q7 Buy it, great car. Repeat issues doesn’t make a repeat buyer They particular year product was rushed out the door to make room for a new model. With that rushing there are serious issues such as brake durability, road handling, tire life, alignment and just rattles in general. All of this makes this purchase very poor. Audio and the dealership really don’t care about making is right they just want to buy time until you get out of warranty. We have had an alignment 5 times with the first 1 month after purchase. They last about 30 days max. Not totally German made!!! Currently I have 35k miles on the car and found out there was a major timing chain issue, something I didn\\'t expect on a luxury car. Fairly quiet cabin with obvious road noise from the factory tires and progressively get worse as tires wear out. Annoying rattle noise on the sunroof screen. Q7 2015 the worst the worst experience i v ever had .... i leased  a brand new Q7 2015 back in october 2015  and i have taken the car back to them 8 times!!!! barke problems ,  from the first day i picked up the car ....windows making noise , wheel bearing problems, wheel alignment and tires off balance, smart key door opener not functioning , squeaking when u apply the brakes, driver side and passenger side molding coming off, tires making very loud noise .... i have all my documents with 8 visits i had and finally the last visit they have hit my car in the service department and i have to t\\\\leave the car 1 week to get fix( bumper and rear bumper light was broken!!!! The service manager is a nice guy but he came up to me saying .. Dear Mr Zahra this is all normal and it could happen to any car u buy !!!!what!!! a brand new Q 7 2015 for the value of $60000.00 and i have to expect this to be normal?!! im sorry this is not normal at all my dear friend. im very disappointed and very shocked \\'15 S line Prestige does not come with USB ports I\\'m fairly peeved that I bought a car in 2015 that doesn\\'t have USB ports. Didn\\'t even look because every car I\\'ve been in since my \\'12 Q7 has had them, including every cheap rental. My \\'14 Audi S7 has them, as did my \\'14 Silverado. I assumed that there would have been some kind of progression of in the equipment on these cars since 2012. But seemingly, I bought the exact same car again with a slightly different options list. :-)Seems like an easy thing to work around, but they did not even provide a charger socket in the armrest,  just on top of the console, near the shifter. So if you want to charge your phone you can cram it over in the glovebox or have your charger and wiring and phone sitting on top of the console like it was 1996 all over again. It was bad design in 2007 and it\\'s comical in 2015. I\\'ll have to go to a stereo shop to get wiring run into the armrest. Just like it was 1996. :-)Enough whining about that oversight. It\\'s still the capable SUV it was in 2012. Because of the VW TDI scandal, I was unable to purchase the TDI. Which I thought was a phenomenal powertrain. So once I\\'ve driven it a while, I will review the new 3.0T more thoroughly.  I was expecting it to be sadly underpowered by comparison, but so far I\\'ve been pleased with it. Sadly the back up camera setup has not changed, and compared to my other \\'14 model cars it seems really tiny and poorly laid out. As I said before, it really seems to be the same car as before but more options have become standard. Or at least more available?  Big ones that I didn\\'t get in my \\'12 are keyless entry and start, and XM traffic info on the nav display.  Also, with the S line or prestige package, I got ventilated seats up front and heated seats in the back. The ventilated seats seem to work better than those in my \\'07 A8. They also offer a black optics package which blacks out almost everything. 2015 Audi Q7 - A pure driving pleasure Pros: Real pleasure to drive, very quiet vehicle, roomy and spacious, luxury finish and classy interior. Very pleased with the overall performance, styling and technology features. Cons: Some items are smaller than competition - MMI screen, glove compartment, sun glass holder. Navigation is a little more complicated than the rest. Front camera not part of the parking assist package. wife loves it..so that settles it Looked hi and low for a Q7 TDI Premium Plus.  Found one  and couldn\\'t be happier.  Had to take it in for a minor adjustment on the aft sunroof that rattled. Local dealer was very supportive.  Yes it might be pricey, but your getting alot for the money.  The quality of build, fit and finish is top notch.(update)several months later and i hardly get to drive it.   had to replace aft brakes.  easy do it yourself. everything on this vehicle is easy.  just do research.  transmission fluid is dextron VI.  local parts store has lifetime warranty on all parts.(update update)  wife drove my other vehicle and asked if she could have her Audi back. Took Audi on a road trip and actually got a tad bit over 700 miles on a tank of fuel.  This vehicle is a keeper to me. Ok car, but Ok at $50k doesn\\'t make the cut Where to begin with this car? The biggest problem is that the controls, for the most part, just make no sense. Let\\'s take safety - all other modern vehicles with front sensors alert you when parking. With this car, you have to enable the feature (or go into reverse first) before the system becomes active. That\\'s not just non-intuitive, but just downright dumb. As for the side assist, make a turn when a car is next to you and nothing will register.  The side assist is only blind spot assist, and there are strict parameters where this function only works.  This is junk - the truth in engineering is that you help the driver and take the risk out of driving by adding modern technology, not that you take technology and make it not work the way it should.  Other controls are not intuitive either - from AC to the pain of having to use the wheel to enter an address for navigation.  Interior looks nice, but functionality and design are fighting each other.  Lexus and Infinity vehicles have much better fit and finish to them and are intuitive and easy to use. great car great suv  but had some issue 1 time gas tank lid  did not  open  even with emergency opener did not open  glad I have enough gas to drive to dealershiproad side assistant  don\\'t send anyone to fix this minor issue Impressed I have owned 3 Audi\\'s already and never the diesel. I am actually impressed with how it takes off and how it drives; however, not so impressed that the particular model my husband bought did not have what I thought was standard features.  Setting of drive 1 and 2; and bigger tires and lastly steering wheel warmer. But overall I do like the car and the drive.  I would recommend it. Beautiful Full Featured Car - but some caution. The car drives really smooth in drive mode, but in sport mode it\\'s a little jerky from the start but thereafter is smooth and fast. I\\'ve never owned an Audi before and the 8-speed Tiptronic is very smooth, but it doesn\\'t go into a true manual transmission mode, most likely for engine safety reasons. Meaning, in manual mode, when you down shift, it won\\'t go into a lower gear unless the RPMs are at a certain level. If the RPMs are too high it won\\'t allow you go to a lower gear. So you don\\'t really have the control that you would have with a true manual transmission. For example, you are going too fast and want to down shift around a curve, it won\\'t let you unless you break and slow down first. That said, the transmission is very smooth if you know what to expect from it. I live in the mountains and the car is heavy, so it is a bit mushy on the curves but handles well. The heaviness is good in the snow and provides for a quiet ride. When the doors shut, you really feel like you are getting your money\\'s worth. Now as far as features, it is fully featured and the details make all the difference. Audi has added nice touches; such as, there are two sun visors on each side and the one visor has the option of swinging to the side while the other blocks sun from the front. Additionally, the visor that swings to the side has a sleek pullout extension that allows for additional sun blockage. Now for the cons: I have only 22k miles and have already replaced all four tires and it’s due for breaks in another 1k miles and the service assistant said that rotors usually need to be replace with each break pad change as well , so maintenance is expensive. Also, I the check oil has come on twice between oil changes even though not due. So I called the dealer and they said I needed to add a can or two to get by until the oil is due for a change and that it is normal for the car to burn oil like that.  I have also had major dashboard warning lights come on twice and had to bring the car in twice, in addition to regular maintenance, for these reasons. The first time I brought it in was for the “Audi Q7 engine emission warning light” and the “Audi Q7 glow plugs pre heating warning light.” They said, the car had been exposed to bad diesel and they ended up having to change the lower fuel pump.  Then after two months I brought it in the second time for the same warning lights. Again, the claim was bad diesel and the fuel filter and all the fuel lines had to be changed. The car is still under warrant, but the thought of have to pay for all this is scary. I’m hoping this has been worked out, but I’m skeptical since I only go to major brand fuel stations. Love my diesel Car handles great, we love the diesel power and the milage is ok especially with my heavy foot. Overall I feel like Audi lacks in the tech department compared to my old X5 and my current \\'15 GMC Sierra 2015 TDI Q7 _ review I traded in my MB 2012 GL550 for the 2015 Audi Q7 TDI.    Overall very impressed with the ride and how quite the Q7 is compared to the MB.  The Audi TDI has great performance and rides much-much smooth than the MB GL550 did.   Plenty of room in the Q7 \\'15 model for us as a family of five.  The technology is great, easy to use and functions as one would think, not a complex interface like MB icommand.  Audi technology features are well done, I have internet enabled in this Q7 and it gets a great signal, we\\'ve connect up to 5 devices, the max is 8 devices.  Of Course Bluetooth enabled works well too.   Overall I love how smooth the Q7 is, handles well and while it\\'s a V6 Diesel with 240 HP it has over 400LB of Torque per ft.  The MB GL550 was a bullet at 390HP but rode rough I thought and the technology gap with other car manufactures in the 2012 MB GL series was just not good.    The Audi Q7 gets great milage about 18-19 in the City and over 25-28  m/p/g on the HWY, much higher too is possible, but I have a heavy foot.  One could get in the 30\\'s for HWY milage easy.  Great interior.   I recently put in Adblue myself and the \"Adblue\" light went away after registering full. My Squeaky Brakes??? Since the day the car left the lot, the brakes have squeaked, made noise, annoyed me.. I took it back to the dealer and there response was “What Noise”.... I am two brake jobs and new rotors into the car and still they squeak??  I was told get up to 30-40 Mph and slam on the breaks to get the dust off of them. Huh Really.. Didn’t work. As I talk to more and more Q7 owners they all have the same bad story. For the cost of this car, they should be able to engineer brakes the don’t squeak. Perfect Q7? If performance is critical,  you really need to verify you are getting the 333hp engine.  Very confusing and I missed it.  I think that you are limited to the Prestige package.? 24,000 Trouble Free miles Highway mileage great, city not so great. Third row access is tight. Solid feel. Q7 Love! I\\'m in my third q7 and I cannot get enough. Frankly, the vehicle has no flaws...and trust me, I look for them! Best SUV you can buy  The 2013 Audi Q7 is a great SUV.It has great power, handling, and safety you can ever ask for.It has plenty of room for hauling the family around including the dog (75 lbs) to and front soccer, grocery store, and family road trips.So far i have al but positive experiences with the Q7. best Euro SUV on market Bought Q7 TDI 3.0 used in 2014 with 25k miles. Exterior styling is very Euro-slique. LED headlight design is very eye-catching and bright. Crisp ride with almost no vibration or wind noise but a little harsh. I traded out tires for Pirelli scorpions and dropped recommended psi and that has helped. Still rides less cushy than Tahoe or Yukon and especially our Escalade which we traded. The interior is scandanavian like minimalist with easy buttons but lacks a factory DVD player option and any rear factory monitors for entertainment and rear seat climate control that is worth a darn. That\\'s a fail for Volkswagen/audi in my opinion since the Tahoe, Suburban and Escalade have a movie theatre quality rear entertainment system and rear heated and colled seats now. What you get with Audi is impeccable materials. Fit and finish is exceptional. Eveything in cabin is tied down, no rattles like US SUVs. Also, they use REAL leather in seats, not \"pleather\" like US brands. That means the seats actually last and wear over time and dont crack and lose tanning like our Cadillac did. Rear luggage space with 6 people is inadequate. Third row seats only big enough for 7 year old. Cant get two pieces of luggage behind 3rd row seats. Had to buy $800 roof rack. All that said here are the pros...acceleration with turbo diesel is nasty! Once it revs up it just goes like a stabbed rat. 0-60 in close to 5.5! At 75-80 highway it sips fuel. We have seen actual Mpg of 36 and close to 550 miles between fill ups. This engine is superior to any US diesel even in the Fords! I know they may have \"fudged\" on emission reports but I have to say (california tree huggers) worth it!! We have 100k on vehicle now and maintenance has been a problem. It has developed bladder control issues like all my prior Germans and leaks oil all over garage. Dealership said they could replace gasket between engine and trans to fix for a meer $7k. I\\'ll get a drip pan...tnx. It also chews up tires like a 5th grader goes through tennis shoes. The Quattro does not allow a slip like other US AWDs and it takes 2mm of tread off every tight turn. It also consumes brakes like a teenage boy goes through food. Two complete sets of brakes (dealer will not turn rotors?!) in 3 years at $2200 a pop!!! No bueno...volkswagen needs to abandon Bosch and talk to Raybestos or Brembo.  Overall amazing engine and impeccable attention to detail with interior finish, but add 10% to sticker price for post warranty and all maintenance. Its a pricey ride.Update on Q7: the car has now crossed 120k miles. We have had more engine problems and it has been back to dealer twice. We are considering buy-back with VW/Bosch class action for the emissions fraud. We love the gas mileage with the 3.0T diesel and the interior and exterior are holding up very well with little signs of wear. But the vehicle maintenance and reliability is starting to become a problem. Unfortunately, it seems to be following the tradition of my other German autos after 100k where they start to break frequently and the out of warranty repair bills become astronomical. Seeing at least $1100 per visit or more with $120/hour labor charges. We have friends with identical vehicle and they are at the same conclusion. Disappointed with overall experience of ownership with this vehicle, hoped it would hold up better than BMWs. VW needs to work with dealers to drop labor charges and high ownership maintenance costs and build them with more reliable parts. Very pleased with my Q7 TDI Wanted to wait until after my first required service for a true evaluation of the Q7. Bought my Q7 TDI after driving/considering the X5D, ML350 Bluetec, Toureg TDI. Only the TDI provided me with the space I needed in cargo area and fairly useable 3rd row, even if only occasionally. I have my own soccer training business and none of the others would fit my gear without much struggle. Close 2nd were the ML, which rode wonderfully, and the X5D which felt very much like a BMW. The Audi is a great combo of all the things I needed. Very powerful, quiet, and tremendous gas mileage! Came from an \\'07 MDX where I struggled to get 330 miles from full tank, I now get that on a half tank! **Update 7/2016...Still love the Q7! The only thing that I would improve is the WiFi. Hope they have improved it for 2016 because mine is awful. Nine out of ten times I have to take it off WiFi if I\\'m trying to stream music because it can\\'t do it. Other than that, it\\'s been a great vehicle for us.**Update 1/2017 Cancelled the Audi Connect which provided the WiFi through Sprint. Total waste of money. Hope it\\'s improved. Had my first mechanical failure since purchase in 4/2013. Blower fan for climate control died, unfortunately during the coldest weather of winter so far. Audi Chantilly was awesome as usual and was replaced under the extended warranty I purchased. Other than that, still love the truck. Sadly disappointed the TDIs have been eliminated for the foreseeable future. Will consider trading in on a new diesel if they ever come out with one. Q7: Power and Luxury is possisble! The Q7 TDI with the 8 speed automatic is a pleasure to drive. This is not your typical diesel found in US cars. The TDI is very quiet but really strong, the torque provides a very smooth acceleration and the 8 speed transmission shifts flawlessly.On a recent highway trip to Atlanta, Ga we locked the cruise in at 78 and were getting 26.6 MPG with 3 adults. The Audi MMI ( multi media interface that controls the nav, music and voice recognition works great. I really like the Goggle Earth Navigation.The MMI allows for up to 8 devices to be connected through WiFi.The seats are comfortable and 2 position seat memory works well for the needs of 2 different sized drivers.  very nice CUV had this truck for about six months has less than 11,000 miles very fun to drive a tank this size like a sports car really drive great on the twisties, and off road - WOW i cannot believe some of the stuff i\\'ve climbed with this truck it just goes up dirt and mud road, will report back when snow finally falls in the Lake Tahoe area, igave a \"3\" for interior design cause a small spill on the MMi cost $1,100 dollars to replace, oh well no drinking in the truck. AUDI Q7 I\\'ve driven BMWs for the last 15 years but wanted a change. I looked at Audi because I liked the styling and pretty much knew it\\'d be well built.  Pros: After 25,000 miles I still love getting in and driving every day. Great power, common-sense functional, simple and effective layout. Plenty of space, easy fold down seats and awesome looks inside and out. Full time 4-wheel drive really grips the road.   The Everything SUV I love my new Audi. I wanted to upgrade from a mid-size/range SUV to something nicer that would hold more value. I love the body style not overly done and it gives me the power of a truck with the feel of a sporty SUV without all that annoying road noise. The flashy headlights won me over others. It offers uncompromising space in the back already having lugged several loads from Lowes with ease. Sure the last row seat to accommodate 7 is a little tight, but let\\'s face it, if you still have full grown adults in your backseat all day you\\'ve got bigger problems not getting your kids out the house. The leather and finishes are luxurious as well. For the lady who wants it all enter Audi Q7.  Absolutely Trust Audi Q7 TDI for Long Road Trips Best SUV, truck or car I\\'ve ever owned out of the many. Added running stainless steel boards and wind deflectors. Always serviced on time.  At age 74 comfortably drove accompanied with wife to Salem, Oregon and back from Atlanta, Georgia averaging 26.2 MPG over 8,000 miles...awesome torquewithout a maintenance mishap. Only challenge was finding correct diesel nozzle size for fill at truck stops. Not a biggie.Currently have 103,000 miles on odometer. Received loyalty card because of EPA over played hyperbole regarding clean diesel dispute. Expect new administration to put shorter leash on EPA gone wild. Used card for service. Thank you Audi. Overall my trust remains strong.Currently waiting for Audi emission settlement for 3.0 TDI. Really don\\'t want to sell it back. Q7 remains bullet proof reliable. Favorite Audi yet I\\'ve owned 2 A4s, an A6 4.2l, an allroad, and an A5.  All good/great cars, but the Q7 TDI trumps them all.  Who would have guessed a car this big could be so nimble and so much fun to drive?  We bought it for the fuel economy and third row seating, but we love it for the way it handles.  We got the S-Line package -- think it makes the exterior that much cooler.  The Q7 also has a great interior, a great navigation system (you can enter the destination using voice recognition!).  And to think we were even considering a minivan... Excellent Crossover I don\\'t usually feel compelled to review a vehicle but with the 2010 Audi Q7 I could not help myself. I traded in an 07 MBSL550 and a \\'08 Lexus RX400h and the new Q7 is like both of those cars in one. The diesel is quiet and the power is amazing. Mileage so far is 23 combined, 21 city, 29 on highway cruising from Vegas to LA at 82mph.The biggest seller for me on the Q7 is the ride quality it is smooth like a Lexus but corners flat like a sedan. NO body roll and motion sickness. I drove the new MDX, MBML and X5 35 the Audi beat them all on total all around comfort and blended performance. The X5 was to hard to steer in parking, MB was pricey with no real advantage over the Audi. Love my Q7 TDI! I have had my TDI for about a month and I LOVE it!  I consistently get about 25 mpg on my commute, a mixture of stop and go highway and side roads. It has great power and I love the panoramic sunroof with electric shade. I had a chance to use my air conditioned seats the other day and let me tell you, what a great feature!  All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. From AMG to Q7 Some thought I was crazy to go from my E55 to a Q7 but I really think it as a great choice. Mileage is 23 mpg, tdi power is plenty although a little slow the first second or two. Got the S Line w/21 inch wheels and the dynamic handling, so ride is not as soft as but the handling is great. As a long time MBenz owner (still own SL55) I think Audi is on to something. MMI is a pain compared to MB\\'s system but I am learning. TDI is a winner Just purchased the 2010 Q7 TDI a week or so ago.  Excellent build quality and impressive driving experience.  Averaged over 23mpg for 1st tankful, divided between city and interstate--- about 27mpg on interstate portion--- GREAT!!!  killer audio--mmi takes some getting used to but eventually makes sense.  Absolutely no diesel smell or lag and engine noise is negligible--- could be a game changer for US consumer acceptance od diesel.  3rd row seat for kids(or our grandkids!!) only, but the 1st two rows have plenty of room.  Love styling.  Only minor complaint is low overhead entering drivers seat.  Overall  a great vehicle---drives smaller than it is with excellent performance and mileage New 2010 TDI Q7 I have put about 1000 miles on the Q7 so far. The diesel performs very well and is relatively quiet and virtually smoke free. My combined mileage, manually calculated from my first full tank was been about 23mpg.  When you are idling or stuck in traffic, the mileage really drops off.  I drove through a heavy rain storm last evening and as expected the heavy vehicle and all wheel drive performed flawlessly.  The ride and cabin accommodations are elegant and quite comfortable.  The large panorama sunroof gives the interior a very comfortable feel. The TDI is classified as an \"Advanced Lean-Burn Vehicle\" by the IRS and is eligible for a $1150 tax credit. Info is available on the IRS website.   SUV of the Future I owned the \\'07 4.2 Q7 before this and really enjoyed the car but wasn\\'t thrilled with the lower gas mileage (18.5mpg). I tried the Q5-good mileage but too small. The TDI is terrific-am averaging over 25 mpg on hway and city; over 28mpg on hway. Upgraded MMI (easy to use); LED lights; when parking, warning sounds for front and back bumpers (plus rear camera). Ride is smooth and quiet and excellent pickup from start. Small delay in engine start when turning key. For fill up, had trouble finding diesel nozzle that fit-many are too big. The electronic stability control is a great feature that really works-slows car down when going downhill in slippery conditions. It is a pleasure to drive this car. Roomy, sporty and not a minivan We just purchased the 2010 Audi TDI S- Line with the Prestige Pkg.  It was one of the first to land here in the US.  For reference, we traded in our 2006 Mercedes ML 500 - which we loved, but had many problems.  First of all, the Diesel is absolutely great.  It has the pickup of a V8 with the fuel economy of a V4.  With 14 miles on the car, I drove it from Houston to Dallas.  I averaged 28.9 MPG.  The gauge barely moved off off \\'F\\'.  It is very roomy, drives extremely smooth, is very quiet and has conveniences that not only make it safer (i.e., side assist), but more enjoyable to drive. Also, the 3rd gen MMI is very easy to use and practical. Great car, Water leaks from de roof Expensive repairs, and parts A big lemon I want to love. Let me start out by saying that we absolutely love the look and performance of this vehicle.... when it\\'s working.   The electrical system in this car is complete junk.  We have had repeated issues with the keyless entry, keyless ignition, rear gate closure, trailer electrical (lights won\\'t work), air suspension, window switches, and now the HVAC fan motor is squeaking.   Each trip to the dealer averages $1,200-$1,500 for repairs.    Both Maplewood Audi and Audi of Minneapolis have the most lackluster service departments (they are owned by the same company, so if you\\'re in the Twin Cities you\\'re S.O.L.).I want to state again, that my wife and I love our Q7 when it\\'s working.  However, the service costs are obscene.   Also,  I have a 2014 Porsche Cayenne and I\\'m starting to have the same electrical/sensor gremlins creeping in.  The only thing that makes it tolerable is that our Cayenne is under warranty, but it still sucks to drop it off for maintenance every 5,000-10,000 miles because a sensor or system is malfunctioning.   I think we are going to avoid products from Volkswagen Group until they shape up on the electrical front. Nice ride with a price Buying an Audi you buy a very comfortable ride but wih that ride it comes with a price. Having owned a Q7 the ride quality was very nice but however it \"nickeled and dimed me\" however I wish they were just nickels instead of thousands and thousands in repair costs. Materials are very nice and easily accessible. The third row seat is tight but for kids it\\'s fine. The styling of the exterior is what I believe to be one of the best looking SUV on the market. lasting quality through the years I have had my Q7 for 10 years and have loved it since day one. This is the only car I have kept for this length of time in my life and the reason is, it never disappoints. For a family of 5 it has been a great traveling car and very comfortable and convenient for every day carpooling and regular use. No major problems popped up along the way, just the usual...squeaking breaks, break replacement a few times, tire replacement 3 times and leather cracking in the driver\\'s seat base (5 inches long) and passenger seat. Check-ups and other service visits usually end up over $500 a piece, but overall the car has been wonderful to have, reliable and very comfortable. I have loved owning an Audi so much that I may consider a smaller Audi model but I still need to evaluate if I want to pay the hefty service fees (as I have 2 kids in college at the moment), that aside I think I am going to keep this one to the end. I\\'m almost afraid to get something else because I have enjoyed owning this car so much! Disasterous Q7 experience Where do I start? 2000km off warranty, the engine blew up and cost $15k to replace and install. the brakes have been replaced a dont know how many times(last count 4). Brand new exhaust system installed at 100k kms @$3800; and now a new fuel tank to the tune of $3200 and $1200 in labour. Car has only ever been serviced at Audi dealers. This is my 5th audi in 13 years and will be my last. Audi Canada has been very difficult to deal with and unresponsive. The obviously have no idea how much it costs to create the type of brand loyalty they r losing. As I type, i am booking a test drive in the 2013 BMW 5 series sport wagon. Good by and good ridance Audi. I should have done this long ago.  Great car with unfortunate design flaws All cars have + & -; from a high end luxury SUV you expect mostly +. That\\'s the case. My problem was leaking draining tubes resulting in water in the front passenger well and in the back, invisibly in the area with the unprotected amplifier, MMI, GPS units. Result: all failed + battery drained. Cost:$3,500 (not covered by warranty). That\\'s the most disturbing part to me: this car has been maintained by Audi as recommended but I still end up with a problem I could not avoid. This is not compatible with the premium price you pay for a Q7, you expect peace of mind. Moreover it is a known problem since Audi/VW lost a class action suit on this problem. Details at LeakingAudi website and Twitter. Dream Machine The Audi Q7 with the 4.2 FSI motor is a dream to drive.  The adaptive suspension quickly adjusts to road conditions, the adaptive cruise is effective and alerts you to stopped vehicles,and the Sirius satellite radio signal is superior to other vehicles.  With the optional towing packing it effortlessly pulls my 5500 lb. tow boat and let\\'s me soak up the sun with the panoramic sunroof.  At least once a week I get asked \"who makes that\" because others aren\\'t use to seeing such an effective design.  If you pick captain chairs for row two - everyone can enjoy heated seats - and as long as the third row is not regularly used - this (heavier than a Tahoe) Q7 will sweep you off your feet. Q7 - THE #1 SUV on the market! This car has truly amazed me! I thought there is no more surprise after driving AMGs, BMW 6-series or the Escalade, even just jumping from a Cayenne Turbo to the Audi. Well there is.  No more Audi for me My 3 year lease on the Q7 is coming to an end an I will definitely not lease another one.  From the start there have been problems.  The car came without the A/C charged, the rear passenger handle fell off twice before it was finally fixed and my \"leather seat cracked in the first year.  My brakes have been squealing every time I brake for the last year and they said it was brake dust. They said to spray brake area when washed and then step on brakes hard a few times.  It doesn\\'t work.  The sound drives me crazy.  I\\'ve had the same experience as others with the tires--had to replace before 25k miles.  Overall car looks nice and is comfortable, but lots of quality problems. Jekyl and Hydemobile 18\" Bridgestone tires that came on car the loudest tires I\\'ve ever owned. They also ride like they are filled with concrete. Sunroof shattered at about 5,000 mi. Repair caused a leak that migrated to the back and damaged electronics (all Audi repairs). Radio failed at 30,000 mi along with the CD screen. Film on the windshield (interior) cannot be removed by any glass cleaner either we or Audi have tried. \"Milky\" view of the world. Fuel consumption about 17 city and 22 hwy. on premium. Car is terrible in snow and ice - poor traction under power or brakes. Q-Tastic! This car is Q-tastic!  I have owned/driven some of the nicest cars on the road today, and I believe this is one of the nicest luxury cars on the road.  We purchased the car used, and have had no issues to date.  I do worry about the cost of ownership long-term, but I believe that with a good extended warranty and a little planning, that risk is very manageable.  We purchased the V-8, and I was very worried about Fuel MPG.  It is actually better than the Volvo XC90 T6 we replaced it with.  It gets really thirsty if you jackrabbit at every stop, but a mix of City/Highway will easily yield 18mpg or better.  Audi\\'s are great because they are highline but not snobby.  You will love this car! Comfy and Quiet This is the most comfortable car we have purchased (have had Mercedes, BMW, VW and other Audis).  This car has a luxurious ride for all and a high quality interior finish that is better than BMW and Mercedes. The car feels huge when driving, especially in tight spots, this isn\\'t good or bad, it\\'s just the way it feels. The Quattro system is outstanding in wet or snowy conditions and we always feel secure in this car in bad weather. Our rattling panoramic roof was quickly adjusted at the dealer during regular maintenance and hasn\\'t rattled since. No other issues. It is a very heavy car so expect items that wear out to do just that (tires/brakes) especially if you\\'re hard on them. So Much Money, So Little Value  I bought this German beast new and with the lease up in a couple months I\\'m looking forward to it going back. This vehicle looks amazing and that\\'s where the love story ends. Brakes squeal...yes, they\\'ve been replaced...it\\'s just embarrassing. Tires cup easily-3rd set, apparently, it\\'s the engineering of the AWD. MMI issues...was in the shop 12 times before it was fixed for good. Engine sensors shot & fixed. Instrument cluster currently needs to be replaced. Thermostat went. Lurches from 1st to 2nd-explained as a safety feature. Faulty back-up sensor. Poorly attached molding. My car was in the shop for a week and after haggling for a rental, I got a ford focus---my lease $1448??? Owned for 2yr and 7mo, still love it This is a beautiful machine that still turns heads.  You can see people looking intently when they are overtaking.  This is our 3rd Audi and it is a pleasure to have. My wife drives it 50 miles a day 50/50 highway city.  It has nearly 29000 mi on it.  We have only had one hiccup, and it was with the oil pressure.  A light would come on when first started. This is a lease vehicle and we are not looking forward to the day when it goes back.  We have the option to buy but it does not really fit our life needs.  I\\'m not sure what to say about all the brake wearing problems people are having.  The Q7 weighs over 5000lbs and it has brakes that stop on a dime.  Maybe driving style helps.  Terrific SUV We have had a vastly different experience to many of the recent posts. We have had this car for nearly 2 years and have had no defects or problems.  The engine, MMI system, tires etc have all been faultless.  The car is extremely comfortable and surprisingly easy to drive given its size.  In fact, we are considering purchasing another Audi due to our satisfaction.  Perhaps we just got lucky, but this vehicle has been terrific for us. Prestigious, stylish, comfortable, and reliable. If it got 10mpg more in the city it would be perfect! Replaced Brakes & Tires @ 18K I just spent almost $2000 to replace the brakes & rotors and the tires on my Audi Q7, which is only two years old and has only 18,000 miles on it.  I called the Audi dealership, and they said I must \"drive the car hard.\"  They also said they see plenty of Q7s that need brake replacements at 18K.  I\\'m a middle aged housewife--not a teenage speed racer who slams on the brakes; I\\'m more like Driving Miss Daisy.  After reading many reviews, I have found out that many other owners have had to do the same \"routine maintenance\" during the course of their leases.  Unfortunately, the $500 maintenance package that I bought when the lease started only covers oil changes.  Luxury Jiffy Lube. Hesitation I\\'ve experienced an unnerving hesitation occurs at low speeds (ex.) parking lots or left turns when a full stop is not required. The accelerator must be pumped several times before the engine responds.  Dangerous at times so I\\'ve learned to adapt to the quirk. Audi has looked at the car twice so far and says there is no apparent problem and my experiences can\\'t be duplicated. Don\\'t find it to  be particularly nimble (unfair comparison, perhaps to my previous MDX) Very quiet and luxurious with very good visibility.   DON\\'T buy an Audi Important to note: I am a grandma and a teacher. I do not speed.  I always take my car for service promptly!  I am absolutely outraged with the quality of this car.  I only have 19,000 miles and I need a NEW ENGINE.  How ridiculous is that!  This vehicle has had many faults.  One example is that emergency brake locked on me while I was driving on the freeway, very scary.   Other defects: Window mechanism broken on both front windows -Molding coming off -headlights fogged from inside -bad brakes. BE AWARE...the blue-book price has drastically decreased FIFTY Percent.  Overall,  DON\\x92T buy an AUDI!  I wish I never did!!!   German Junk Despite meaningful price-incentive at purchase, discount can\\'t make up for poor quality and ongoing issues.  Brakes and tires needed replacing at ~25K mi in response to which dealer congratulated me for outlasting the average (most customers only get 22K out of both at best)... Reason: heavy weight.  Quickly upgraded tires (they were pathetic in snow/ice - seems insane for an AWD SUV) but had to stick with same (lousy) brakes due to some proprietary sensors (anyone test this theory?).  Sunroof rattles, steering wheel vibrates at 70 mph, 2nd row seat rattles like a 15-year old Chevy pick-up.  Dealer happy to keep trying to fix but sick of driving A4 loaners. Very Disappointed Very nice looking car but brakes have been squealing since the day I bought it. Resurfaced twice. At 15K service told me I needed new brakes at the cost of $2k. Said they changed the warranty on brakes to 12K miles and I see why now. Neither Audi nor dealership were helpful just basically said \"sorry\". From what I understand there have been many brake problems in this vehicle. Brakes still squeal. Terrible customer service from Audi headquarters and dealership and obviously do not stand behind their vehicles. It is a fun car to drive but for the  money I spent you would expect high quality and customer service. Fuel economy bad even for an SUV. DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE. A Little Disappointed This is my 3rd Audi.  I have owned an A4 and currently still own an A6.  I am disappointed in the reliability and quality of the Q7.  I have only 28,000 miles on this car and brakes are already going.  The tires also need to be replaced.  I have never owned a vehicle where the brakes and tires went bad at such low mileage.  The engine sounds like it is struggling all of the time and is sounding more and more like a pick-up truck and not an Audi SUV.  We spent the extra money for the keyless start and it doesn\\'t work when it is cold out.  I think the quality of Audi\\'s have definitely decreased. Not up to Audi standards Our 3rd Audi. This one is just not up to what we had expected. Example - the gas door feels and works like a Yugo. Instrument panel is directly under cup holders and any spills screw up the audio. $800 to fix and not covered by warranty. Service has declined dramatically over the years. It feels like they are trying to wring every dime they can from us at every chance. Not much different than most but different than our past experience. Have had for 1.5 years and seems like there is always some little thing wrong. Engine is great, great on snow. If I had it to do over again I would get the GL 450 or 550. The Acura is more reliable but does not drive as well or turn as sharply.  Did I make a mistake? The Q is my 3rd Audi.  The car has good performance and room inside.  As my wife says, \"this thing can turn on a dime and give you change.\"  It does have a great turning radius for this size of car.  Mileage stinks (gets about 14/gal).  Great handling on snow/ice in the mountains of Colorado.   Had to replace all brakes & rotors at 18k miles at the tune of $1200.  Dealer said this was a common problem on this car.  No warranty coverage.  Just take it out of the pocket.  This should really be a recall issue but I\\'m sure Audi won\\'t step up to the problem. This will be my last Audi I traded in a lemon 2002 A6 in for the Q7. Within 2 months of the Q7 purchase, the windshield wipers collided during a bad rainstorm on the highway. After 5000 miles the power lift gate stopped working and the back seat wouldn\\'t lock into place. After 19000 miles, the tires needed to be replaced for $1200.  Then at 28000 miles the brake warning light came on, $1700 to replace the brakes and rotors. There was a leak in the sunroof and mold started to grow on the drivers side carpet. Great looking cars, very poor reliability and very expensive to keep up. From now on, I\\'m spending a little more for another BMW. There is a reason you see many more older BMWs than older Audis on the road. Good Engineering, Poor Customer Service I enjoy driving the Q7 and it is a well built basic SUV. Unfortunately for $60K price tag Audi falls short on customer service and attention to detail. I had serious electrical problems the 1st week I drove out of dealership and the dealer\\'s reaction was \"so what\".  They fixed it but it was as if it was expected.  Next the battery died several times and had to be jumpstarted.  After bringing it in 3 times Audi finally figured out the Software had a glitch. The MMI system(electronic brain) is unsealed and located below the tilted forward cup holders- so if you spill even a little liquid on the shifter the MMI shorts out and it costs $1000 to fix. Audi said not their design flaw my fault.  Wish I would\\'ve done my homework Like many of you I fell in love with the Q7. I\\'ve had it a year here\\'s my issues: electrical system went out (brains of the car), fuel gage failed, 3 tire flat tires within 1 year. Also had the same problem as someone earlier as a very small amount of liquid spilled next to the drink cups. It shorted my system to the tune of $1,000. Love the car and hate the car at the same time. I think I leased a lemon! Well, I really felt the need to read everyone else\\'s reviews after bringing my car in to be serviced too many times! I got it brand new fresh from Germany, and love the way it looks & the way it rides, and of course all the bells & whistles but too many problems have occured! It started with the tire pressure light appearing on all the time, which took many 1 hour trips to be serviced only at Audi. Then, the fuel pump went out, took a few days to repair- parts only come from Germany you know- then a faulty back sunroof that let water in which caused me to drive a Grand Prix for a week...are you kidding me? I paid $65,000 to drive a Grand Prix? Needed new tires already, squeeking brakes, A Piece of Junk! Bought the top of the line model fully loaded and a year later it has proven to be a piece of junk!  Brakes squealing since 5k and Audi is telling us \"it is normal and acceptable - just due to the design\".  Even gave us a fancy printed brochure justifying the squealing!  Motor in rear wiper already needed replacement, recall on trunk software, and MMI mysteriously stops working from time to time. Told we will need to replace tires \"soon\" despite only having 15.8k mi on car and have only owned it one year. Audi has produced a fine looking car but the quality stops there! Do not buy one! Let down Finally plunked down the cash for a German driving machine. Great handling, solid engine, but what a disappointment on the rest. From a jerky transmission (no trouble found of course)and creaky transmission to a $1200 MMI console from 2 drops of water and a door handle that fell off (these last two I hear happen all the time). Finish is falling off the console, cargo net fell off twice, gas door sticks open. I expect far better for this price car. Who is giving this all those 9.5\\'s? Are their cars still in the dealer lot, or did I get a lemon?  What a beauty! I bought my Q7 brand new and it is my favorite auto I have ever owned.  It is responsive in S when you want to feel speed, it has the perfect size inside and out (not too big and not too small). I love the 4 captain chairs and third row just in case we need them. As a new mom, I love the automatic tailgate and smart key: each door unlocking when near without pulling out the key. The best of all is its sexy lines. It doesn\\'t get better than this! Silence is Golden ? My Audi Q7 has been the nicest drive for handling, comfort and acceleration! but the electronics have failed since about 3 weeks after I brought it home. When it doesn\\'t work, it doesn\\'t work... no GPS, phone,radio, CD, iPod, nothing. And this was at the same time the steering column got stuck in the down position. While setting my preferred settings I lowered it, it stayed there for a month or so, the service dept fixed it but the rest is a on going mystery! Love the car... few issues I absolutely love my Q7. I will warn you though of a major design flaw. If any of you ever drink a liquid while driving, beware. I spilled the smallest amount of coffee and it shorted out part of my electrical system.This little spill will cost you close to $1000.  If you notice, the buttons are directly in front of the cupholders. What was Audi thinking? Now when I have my coffee or water, I put a cloth over the control panel!  Acura Upgrade After buying a Acura MDX a year ago I traded it for a Q7. Huge upgrade! And basically the same price, no comparison. This was the buying decision I should have made but at the time I was a new SUV driver and the Q7 seemed like a lot of vehicle for me then. I love the Q7, from the interior and exterior foot lights to the powerful but smooth styling. Build quality is exceptional, superb braking and transmission makes for a very safe and smooth ride. Audi Q7 SUV Vehicle I love to drive my Audi Q7. It handles like a dream on the highway. The Quattro AWD is the best I have driven for the size of vehicle the handling is nimble. Love it I love the SUV.  Audi has done it again. The car is a pleasure to drive.  The only problem I had is the air compressor was defective and I could not fill my tire with air when I needed to. Great SUV I have two children ages 4 and 11 months. There is enough room for one car seat, a booster seat and still room for an adult on the same row! I owned a minivan before, and although there is a little less room in the Q7 it\\'s not by much. Love the way it drives. MMI is really easy to work. The only bad thing is it gets bad gas mileage. But, you have to remember it is an SUV. Excellent for some people I\\'ve been driving mine for about 6 months now and I do love it.  It\\'s a lot like driving a loaded A6 (my Q7 is a 4.2 premium).  It handles well, accelerates well and is extremely comfortable to drive.  The tech bells and whistles offer everything you could need and want.  My only complaint with the car is the off-road abilities.  Thule doesn\\'t make racks for it and for anyone who is an outdoor enthusiant looking for a more rugged vehicle worthy of hauling bikes, kayaks, etc, you may find yourself a little disappointed.  However, some research early on may prove that this is the perfect all around vehicle for you.  My wife has a Lexus and i\\'ve gone through Land Rovers, BMW X5, Tahoe, etc. First, but not last Audi The Audi Q7 3.6 Premium is a beautiful car.  I get many people peeking through the windows trying to see the wonderful interior.  I also get many compliments on how it looks everytime I go gas it or go to school.  I got the Q7 after I traded in my Navigator.  I hated how the Navigator drove and looked compared to Q7.  The Q7 makes other SUVs look like boxes on wheels.  The Q7 drives very easy in tight spaces making it feel smaller than it really is.  People may think that the MMI will be hard to operate, but it\\'s not.  All the rows have comfortable seats, but the third row is hard to get to.  The ride is much smoother than the Navigator and goes over rough surfaces very nicely. Nice car! Purchased 3.6 premium. I love this car! Handles and performs like a sports sedan even though this is a big SUV. Fun to drive! Best SUV on the Planet!! This is by far the best SUV on the planet, save perhaps the VW Toureg which is made at the same factory as the Q7.  The Q7 is much larger than the Toureg.  The quality and ride are just outstanding and in line with the Audi reliability for building world class vehicles. The interior fit and finish are first class, and if you fold down the third row you have incredible storage space.  Of course if you fold down the second row also, the storage space is huge.  As far as safety goes, the Q7 comes with all the state-of-the-art safety features.  This is in line with the safety committments from both Volkswagen and Audi, both of whom are always in the forefront of automotive safety.   Truly an Audi Got a rare S-Line version with factory 21\" wheels that are polished on the face and painted grey on the inside. Car looks very menacing all in lava grey. Handles very well, although not quite as quick as our dearly departed Audi allroad 2.7T. But torque is phenomenal. S-Line 3-point steering wheel mounted shift paddles allow for even smoother gear changes than those possible on my DSG equipped Audi TT 3.2Q. My dream SUV I think this is the most well built and value packed SUV on the market today. I\\'ve looked at many others such as the ML500, X5 4.6, Range Rover Sport and GL450 - none of them compared in my opinion. Don\\'t get me wrong, they all have their strengths, but overall I felt the Audi Q7 was the best fit. For the money what you get in the Q7 is an exceptional value. I have enjoyed the drive and find it hard not to drive. I also have a Lincoln Navigator and an Audi A8L - the A8L used to be on the top of my list to drive but this Q7 edges it out ever so slightly. The Navigator was nice but it lacks that European road feel. Well satisfied Had a steering column bind, would not adjust. Audi replaced column, works fine now. Mileage is better than I expected, 19.4. Find the cup holders some what clumsy to use. The Bluetooth is great. Had a 2005 Touareg that had front sensors and memory exit seat, miss both of those. Overall well satisfied. Most solid Audi yet Great build quality, this is a really solid vehicle from the heavy feel of the doors to the look and feel of the interior. This is my 4th Audi in a row but first SUV so I really looked at all the options. I think the Audi offers more class, refinement, and style than the rest of the crowd without any serious flaws. If you are not a snob but insist on German engineering and styling, the Q7 comes highly recommended. One of the best Audis yet My family has owned Audis ever since I can remember. There has always been at least one in the family when I was growing up. The second car was an assortment over the years and the Audis always outperformed them. I had to get the Q7 after trading in my A6. Acceleration and fuel economy is pretty good considering the vehicle\\'s size and weight. The interior is impeccable. Everything fits together and the materials are high quality. The three panel sunroof is a definite plus, and even though it is tight, the third row can be handy. Dont use it on a regular basis, but when I\\'m in a pinch, it works out fine. With the third row folded, the trunk is extremely spacious; the power liftgate helps a lot. Best buy luxury SUV I was previously driving a Mercedes R-350 before the Q7 was out, and when it came out I knew I had to drive it on looks alone.  I\\'m a 27 year old father and when I had to drive the R-350, I didn\\'t enjoy it, because it looked like a minivan and it wasn\\'t fun to drive.  The Q7 was so much more masculine looking, it drove better, sat more people and most of all it wasn\\'t a minivan. Outstanding vehicle... hands down I am thrilled with this car.  Fun to drive, comfortable for 6 adults, able to tow 6500 lbs., and unique among a sea of lookalikes.  The 3.6 performs very well with an assertive growl and silky smooth acceleration.  Punch it and it will GO! Q7 review I\\'ve had Audis for years  and have always felt secure driving them. I live in a four season climate and have driven in snow and ice storms. This Audi feels very strong to drive and very safe. The \"Quattro\" system is the best four wheel drive system of any make of automobile in my opinion. Another Great Audi I\\'ve been driving an A6 for seven years and wanted to upgrade to an A8, but the price point was more than I wanted to spend, so the Q7 was a great alternative - A8 size and comfort with the A6 price tag.  It is very luxurious inside and out and the 4.2 V8 accelerates nicely, though not as quickly as my A6 2.7T. The 3rd row seat is not for anyone over 5\\'3\", but I only plan to use it sparingly and it folds down easily to provide ample storage.  My golf clubs can fit sideways (unlike in the A6 or A8).  One complaint is the ride is a little stiff and I can feel the bigger bumps in the road.  I have 20\" wheels, but didn\\'t opt for the adaptive air suspension (darn).   Fun SUV I\\'ve own many different SUVs over the past 12 years from two Fords (Exp), Subaru (B9), Jeeps and even my wife\\'s KIA which was a mistake. The Q7 3.6 premium is fun to drive, responsive but still a SUV (weight). I drove the BMW, Mercedes, and Volvo before I decided on the Q7. The Q7 handles like a heavy sport car as you fill the road a little too much with the 20 inch wheels. The fit and finish is exceptional. A great buy and really fun to drive. Watch your speed, as you may not notice how fast you are going. Options can make the car a little pricey. But you pay for what you get.   What a special vehicle My first Audi and I must say I am very impressed.  Now considering adding an S6 or maybe the new S5 to my stable.  Driving this 4.2 S-Line makes me feel like a very lucky guy. Seriously Bad Third row! What third row, you mean you can actually get in it. A child could wiggle in. When the 3rd row is up that it, no space left. For the length of this car, where has all the space gone. As for auto trunk lid. I broke it within 10 minutes. Seriously. Yes I know I should have read all the instructions but I don\\'t expect guests and friends to have read the manual to properly operate the auto trunk lid. This is a huge car with all the space used by the front half while we were buying it for the rear half. Our mistake, please don\\'t make the same one. Amazing I have owned about 26 cars in my life and several Audis, but this is by far the most complete package, fun to drive, comfortable, well made, vehicle I ever owned. It is a true pleasure to drive, and it is beautiful, inside and out. Everything is well thought as always on Audis. This the best SUV in this class hands down. Superb vehicle - remarkable in every way I replaced my 6th GMC Yukon/Denali with this S-Line Q7 and could not be happier.  The Q7\\'s build quality is absolutely outstanding and the features are awesome.  Vehicle is rock solid on freeway and handles like a much smaller and lighter vehicle.  Exhaust note is really fun.   My other car (for summer) is a BMW 645 CiC.  I\\'m averaging 15 mpg over 4,000 miles.  I can just begin to feel the engine opening up.   Excellent ride Just leased an Audi Q7 4.2.  Added dvd nav, sunroof, technology pkg etc.  The Q7 is not only a fun drive but secondly also extremely useful in hauling people and stuff comfortably.  No problem in terms of accelerating up hills or moving getting around slower vehicles.  Interior is one of the finest I have been in with everything laid out nicely and easily reached.   The MMI takes a little bit of getting use to but now I have no problems.  Fuel mileage isnt great (13 mpg so far) but I doubt anyonewho  bought this vehicle is worried about the cost of filling the tank. Good Vehicle Nothing really to gripe about.  Excellent ride, real tight, no rattles.  Plenty power and torque.  All the bells and whistles.  I like it.  The styling is growing on me. Fun to drive, great car for a family! I am amazed at how well car seats fit in the 2nd and 3rd row! This car has been great for my family. The day after we purchased this car it snowed a lot. This SUV handles better in the snow than our other 2 cars, being a Toyota Tundra limited 4x4 and a Jeep Grand Cherokee limited alltime 4wheel drive.  The seats are comfortable with different adjustable heat levels. Perfect for a family where one person is hot and the other cold, we each have our own temp. controls! An amazing car! Lots of room and it looks nice too! My only complaint is having a cell phone charger plugged in is slightly awkward. It drives like a car and suv combined. I am so impressed! allroads lead to Q7s I had a loaded 2.7 twin turbo allroad for four years.  I started tracking the Pike\\'s Peak concept with great anticipation.  I ordered my 4.2 Premium S-line with all the options.  Loved the allroad, but the Q7 tops it on all accounts.  Exhaust note is powerful when revving it up, yet quiet when featherfooting it.  MMI is not as difficult as people think it is.  The voice driven system works great and is very accurate.  The adaptive suspension goes from low and sporty up to tall and beefy.  The sound system is impressive and easily fine tuned.  Gotta love a sun roof.  Especially one that is over 5 feet long and 39 inches wide.  When the motorized screen retracts oohs and aahs are common Impractical 3rd row When you are spending in the range of $55,000 to $65,000 you deserve comfort. I am quite disappointed with the 3rd row. First the 2nd row glide rail is not flush mounted, 2nd getting in to 3rd row is nearly impossible since seat does not retract fully, 3rd there is no room for even feet between two rows. Also no DVD player option. Q7 - Is it what people say? I have been reading what other people are writing about the Q7 so I thought I would take the time to write one as well. Performance: happens to be really good, it\\x92s a fast car and it sits on the road well. Comfort: I have to say that it has been giving me a really bumpy ride. This weekend I had people in my car and we took a long trip together, and they all complained that it shook them up. Interior design/exterior design: In overall it\\x92s done really well, except for the fact that in the backseat you can\\x92t seat any adults, and when you do put down the seats you get very little room for cargo compared to other SUVs . Uncompromising and commanding. I have had my Q for about two weeks. I traded an FX45 for it, which I loved. I wanted something larger, but sexy, alluring, but professional. Audi really did it. I am not saying I am not going to do a few mods (larger tires and rims is all), but it really is a beauty all on its own. I looked at the MDX, VW, another FX, Range Rover Sport, BMW, and Mercedes. I have never felt so much safer and hotter at the same time. A lot of room for my single self and traveling companions. Would make a nice soccer mom look FABULOUS. All the other mommies will be jealous. There is so much room.  New SUV is Welcome Addition After 6 years driving a Lincoln Navigator, the Q7 was a wonderful change. It handles like a sports car; seats are very comfortable; engine and ride are extremely quiet and smooth; luxury features such as MMI, bluetooth, rear camera, air suspension system, large sunroof and sunscreen, and rear hatch are very useful; and the electronic stability system really works - I felt very safe descending a steep, winding, icy road without having to use the brakes. While the purchase price is high, I feel it is worth it. I actually look for reasons to drive this car. My gas mileage is a bit better than estimated: 21.5/highway, 16 city. I have received many compliments on this car. What a grand surprise I always expect great cars from Audi. But this was the best surprise. It is a fantastic ride. The comfort, handling and power (from a 6 cyl) is outstanding. This is the best vehicle in its class.  A FANTASTIC SUV I have had my Q7 for about a month now and I love driving this SUV. I got the showroom model so it comes with 20\" wheels and alloy rims. The A/C controls are a bit difficult to figure out at first, but once you get the hang of it you will find its usefulness. We have rear climate control, the Bose sound system, power tailgate, Bluetooth, 3rd row seating, and of course the MMI (navi) among few of the features. Worth the wait We ordered our S-line Q7 in August... well worth the wait! The driving experience is everything we expected and more. The motor sounds authoritative and has plenty of power. Seating is comfortable with plenty of head room for the tall ones. Third row seat is designated for small passengers on short trips. Once we became familiar with the MMI and other options they were very user friendly and worth the time to learn. We live in a warm climate and had solar tint installed on the sunroof which helps with reflective heat. Learned the battery is under the drivers seat and will need to take to dealer to get battery replaced. Why? (Bummer). Overall great ride and meets our expectations on all fronts. Best SUV I have driven I bought many SUVs.  The Q7 is the best SUV I have driven so far.  Great to drive, so comfortable.  It is a hybrid of a luxury sedan and an SUV.  Even my kids love the comfort of the back seats.  Great choice for a family. 2000 Miles and Loving it Waited two months for it to arrive but it was worth every minute.  I agree with most of the other reviews here.  The handling is what I am most impressed with.  Just does not FEEL like I am driving a large SUV.  Steering is precise around residential streets and around the clover leafs at speed.  Took my parents out last night.  My Mom kept saying \"this is so nice!!\"  My Dad kept saying \"I can\\'t get over how smooth the acceleration feels\".  They are both long term Suburban/Yukon owners.   Highway mileage about 21.  City about 14.  Not great but I knew what I was getting.  After a month and a half and 2000 miles of driving, I have yet to see another one on the road.  I just love that!!! Great Luxury Family SUV The Q7 has met my hyped up expectations. It\\'s a solid ride with  premium features you expect from Audi. It has a very thoughtful design, down to the \"coming and going\" external and internal lighting features. It\\'s also easy to see the road in the Q7 unlike some other large SUVs. LOVE This SUV! So far I am REALLY happy. This car/SUV is fun and sporty but drives like a luxury sedan. The engine growls but not too loud. I drove the 4.2 (not much more money than a loaded 3.6) and felt the 3.6 was faster, not sure why ,maybe less weight? Better gas mileage too. I also drove the S-line it felt a bit doggie, maybe the suspension or tires? I love the look and feel of the interior and all the bells and whistles especially the keyless entry no more digging in my purse! The MMI takes some getting use to but well worth the time. The only thing I did not like (at first) was the berber carpet so I ordered the all weather mats this made the car look great, now I like the durable berber!  Great SUV I got my Q7 3 weeks ago. I used to have BMW X5 and I just could not wait for the next generation due to time restrictions that I had. Q7 is much roomier than X5. Since I have all optional packages, I love to play around. It doesn\\'t ride like SUV but It does not like X5 as well. I am not sure how it will be in snow conditions but I am expecting much better than X5 since Audi has 60/40 split where X5 was more 20/80 split on all wheel drive. So far everything is looking good. Yes it\\'s good looking but not reliable   All I can say that the car looks good inside and out. But unfortunately I had the car less than two weeks and 500 miles, car check engine light came on and the car started to choke and transmission started to stall and oil light came on and its been in the shop for 5 days already and the good part is that they don\\x92t have a clue what is going on with the car.  Great car Perfect handling, - feels like a sports car. 0-60 in just 7s.  Car itself doesn\\'t feel like a big car. First when I saw it I thought, - oh my God it is too big, but after test drive I fell in love with it.  I was pleasently surprised This is one of the best SUVs I have ever driven. During my first test drive I didn\\'t know what to expect but I was shocked. Very comfortable, great handling, nice power (V8) and full of features. You will not be disappointed. **It is just an awesome vehicle** Had to wait 4 months to get this because of the 6 seat configuration and the mfg of the 3.6s but it was well worth the wait.  After owning 2 large SUVs (AWD Escalade & 4WD Navigator) neither one can hold a candle to this vehicle. This vehicle handles more like a sports car but on a much larger scale.  It will get up and go and the brakes will bring you down in a hurry not to mention a super smooth ride.  Adaptive air suspension really makes a difference as well. The interior is very sporty but also luxurious.  The premium leather is definite quality.  There is nothing about this vehicle that is not first class and I am more than happy with my purchase.  The only downfall was the wait time. Great Car For Family I never thought to own an SUV unitl we had a child and we test drove this car.  Wow, it feels a lot like my BMW sedan yet has room like an SUV. It\\'s excellent Just got a fully loaded Q7.  Drives very smoothly. Engine sounds great in sports mode.  Super comfortable and beautiful interior. If you\\'re into technology - the MMI is great. A great choice Got the Q7 about 3 months ago, and love it since. Before I was driving the FX35, which was a bit quicker but you can\\'t really compare the quality and features that come with the Audi. As a surfer, I manage to fit a 9\\'6 longboard inside the car together with my wife and two kids! A great buy with cool looks. One week into my 3.6 Premium ownership Well, so far the Q7 has met my expectations. The handling is smooth, precise and powerful. Found out that my Q7 has no air conditioner for the two seats in the very back when my two nephews sat there last weekend. Bummer. On our trip to Santa Barbara on Saturday the temperature was well over 90 and the sunshade covering the panorama sun roof was doing little to keep the sun and heat out. My head was baking. Why not a solid sun roof cover to keep the sun and heat out? Went to a window tinting place in Van Nuys, CA to have the entire sunroof and the little sun roof at the very back tinted with a new film that has ceramic in it. Cuts the heat but not dark. Seems effective so far.  New SUV is worth the wait! Handles like a sports car, or at least better than my previous Infiniti FX, and the FX is SMALLER.  Brakes are powerful. Luxury features are everywhere. Engine sounds sweet and it\\'s powerful. MMI system is very logical and easy to use.  I can\\'t wait to take it skiing! Smooth and Refined I bought my Audi Q7 to replace my Honda Pilot. I needed the extra towing capacity and I wanted a luxury SUV. The Audi Q7 did not disappoint me. The inside is typical Audi, comfortable, quite and well thoughout. The controls are all first rate and the car\\'s performance and handling are top notch. The mileage is averaging about 16.3 mpg in mixed driving. If you select the sport mode on the transmission, it makes a huge performance difference, but it does hurt your mileage.  All in all probably the best SUV on the market today. No funner 7- seat  SUV  out there! I just got the car a few days ago and it was worth the wait! Having three kids and looking for a luxury and sporty SUV with room for friends is challenging. Audi did it! Not only is the handling fantastic but with the air suspension upgrade, the ride is so smooth. The features for the driver and the passngers are fabulous.  Although the third row is too small for an adult, its perfect for kids.  Having the sun roof in the rear doesn\\'t make you feel confined as in other 3rd row mid size SUVs.  Audi\\'s greatest sedan is an SUV I am not an SUV guy,  I was looking at an A6 or even an A8.  This was responsive and more fun to drive.  I made my commute less stressful.  I  do have some guilt about the mileage after driving an A4,  but the visibility sitting up higher made up for that, and the handling kept has all you expect in German Sportiness Audi got it right Simply perfect.  However I can\\'t imagine this beast with anything less than a 8 cyl.  The mid range torque is a blast in the passing lane. Great road trip vehicle. I road tripped the vehicle from Naples to New Smyrna Beach (250 miles each way) the day after I bought it.  It was far and away the best driving SUV I\\'ve driven to date and I\\'d dare say it was just about comparable to my 7 series.  I only wish it had keyless start/entry. The SUV to DRIVE!! The Audi Q7 4.2 is a drivers car.  It feels just like an Audi sedan.  The power is impressive as well as the fit and finish.  Don\\'t expect too much in the way of mileage, but with an SUV what do you expect. The car is heavy but feels really light and nimble.  It\\'s exceeded all my expectations.    The best SUV- $60K can buy Quattro-the most trustable all wheel drive system 350 hp with 325 torque gives an amazing performance. Most important, driving this big SUV feels like driving a sedan, not a truck at all. I love the interior, fit and finish, high quality materials with real wood and stainless steel and the exterior design is bold and elegant. I don\\'t think there is anything better out there. Do not buy this car! It is bad when you are at the dealer service center and the salesman as well as the senior tech both tell you that they wouldn\\'t own this version of the car! So my wife and I were looking to swap out our 2012 Lincoln MKX for another luxury vehicle with 3rd row seating to cover the new needs of our expanded family. We had owned the Lincoln for 3 years and aside from repairing a faulty cooling fan, the vehicle performed flawlessly. We drove it on many vacations and loved the ride comfort, features, and style. The only fault at all was the lack of seating which is what led us to search for something new. We thought we had found that in a used red 2008 Audi Q7. We choose this vehicle because we were looking to buy another SUV within the price range that we could sell the used MKX ($15-16k). The Audi won us over with the amount of features, luxury items, sportiness and pedigree being a cousin of Porsche and Volkswagen. The vehicle we purchased had comparable miles as our MKX had (75,000 ish) so we expected a vehicle that would be broken in with a few scratches here and there and maybe some slight wear on the interior. What we received however was something straight out of a comedy. We ordered the vehicle and had it shipped to our house. When the transport arrived the vehicle didn\\'t want to start so they had to boost it to get it off the trailer. While at idle we began to smell gas. Upon inspection we found the fuel tank was pouring gas onto our drive! Went to move the car but it wouldn\\'t start back.We had it towed to the Audi dearlership for repair ($210.00). 3 days later we picked it up after a service recall which repaired the leak free however the leak caused damage to the fuel pump which required replacement ($475.00) and to replace the battery it had to be programmed to the vehicle ($318.00).On the way back home however, the TPMS indicator came on then the ‘Hill Climb Assist Error’ indicator, then the ABS light and then the Brake booster light. Not far after the check engine light came on and the vehicle began to misfire. Additionally, as I was travelling back home the cabin began to get stuffy. I went to turn up the AC and both blowers were not functioning. I opened up the sunroofs and dropped the windows. Turned the stereo on to popping and cracking speakers. Not to be outdone, the charging port that I was using to charge my phone stopped working. As misery sat in on my 65+ mile trek home, it began to rain. I went to roll up the windows and close the sunroofs to find that the rear window wouldn’t go back up and the front sunroof only partially closed and the rear would not shut either. So the final 15 minutes of the drive home was spent getting rained on. After we arrived home my wife helped me force the rear window up and we managed to coax the main moonroof closed however in the process the rear plastic cover of the passenger seat fell off! Additionally, we opened up the rear hatch to gain better access to the rear sunroof but when we went to shut it, the hatch wouldn’t close. It took 10 minutes of coaxing it to finally get it all the way down. The next day we contacted the dealership and told them what had happened. They suggested that it could have been affected by the battery programming (I called BS on this but went along with it) and suggested we bring it back in for a diagnostics test to see. We drove the vehicle back, in the heat, without ac and only able to drive it 55 mph on the highway due to the engine misfire. The dealership to notified us that the AC blower motors were in fact faulty, the speakers were blown and the fiber optics were busted on the stereo (thus disabling the satellite radio and causing a short). The tire pressure monitors were all dead (they run on batteries which expire every 5 years or so and require replacement, even on the spare, to the tune of $275.00 each), the rear window resistor was bad, the sunroofs and hatch control assemblies were faulty , all but one of the charging port connectors were melted at their base and shorted (also something that is prone to failure as we were informed.) The engine misfire was caused by a faulty connection to one of the coils which was easily corrected during the diagnostic test. Overall, however the test alone cost us $330.00. Then the dealership told us the cost for the remaining repairs would total $4,385.00! We ended up getting our $14k back from the purchase and now own a Cadillac Escalade. Will never own an Audi due to the cost of repairs and the volume of items which are prone to fail with age! Great vehicle One of the best vehicles that I ever owned Best vehicle I\\'ve owned! I\\'ve owned 3 Japanese cars, 2 Americans, and this SUV by far is the best vehicle I\\'ve driven. It is so enjoyable and comfortable. Besides the fact that it drinks more gas than my dad drink his beers in a week, the Q7 is a fantastic vehicle. Just one thing, WHY THE HELL AUDI DOESN\\'T HAVE A REGULAR AUX PORT LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD? I have to open the iPod box every time and it\\'s just not very convenient. Other than that, I have no complaint about this beautiful SUV. 125,000 miles and still ticking. The cupholders are placed in a terrible location, making spills into the navigation controls inevitable, as they are located just below the cupholders.  Even a minor spill into the system causes it to short out.  I have already replaced two and it looks like I have another problem.  The electronics should be better insulated to allow for occasional spills.  Better yet, move the cupholders to a less vulnerable location.For the second time, I am experiencing rips in the leather seating.  I have never had this problem with other cars, including my 15-year old Beetle with leather seats.  And no, I don\\'t carry knives or screwdrivers in my back pockets.  Just had to replace the battery, which is located under the passenger side front seat, which needs to be removed to get to the battery compartment.  Ridiculously expensive for labor.  Audi wanted around $600 for replacement.  Had it done at my local foreign car repair shop for $380.  Replacing brakes is incredibly expensive, even when done at my repair shop. Disappointed I purchased my Q7 October 2008 & loved it for the first 2 years.October 2010 things started to go wrong. I drive a lot of highway miles so it was out of warranty.The lane side assist went out, the latch for the rear moonroof broke ($900.00 for a latch!) & in November 2010 the heat went out, only on the drivers side, then both motors on the mirros went out at a cost of over $300.00 each.It is now January 2012 & I am still dealing with heat issues after spending $1500.00 in repairs it still doesn\\'t work properly, sometimesnot at all.Now my remote is beginning to fail.I have spent the last 15 months dealing with failures & expenses.I\\'m done! Will never buy Audi again! Noisy engine The reliability has been poor, the worst of any vehicle a have owned. Had to tow it to the dealer in my first week of ownership, the engine just stopped running. Front bearing gone at 25,000 KM. Driver door keeps dropping, it has been fixed 3 times. Other problems, way too many. Frustrating. I find the V6 quite noise even below 2000 RPM; makes more  noise than my brother in law Ford Escape. Dealer service could be better Tonka toy with a great ride To  be honest we have not had big problems just lots of little ones. The gas cap cover is pathetic and the lock is a joke - open it with your fingers when locked. With kids and pets it seems impossible to not knock water etc over in the center console which ruins the electronics. Part of the body is simply falling off. This is our 4th audi and we have not looked anywhere else simply because of the way we were treated. This too has declined - still pretty good just less than their usual stellar. In 2 years the seat leather has developed a large long crack in it - our 10 year old a6 is still fine. So Far So Good Good car so far. Lots of comments on the great looks. No major issues to date. Ready for new tires at 27K. Brakes are coming. Pull a 5000lb boat with some difficulty. Pulls well up to about 50mph then struggles trying to maintain 60mph+, even on the slightest hill. I manually shift to keep the gearing correct or the engine just rev\\'s really high. Recommend the 3.0 TDI or the 4.2 V8 if you plan to pull more than 3000lbs.  My biggest beef is the lack of a rear hatch close feature on the key fob.  Audi seems to think your hands are full when loading, but not full when unloading.  Can\\'t reach the button with full hands. Wife wants another when the lease is up. Probably the TDI Prestige.  Q7 4.2 S-Line Our Q7 has been at the dealer for the past 45 days and they have no estimate as to when they will return it.  This car has been a nightmare.  Brakes started screeching at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years that I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (excluding scheduled maintenance).  The starter has been replaced twice which requires the entire engine to be pulled from the vehicle (nice design).  Audi does have roadside assistance which is nice since I have had to utilize this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer.  The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will! Loving it I\\'ve had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it. Mine has most of the extra bells and whistles, and I have been totally spoiled by the features - even the ones I thought I\\'d never use (keyless entry/start, lane assist, back up camera).  With the 21 inch wheels this thing corners and handles more like a sports car than a SUV. But the beefy curb weight (while providing for a sense of security and impervious-ness-ity) definitely makes for less than thrilling accelerations. I expected this though when I bought it, so no surprises there. A few minor issues with squealing brakes and the like have been promptly handled by Audi care and all-in-all I am very happy with my Q7. Disappointed Love the car except the electronics. Console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints. Really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops.  Audi will not stand behind. Cost $1000 to replace in the first 6 months. Afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect. 2 drops and another $1000. pule the hassle. Want my Range Rover back.  Great machine, but not options I have Q7 Premium S-line 4.2, absolutely great, fun to drive.  But, it would not be so great without all features. In my opinion adaptive air suspension is a must, adaptive cruise control is fun, great help, but be careful, it provides safety, but stay alert, in critical situations you need to take over. Parking sensors is also a must with such relatively large vehicle. The line assist possible saved me already from couple of dangerous situations and side assist also, although it takes some effort to learn to look at it.  A lot of features and after 5 months I am still discovering how to use them in concert effectively.  Tested BMW X5 (too small) and Merc. GL550, did not like the controls Disappointed My husband purchased this car for me and traded in our A4 cab for it. I loved it at first. Then a month into ownership, the trunk latch broke. It wouldn\\'t close all the way so I had to drive the hour away to the nearest dealership (twice) to get it fixed. 2 weeks ago, my MMI system stopped working and it was stuck to only play CDs. I took it in today and was told you\\'re out of luck because you spilled something on it. Had I known this was such a common problem, I wouldn\\'t have bought this car. Now I have to shell out the money out of pocket to replace the MMI system. After reading a bunch of reviews, it seems to be an extremely common problem.  Great fun machine in mountains Drove  4700 miles from Ohio to Wyoming and Montana, thru Chief Joseph highway and Beartooth pass. Typtronic tranmission was spectacular in moving through the passes, hair-pin turns and altitudes over 11000 ft. Six passengers very comfortable. Gas mileage acceptable and with hi speed western states 75mph limits a real dream to drive. Rear camera very helpful in parallel parking and in exiting parking lots. The water bottle storage in the doors was easy access and convienent. Air conditioning throughout the whole car was effictive. Access to rear seats challenging but once seated, very comfortable. Great car for a great trip. Car Seat in the Center Rear I love the car but am so disappointed that with a Britax diplomat infant rear-facing seat (one of the smallet, most narrow on the market) installed in the center position (the safest), I can only use one of the two adjacent seats. The other is unusable because you cannot access the seat belt buckle!  Even in my old A6 wagon this was not a problem. Further, with a carseat in the center location, it is impossible to move the seats forward to access the third row. You can move the carseat to the left or right but then your two rear passengers (imagine grandma and grandpa) are squished together and the one in the center has a very small seat. This is a silly problem to have in an SUV. Finally! No More Minivan! OK. Here we go. How do we make the case to not lease our fourth minivan in over ten years? Currently three children 10, 7 and 5. Get the whole family in the van and go visit the Q7. You won\\'t regret it I promise. I know we need all that space and cupholders, but still just go check it out...you deserve it! Maybe, just maybe, the kids can sacrifice a little for mom and dad. Afterall, this vehicle has everything you need to survive as a family of five and it performs, looks and rides like no minivan I\\'ve ever owned in the the last ten years. I drive a BMW 5 series so this is for my wife. But, this vehicle alone has made me consider an Audi for myself. Dream come true Shopped for while... Mercedes, BMW... test drove all.  All great but Q7 won. Special ordered, S-line, adaptive cruse and adaptive suspension together was worth waiting for. Love line assist and parking assist system. Bought 16GB USB drive and have all my favorite music at my steering wheel controls.  SUVs aren\\'t dead Purchased this vehicle for my wife because of increased need for space but without the minivan appearance. It has been a pleasure to drive with good handling (minimal body roll) and reasonable acceleration for the class of car. (I drive an RS4 and still enjoy the Q7). The ride can be rough, however, especially at lower speeds -- some likely related to 20\" wheels that were a part of the s-line package. Wish the air suspension was an option on the 3.6 which would likely improve ride quality. Gas mileage is reasonable with the 3.6 (21mpg at 70 mph) given size/wt of vehicle. I\\'m willing to take 5-7 mpg hit over a minivan for the sportier ride and appearance. Dream SUV Had an 02 and 05 X5 but needed something larger. Now have 3000 miles and no problems. Love the S-Line option but Audi takes 2 points off the residual value for leases which doesn\\'t seem fair when you pay more. What a bargain I have had my Q7 4.2 premium s line for about 3 weeks. I just came back from a trip to North Carolina and I am in love. I think that the best feature hands down is the lane assist; it makes everything easier and you always are aware of your surroundings. I have owned an ML, X5, Range Rover, Escalade, 4 runner, Montero, and I don\\'t regret or miss anything from those vehicles. An SUV that is actually fun to drive!! After driving a bulky Expedition for 5 years, I really wanted a car.  But with kids and lots of carpooling, a car was out of the question.  I really needed 3rd row seating. My quest was to find an SUV that handled like a car. After lots of test drives, nothing compared to driving the Audi Q7. It was actually fun to drive!  The all wheel drive makes turning ratios a breeze.  I bought the 4.2 L  and wow can it go! I love the MMI (takes a few hours to get used to but it is a great system). Seats are very comfortable, 2nd row seat huge, 3rd row I can sit in comfortably (I\\'m 5\\'6\").  Interior is so cool at night with lots of red lights.  The huge sunroof is a must.  A fantastic vehicle  I\\'ve had my Q7 for a few weeks now and I couldn\\'t be more impressed with it. The ride, design, and comfort is unsurpassed. Being a technophile, this vehicle leaves you asking for no more. The iPod/iPhone interface is seamless, the navigation is easy to use and the overall MMI provides you with any information you could ask for. I selected the adaptive air suspension option, and that has turned out to be a great option, giving the car an adjustable ride, depending on the conditions.  Easily the best SUV I\\'ve ever owned I\\'ve owned a Volvo XC90 AWD since 2004 and I was looking for a change.   I narrowed my choices down to the BMW X5, Land Rover and the Audi Q7.  After many back-to-back-to-back test drives I bought the Q7 and I have never looked back!   This car continues to impress and amaze me with it\\'s effortless driving and sumptuous interior... this is my first Audi and it won\\'t be my last.  The MMI system works great (much better than the iDrive in my wife\\'s BMW 3 series) and the advanced parking system makes short work of tight parking spaces. Rolling Thunder, A6 on Steroids This is my first return to a German car in 6 years. This car feels rock solid. The handling and seating position makes for comfortable commutes on DC\\'s Capital Beltway. The parking sensors and rear backup camera are great. The MMI and nav. system takes some setup and getting used to, but once you\\'ve mastered it, it is quick and convenient. The 6 speed auto delivers on its promises.  Better than the 07s I rented a 07 3.6 for two weeks in March. The ride is much smoother, handling not as stiff, brakes not as touchy compared to the 07 I rented. The standard front sensors and rear parking camera are incredible. The slight front bucket seats are very comfortable. The standard 20 inch wheels are a great touch at medium and high speeds but a little rigid at speeds below 45mph. Better off with these 20s than the 19s or 18s when it comes to handling.The acceleration, S turn capability, ride are perfect. Stereo system doesn\\'t get any better. For driving around town, I suggest getting the 3.6. Second row leg room would better for a SUV of this size. A Plus grade over all. Doesn\\'t Get Any Better  The 08 has front and rear parking sensors which are perfect addition. The front seats have a slight bucket which is also new. The MMI is very easy to use but have to agree with others that the nav. system takes getting used too. The handling and acceleration are incredible, taking hard S turns in the Q7 is a lot of fun. The brakes aren\\'t as sensitive as the 07\\'s. The 20 inch wheels are also standard. The ride with these at lower speeds is a little noisy but over 45 it\\'s smooth sailing. Better to have these 20s than have the 18s or 19s with less handing. This Q7 needs to be driven hard on the highways or along coastal or mountain passes. This is not a putt around town SUV. Keep looking Nothing but problems. The truck has now 62000 miles. Expect to change tires and brakes often. High pressure fuel pump went at 45k. The exhaust system had a leak at 60k. Bulbs go out frequently.  No way to reset the service intervals without visiting your dealer or spend $$$ for a vag-com cable or pay the dealer. Expect to pay a lot for regular maintenance at the dealer. Finally sold the Lemon We bought our 2009 Audi Q7 in 2013. We had it a month before it started to have problems. AC went out and then within 4 months the was water getting into the electronic module. We paid 6000 dollars for a full repair. After about two months, it happened again and Audi said they couldn\\'t warranty it because of all of the water. Now, nothing electronic works in the car. The screen, radio, navigation, airbags and fried the battery multiple times. Headlights and taillights have probably been replaced about 10 times in three years. DONT BUYTHIS CAR Great used SUC It feels a heavy truck but feel very fuel efficient.  I went on a full tank to Canada from NJ. Had a car for over three years love/hate When the car has no problems it runs great, performance is very good, ride control is spectacular ride conform on the rough side.\\r Problems i had included water inside the car because of poor design for drain pipes coming from the roof lines. All of the electronics went out, had it fixed under pre-owned warranty but had to hassle to get it done. Audi was trying to convince me that it was my problem that I did not clean the drain pipes, very hard to do especially if you don\\'t have a large garage with tons of space. Audi dealer fixed only one drain pipe the rear still collecting water in the trunk area after a car wash.\\r Rear tailgate stopped functioning, closes by itself, super dangerous. Great Suv Drives smooth plenty of pick up despite posts stating otherwise. Quattro awd system is great in bad weather and with the correct tires almost unstoppable in snow. Seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of room for the whole family. 20,000 miles and the brakes and tires are fine. I have seen posts stating otherwise but it has to do with how the car is driven. The tires will be good until 50,000 miles. Also fuel economy is not great but if you can afford the car then you can afford the gas otherwise buy a Yaris. Bad decision Have driven LR3, X5 and Q7. Q7 just doesn\\'t seem to be the same quality.Many problems - breaks wear out extremely quickly, rear lift gate problems (twice), MPG is not as advertised based on my calcs, nterior feels cramped, ergonomically uncomfortable. Teen kids keep asking when can we get a new SUV.We end up driving our BMW sedan to local ski resorts, beaches.Can\\'t wait for lease to be over. Nice Car, Loads of Rattles Purchased my Q7 in Aug 0f \\'09 and on the third day of ownership an annoying rattle developed in the sunroof, then in one of the rear quarter panels, then in the tailgate and eventually the second row seats.  Now my $60K dream car sounds like a Yugo on a logging road.  Overall I\\'m very pleased with the quality and performance of the Q7, but believe that Audi needs to dedicate more attention to the fit and finish of interior materials.  Heading down to Portland today to trade the noisy beast for a luxury car that actually rides and sounds like a luxury car.  Too Bad. Squeaking brakes & Bad Audi Srvice I bought Q7 July 2009. Brought it back to dealer immediately for squeaking brakes, not just regular squeak but the kind that people outside look over at your car-was told its normal due to heavy vehicle, could be humidity. I have AudiCare & have repeatedly asked brakes to be inspected at ea visit.  was told to spray a hose directly at brakes to reduce squeak. brought it back in around 25k miles - Service Dept told me to get on open road, drive as fast as i could without taking out a kid (yes, it\\'s what they said) and brake quickly a few times.  Really?! I just want to feel like Audi stands by their product. I thought I\\'d feel happy that we worked hard to  buy this car. I feel \"duped\" by Audi. Audi - junk...No service Do not buy! Starting from first miles till now (10k) brakes are making crazy noise. Dealer did not find any problem. But you know what is best? Customer service of Audi. They answered that this is normal because they use some new materials of braking pads. And it gives more noise than other cars. So it is normal for Audi that their 55k$ new car is giving noise on street like some 20 years junk worse 500 bucks. Do not buy Audi, do not support awful company which do not want to help its customers in any way. My is going to trade in next month. Uneven Quality There really are a lot of things to like about this car.  For an SUV, it handles like a car and is much more comfortable of a drive than most of the other luxury SUVs on the road.  However, there are a couple of things that really are unacceptable for a 60,000 car.  1. cheap plastic all over interior (see plastic foot rest just to the left of the brake pedal that cracked within a year) 2. doors are really cheap vs. bmw or mercedes. witnessed firsthand when I broke a interior mechanism in door opening on icy morning  3. MMI - why a cup holder right above a non-sealed system? 2 oz of gatorade fried out my track wheel to the tune of 800 4. handles HORRIBLY in the snow!!! 5. fuel mlg stinks Serviced more than in my driveway! Mechanically fine. Technically STINKS! MMR system, brains of car for radio, bluetooth, navigation, cameras etc., has been non-working 4 times. Front headlight blown 2 times. Window non- working. 4 Bald tires at 13,000 miles. Service takes no responsibility. Loaner car a tiny little barely 4 passenger car, paid for a Q7 that seats 7! WHAT A PIECE OF MODERN JUNK! It\\'s a beaut! I bought this car 3 months ago and now have 5000 miles on it.  Every one of those miles has been a pleasure to drive.  Who knew an SUV could be so much fun?  We\\'ve taken it on a couple camping trips already and it handled beautifully on the windy roads headed in to the mountains.  It\\'s a feeling of confidence taking tight turns in a big car with very little body lean.  I\\'ll be turning it in for its first scheduled maintenance this week and I have not had any problems yet.  This car also has plenty of room for our family of four with 2 little kids.  We also use the 3rd row frequently while carpooling with our friends\\' kids. I\\'d recommend this car to anyone looking for a luxury SUV. A Lot of Time In The Shop At the last minute we signed a lease on this car thinking we would pay it off at the end of the lease term. The first two years we had it, it was in the shop every other month. There was a problem with the AC and they kept breaking other things trying to fix it. By the time it was \\'stabilized,\\' I hated the car.  I love the way it drives and the way it looks, but I did not pay all this money to put it in the shop and drive a Hyundai.  We are eager to turn it in and put this experience behind us. We will most likely be going back to Toyota or Volvo.  I felt like the interior had a lot of plastic parts for the price.   All-in-all, my first luxury car did not turn out to be so luxurious. OK Car - Won\\'t Buy Again Car design and comfort are great.  Service, reliability and build quality are weak.  If you must have this car, you will be taking a gamble as it seems that most people will come across at least one or two issues.  Maintenance is expensive.  Can\\'t complain about fuel economy as you know what you are getting into.  Compared to other heavy cars, about the average.  The Audi Care Maintenance package only covers scheduled maintenance.  Loved the car for the first two years, then things started to fall apart. Love this car It is a great SUV if you need the space for the kids. I had a Lexus Rx 350, great car but a little boring to drive. I also has infinity Fx, Fun to drive but i needed more room. I find the Audi Q has it all, comfort, roomy, unique.. not as many Q7 as lexus and mercedes.  Pleasure on my trips I have been traveling about 450 miles 3 or 4 times each month for the last 5 years on business and pleasure. I love the fact the I am never as fatigued now as I was when I started these junkets 5 years ago in my first SUV. I have to hand it the German manufacturer. The vehicle is definitely designed for fun driving and long hauling. I also find that it handles much better in the parking lot than my previous 2 SUVs - they seem like real tanks compared to this. I purchased the Audi Care package so all of my services visits are covered by Audi. I have 21k miles now and have not spent anything on the Q7 yet.   Audi versus Acura Prior to purchasing my Audi Q7 I owned an Acura Mdx (2007) for 2 years. So I can\\'t help but make comparisons. In my view the Audi is a better looking car inside and out. It also is the better riding of the two at highway speeds (75 mph and up for sure).  It feels more like a sports sedan. Audi is geared lower than the Acura (raising the rpms considerably)  The interior really is top of it\\'s class as well.  But the Audi\\'s navigation system is completely inferior to Acura\\'s nav.  Smaller screen size and the absence of Acura\\'s joystick like control makes a huge difference  Audi\\'s system is simply frustrating to use. I give it a D.  lemon From the start of this new car i did everything audi, maintenance,  repairs, parts. After 95,000 it star to ed falling  apart. Not counting maintenance,  brakes every 15000, tires every 25,000,  i just spent $7800 on parts and labor. A car should last a bit longer then 100000 miles. a beautiful lemon I have had this car/truck/suv for 6 years now. \\rPros:\\rFirst of all, a lot of people come up and tell me how cool looking this car is. A lot of folks take pics too.\\rSecond, - the car has awesome 4WD on ice and the way it handles overtaking(passing) and gets a vroom is nice.\\rthird- the interiors are awesome looking.\\r Cons:\\ra) While under warranty the battery broke, the amplifier broke, the no sensor broke, some other  electrical issues.\\rb) as soon as the 4 year warranty ended, the ad-blue pump broke malfunctioned and had to be replaced for 2000 bucks.\\rc) on its 5 year run- the a/c compressor broke costing 3000 repairs, the rear light holder burnt, front lights broke...lemon. don\\'t buy Superb Quality-Design-Performance Excellent quality, thoughtful design, excellent performance and great mileage. Doesn\\'t drive or smell like your Dad\\'s diesel. Highly recommend for price/value ratio. Will likely exceed your expectations as it did mine - 115 mph cruising UP a 30% grade mountain road, quite,no rattles and so smooth like butter excellent feel on the wheel. No American car can compete on quality or value for a dollar. I\\'ve owned new Porsche and several new Mercedes 360SD, 450SL and 560SL - Regardless of money, I\\'d rather own this car, and that is saying a lot. Reading this you might get the impression I am not a tough critic, you would be wrong. My Best SUV ever I love this car.  The diesel engine is quiet and the mileage is exceptional.  I normally average about 24 in combined driving.  I hardly use the 3rd row except for stuff (I couldn\\'t even get back there to try it out). What I love most is the driving experience.  Everything is at your fingertips and the dash layout is intuitive.  I would recommend this car for anyone looking for great mileage, fantastic driving experience, and great service. Love my Tdi I have owned this fine vehicle for about 8,000 miles and I absolutely love it.  Aside from everything a luxury vehicle provides, this thing is quite frugal.  On long highway trips, I commonly see 27 to 29 mpg.  Driving from my home in Minneapolis to downtown St. Paul, I see MPG readings from 24 to 29 depending on how heavy traffic is.  Although the HP is lower than the V6 gas or the V8 gas engines, the torque is quite substantial and I have never felt that the vehicle was underpowered in any way.  Towing a 23\\x92 fishing boat around really exemplifies the advantage of large torque numbers. The Q7 has a super quiet interior, very comfortable.  If you are looking at the Q7, get the Tdi. q7 Diesel I\\'ve had this vehicle a little over 3 moths and really enjoy driving it.  Fit and finish on interior are excellent. Seats are very supportive and comfortable.  Handling is very good for a vehicle of this size.  Fuel economy has been better than expected.  I have about 5000 miles on vehicle and my combined average is 22.5 mpg - with mostly around town driving.  Regularly get 27-28 mpg on highway @ 75 mph and I have actually achieved over 30 mpg on a couple of longer, purely highway trips.  3rd row is very tight on legroom - really just for kids.  2nd row does adjust fore and aft to provide some slight relief for 3rd row passengers.   Never purchase a Q7 The Q7 is just an average SUV, the electronics are really bad and confusing, maintenance and repair costs are very high Great reliable car. Drives like a tank. Built very solid.... brake issues at low mileage Front brake noise first appeared at ~13K. Had an oil change done at 15K only find out that we are staring at brake job, pads and rotors, for both front and rear, estimated at $1,600. Both dealerships commented on this as \"normal wear\" and so did Audi Customer Care. Dealing with Customer Care is a joke. Apparently my 20+ year driving experience and owning multiple SUVs/trucks and not having the brakes shot at 15K means nothing. I suggested that the dealer pays for rotors and I pay for pads, so will hear back from Audi in a couple of days. Complaints about the breaks/rotors replacement at early mileage is something that various Audi forums cover well. Thinner break pads (7mm) vs. other luxury SUVs and softer break pad material, all seem to contribute to the issue of premature brake failure. Single use rotors, which are not supposed to be serviced until ~35,000 miles according to Audi Q7 Maintenance Schedule, need to be replaced with every brake job, which can drive the cost up to $2,000 for parts and labor. I\\'m excited at the 2017 Q7, but who needs a brake job that soon, so may not be trading in next year. I almost love this car! As an owner, you know that every car purchase has some degree of weighing the vehicle\\'s pros against its cons.  As long as you go into this with your eyes wide open and willing to accept the cons, your satisfaction is likely to be high.  And, so it is for the Q7.  This TDI has fantastic fuel economy, gobs of power, handles well for the 5,500# beast it is, looks classy, rides like a dream, and is comfortable enough to drive all day every day without fatigue.   So, what are the cons?  Well, two major things:  1., space use for cargo is horrible; Audi really should have made the car six inches taller.  As it is, cargo room is quite height-limited, and this is something I find quite annoying (quite often).  The fact that it has a third row for seating simply means that there is less cargo space for a useless row that no normal (or even relatively small) human can use with any level of practicality.  2., Too many sensors.  If anyone ever asked the question, \"Is it possible for a car to have too many sensors?\"  Audi answered it for us:  Yes, it is!!!!!  Honestly, many of the sensors main purpose in life is to give false-positives because they are in damage-prone areas and are for things that even the worst car owner should be entirely capable of managing on their own.  Example?  Brake pad sensors.... seriously! Audi Q7 tdi premium plus This is a great car. Best for long range trip. Audi Q7 Prestige Tire and maintenance are very expensive front interior I\\'m frustrated with the layout of the center console:I have to take my eye off the road to use the radio/navigation MMI controls.Also the same with the cup holders as they are too far back.Voice control doesn\\'t understand my commands or maybe I don\\'t understand what to say.Radio knob is out of the way and when out of my usual territory it is difficult to find a radio station.The cruise control is visually difficult to see.I don\\'t like the wiper system as when I turn them on the rear wipers seem to go on too due to its location on the stick.Vehicle has a lot of road noise.I thought I\\'d get better fuel mileage with the diesel but am only getting 25 mpg on the highway. Garbage in Garbage out So I am no longer a member of the Audi family. I owned my 2011 Audi Q7 for 6 years and for the most part it was alright. My biggest complaint is the maintenance. Every single service I had done was done at a Certified Audi Dealer, yet after 3 years the thermostat went out, exactly right after the warranty had expired. To make up for this, Audi did not pay for the repair, they did offer to cover my service through 75,000 miles. Fast forward 2 1/2 years and my 6 weeks after my 85,000 mile service my coolant light comes on and I take it back  to Phil Long Audi here in Colorado Springs. To my surprise the thermostat again needs to be replaced because it is leaking, as well as an additional 2K in suggested repairs. So 6 weeks after a service and an \"Audi World Class\" Inspection at  certified dealer, the car basically fell apart. I contacted Audi of America and they offered me a 25% discount on the Thermostat repair only as a good will gesture, what a crock. They do not stand behind there product as long as there is a buck to be made and I refuse to do business like that no mater how \"nice\" there cars are. Excellent Family Car This Q7 replaces my 2008 A4.Q7 is huge.A lot of room.I love the 3.0 Supercharge engine with 8 speed auto.Pickup is very smooth.Mileage is OK. It does better than my 2005 X5 3.0i.It feels very heavy and during braking, I need to step heavier to stop it.I took it to the snow and it was fun driving at 70mph and passing other cars with chain.It is a excellent family car. Truly A Luxury SUV Finally broke 1k miles on my Q7. I along side of my 2002 audi s4 and 2004 audi a6 2.7t; the Q7 makes a great family SUV, I had custom dvd entertainment install and my kids loves it while on the road.  With a lot of mix city and highway I average around 20 mpg.  I tested droved the 2010 x5 with v8 setup and merc gl 550 both did not have the solid feel and quality interior.  The X5 was very responsive on the road and sporty while the Merc felt too calm and soft on the road while the q7 had the balance of both worlds. 2011 Q7 3.0T Premium Plus  Have only had our Q7 for 1000 miles now, but it\\'s  been wonderful to drive. I traded in my 2007 Q7 3.6 and haven\\'t looked back. The standard horsepower 3.0T has more than sufficient power and has more torque than my old 3.6 /gets 18 mpg vs 16 mpg in my last q7. It certainly isn\\'t a rocket ship but rides smooth and handles very well for such a large heavy vehicle. The 8 speed  transmission is smooth and the rapid gear shifts are subtle and fast. To get the best gas mileage stay in D, switch to sport mode and the Q7 transforms it\\'s feel very nicely if you want to attack a curvy back road or aggressively pass another vehicle on the highway. This is an excellent all around family vehicle Great SUV I have had the car for only 2 weeks, but so far it\\'s been great. For such a heavy SUV it feels light under acceleration, but leans a little in corners due to the weight. The 3.0T feels more responsive than the TDI. The torque in the gas engine isn\\'t quite as good, but still feels like plenty. The gas engine feels more alive and is funner to drive.  It is very nice inside and out. However, some things like plastic interior door handles, cheap feeling engine start/stop button, make it seem slightly less expensive than a BMW, Lexus, or Mercedes. It still feels solid overall though.  Noticed a couple very small paint blemishes I have not had on other cars I\\'ve owned. Overall happy with the car! Love mine so far I received one of the first q7 sline trims in the Midwest. So far I love it. Drives like a sports sedan. Comfortable but now wallowing like other big suvs. My First Audi The Q7 replaced my Mazda CX-9, which comes off lease next month. So far I\\'m loving it. I test drove 10 different SUVs, and kept coming back to the Q7. Very pleased it\\'s in my garage. Orca black with gray interior. We will never let it go My wife was first introduced to the Q7 in 2009 when her cousin came down from Boston in hers.  My wife fell in love with the drivability, the appointments, and it not having the stigma of elitism (buying a brand badge versus a quality car).  Most of the people we knew at the time had never heard of Audi.  Maybe because we were too poor to even afford one, but we all knew Mercedes and BMW!  My wife didn’t want to drive a badge, she wanted to drive a well-crafted machine that would last a long time.  A few years later, I found a lease return TDI Prestige in Florida that was well priced.  I jumped on it.Why really did we want the Q7 over anything else?  We wanted a 7 passenger vehicle.  There are only four of us in the family, but randomly we will transport friends to and from school and ball games.  So the third row seat didn’t need to cavernous, just legal for short trips.  We wanted a comfortable long distance vehicle.  We regularly travel 2,500 miles across the United States, so we desired something comfortable.  I’m 6’1” and many vehicles don’t fit me.  This fit me like a glove.  In these travels, we travel through all types of weather, including snow.  We also travel back roads a bit also, so we desired a four wheel drive.  We needed something that could tow a 5,000 pound camper.  And we desired 20+ mpg.  This wish list narrowed us down very quickly.  The Q7 was at the top of the list.With nearly 180,000 miles on our Q7, we have done NO major maintenance.  Brakes, oil, tires, battery and other small things like this; but we have done nothing major.  We continue to drive this car as our primary cross-country conveyance.  We have no squeaks, no rattles, no clunks and to broken nobs.  The seats have no tears, rips or bad wearing spots.  This car has really held up to my family.  It has truly held up to the price I paid for it.  Even my fuel mileage increased as I put miles on it.  Currently, we average 25 MPG on the highway, and around 18 in the city.The bad:The OEM brakes.  This is a heavy machine, and the brakes remind you that it is heavy!  Our first brake replacement, we upgraded the rotors and pads and reprogrammed the sensitivity of the brake pedal.  It made an immense difference.Tires.  This is a heavy machine, and it eats tires faster than a minivan.  I finally went to a Conti DWS with a 50,000 warranty.  This way, every time I swap tires at about 40,000 miles, I get $125 discount off the new set.  MMI  The interface with the computer is like jumping from Windows to Apple.  There is a lot of getting used to the strange interface.  My wife loves it, so I won’t expound on it! First Audi and LOVING it... This is my first Audi and I\\'m really loving it.I\\'ve never owned a Diesel auto before but the gas mileage is great.But the fuel is more expensive so I\\'m not sure if it\\'s not a wash by the time it\\'s all said and done. Here in CA, diesel is at least 30 cents more per gallon for diesel vs. unleaded.The quality is great and I\\'m at 3,500 miles and not any problems at all. It runs smoothly and I\\'m averaging about 22 miles per gallon driving a mix of the city and highway (mostly city). I\\'ve averaged about 560 miles on a full tank of gas. The tank holds 26 gallons of diesel fuel.I test drove many different SUV\\'s including Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, and a few others but none could compare @ 3,000 miles Traded in Allroad (wish they still sold that in US) for diesel - like the excellent mileage and lower emissions. Decision motivated by lower environmental impact. Compared to BMW X5, LR4, Lexus, MB BluTech. Excellent choice if you need space and winter surefootedness. Lots of torque, but it\\'s a heavy car (noticeable in stop-and- go traffic). Drives very well - particularly on highway. Towing package did not include electrical harness - took a day at dealership to install. Major irritation is driver\\'s seat position - simply too high for comfortable posture.  Love my diesel My first diesel was a 1975 Mercedes Benz 240d.  Diesel technology has come quite a long way.  This is my second Audi, I did not think the A6 could be beat but Audi figured out how to do it.  Amazing family truckster.  Huge size but drives smaller than it is. It\\'s awesome It\\'s a great car that seems to hold its value. 82,000 miles and I have had no hiccups! Best Audi so far.  We have had the A7 for a few months now. This car is amazing, it\\'s a real head turner. With the ability to change the drive, is amazing. For me Dynamic is great, and for my wife comfort is great. The only down side to this car is the small head room in the rear. Audi has hit a real home run with this car!!! A7, great new car  I was looking for a 4 door car can hold 2 golf clubs and good seats for long travel.I test drove A7 a month ago and I was so impressed with performance, handling, ride, dash board and everything.This is my first Audi I purchased and I am having so much fun driving.This car is so lively, smooth and never get boring. I still own Bentley GT and I would say A7 is as good as Bentley GT and this is more like little sister of Bentley GT.A7 has so much power, fast and fun to drive. Entertainment system and navigation system is much better than Bentley GT.  New A7 on the block  I am along time Audi guy having early 80\\'s coupe, 4000cs, 90cs, S5 turbo, 2- A8\\'s, now a 2012 A7. The last time I talked to a dealer (8 months ago) I was salivating to buy a 2011 A8 ,but it was just too much $ for todays economy. I pulled over 3 weeks ago to look at the used s8\\'s and then bang! I was hooked, what great lines and style the A7 car designers came up with. It\\'s stance is agressive, swooping back with a great a** to boot (no pun intended).The A7 allows a more connected driver\\'s experience and pulls with great torque from a supercharged 6 .If you want a more connected experience in the drivers seat, the a7 does not disappoint. Dynamic and Sport mode for optimumexperience. excellent ride dissapointing reliability This is a spectacular looking car that feels great on the road however the leather seats started fading within few years only and MOST importantly  as I just passed 100kmiles it started burning oil....of course any major repair is as much as paying for a monthly lease of a new car so I would not recommend you keeping it after the lease is up..... Performance and Class Test drove nearly a dozen cars prior to selecting our new Audi A7.  Wife wanted luxury and reliability and I wanted performance and fun.  It wasn\\'t until we looked at the A7 that we found the right combination.  I know you may be thinking \"but you bought the diesel\".  Well test drive the TDI and tell me it doesn\\'t put a grin on you face with all the torque on tap and we just got 39 MPG on a 800 mile trip.  I would classify the car as a GT and in this regard it excels.  It comfortably seats 4 and can still put a smile on your face on a twisty canyon road.  Is it going to hang with a 911......No, but you can\\'t put all your luggage, the dog and 4 people in the 911 either.  The TDI has a slight diesel rumble at idle when cold that is barely noticeable (if you have everything in the car turned off....heater, stereo, etc..) Once in gear and rolling, the car is very quiet and amazingly the TDI has an un-diesel like growl to it when you drop the hammer.  The transmission is super smooth and seems to always be in the right gear for what you want the car to do.  The interior and technology of the car is as cutting edge as your wallet will allow (options) but even the base model is nicely equipped and very functional.  The headlights and interior lighting make nighttime driving less stressful for those that may not see as well at night as they use too.  The A7 has real usable storage space, every person I have shown the lift back to has been amazed at how much storage there is (notice I didn\\'t use the word trunk space as no trunk can compare, it closer to an SUV than a car).   In conclusion, after testing every reasonable car in the midsize luxury GT class I am happy with my purchase and would recommend the vehicle to others. Why did I wait this long Best car I’ve ever owned.  Been looking for a while but didn’t think I’d really pull the trigger.  Saw mine on line and made an impromptu stop to look at it.  GREAT expirence with the dealer and car was better than I imagined.  CPO with low miles and a great maintainence history, hopefully I will avoid some of the “issues” I hear about.  So far my only regret is I waited this long to purchase one. VeVe needs an upgrade I thoroughly enjoyed this car for the 4 years that I have driven it. Beautiful, sleek and I loved the big trunk and hatchback feature. I traded it in for the Q5 which arrives next week. Ordered the same prestige upgrades and am looking forward to the ride! Great package This car has great practicality and like previously mentioned, a real head turner. The car has plenty of pep and is well balanced with braking and handling. Even with all season tires on the car, this thing corners amazingly well! With the Quattro system pulling through corners, let\\'s just say I give up before the car will. Purchased this car CPO, having already driven it 8500 miles, it\\'s been a great buy. 2013 A7 with Prestige and Innovation Pkg If you want ALL of the great tech features, find a 2013 A7 Prestige with the Innovation Package. It has the now hard to find \"Night Vision\" along with head up display, adaptive cruise, active lane assist + all of the blind spot monitors. It also has 5 cameras for a 360 view. Best looking Audi to date. Oolong Gray Metallic is a hard to find color. All around joy to drive. Night Vision \"sees\" people and animals 500 feet ahead of you. Cruises the highways like it\\'s on rails and the A7 design still turns heads. Amazingly fun and practical! Supercharged 3L has abundant power immediately (pulling out onto busy highway traffic is easy)!  The hatchback design is super practical with tons of cargo space (coming from a wagon, I don\\'t even miss it)!  The big tires are expensive but inspire extreme confidence (especially in the wet)!  I trust my dealership but I am in there more than I would like for different random things.  I\\'ve barked the passenger side rear tire/wheel two times on curbs taking tight turns - you\\'ve been warned. Look somewhere else \"Brand new with 95 miles on it and it broke less than 24 hours after driving it off of the lot. O2 sensor was bad and an actuator (whatever that is) needed to be moved.Start-stop is very inconsistent.Plastic modeling near side mirror had to be replaced and whole car started to shake from defrost on 4/9. Cruise control is very poor (jumpy, not smooth). Climate control also acts like Jeckel and Hyde. Overall the car is worth about $40,000. The only thing going for it is that it looks great. Needs an economy mode as the computer often chooses a gear to low for economy. Audi has offered little help!Car was eventually replaced after I filed a lemon law complaint.  New car also has a few bugs but much better than the first.  However, car has a MSRP of over $72,000 and has been to the shop twice in the first 3 months. Not good!  I would avoid Audi at all costs.New car still has an issue with the radio presets not working properly and has been looked at over 8 times in two years.  Finally Audi admitted in writing that they are aware of the problem. Only took me about 22 months to get them to acknowledge the issue.  Quality of a $30,000 car for more than double the price.  That sums up an Audi in my opinion.  Service is no better than buying a Ford, GM, Honda, etc.; quality is the same and the cost is double.  However it does look good. First week with the 2013 audi a7 premium plus  Picked up our new a7 a few days ago. Car has the following options: bench rear seat for 3 passengers (new for 2013), cold weather package, side assist. Our previous car was a 2010 Audi a6 prestige. Basic bottom line - the changes Audi has made since 2010are huge. car handles better and has improved engine/transmission performance. Inside of cabin is superbly designed . only negatives are: comes with start/stop technology - thank goodness it can be disabled with a dash switch; the steering wheel adjustment handle is made of cheap lightweight plastic not suitable for a car of this price; the emergency brake is automatically applied and released - what if it fails in the engaged position?  Audi A7 It is a great car in every way except paying for it.  While the purchase price was ok, maintenance is expensive. My Wife Calls it \"The Spaceship\", I call it Heaven I recently leased a white over black A7 Prestige with the Driver Assist, B&O, 19\" Sport, and Comfort Seating packages along with a few other options.  I also had the windows tinted, which in Florida is a big help.  The car looks fantastic without being overly showy - I wanted something that didn\\'t advertise it\\'s price too loudly.  The car is very fast but in a very subtle way... I find myself doing 100 feeling like I would doing 60 in a lesser car.  Exceptionally quiet and smooth riding.  A far as comfort, the heated/cooled seats work very quickly and the massage function on the Comfort Seating Package is ridiculously great.  I find myself using it almost 100% of the time. The seats themselves offer as many adjustments as I could imagine and are very comfortable and supportive when cornering quickly.   The B&O stereo is outstanding, although I miss a graphic equalizer.  The AC is somehow 10x better than my last BMW, both faster and stronger.  Where I was running the old AC at 63-65 degrees, I\\'m at 69-72 with this car.  The 4G hotspot works well and saves my cell phone\\'s data plan.  The only negatives I can think of are that Apple CarPlay still doesn\\'t support  apps I consider necessary like Waze and the SiriusXM app.  Also driving with all the tech options activated it can be a bit overwhelming (hence my wife\\'s nickname).  If you want to just drive the car I suggest the following: Put down the LCD screen using the button on the dash, it will pop up only when needed (this also looks cool).  Turn off all the driver assist functions and the HUD and you\\'re basically driving a really fast, super quiet car that happens to be massaging you while making love to your eardrums.  I find myself driving for hours sometimes at night just to enjoy the car.  Highly recommended. Awesome Audi A7  Slick, Hot, Functionally Awesome love the car and edmonds blog tremendously helpful in negotiating the lease. My Third Childhood... I traded a 2013 Lexus ES350 for the A7.  The Lexus was the best car I\\'ve ever owned, comfort-wise, overall performance, etc..  But the ES is a smooth sedan, without much punch.  The Audi, in comparison, is that redhead in high school you wished you\\'d asked to the prom, just to see what might happen after the prom!  It is fun, and that sums it up.  It\\'s over priced; for the money one can choose from an array of fine rides, BMW, Mercedes, maybe a Jag, any of which could get your blood flowing.  But this a vehicle you won\\'t see too many of on the street.  It truly stands out with great styling.  I\\'ve had no less than four strangers tell me what a fine looking auto the A7 is.Audi is famous for beautiful interiors and this car has one.  The interfaces, voice or touch, are superior to the Lexus, in my opinion, very nice for a non-techie such as myself.  The media interface alone is marvelous.At first I wasn\\'t sure about the feature where the engine shuts off at red lights (on or off, your choice), but have come to appreciate the option, especially since premium fuel is strongly recommended, the main negative thus far.  The restart is nearly seamless and I expect we\\'ll see this in many more cars in the future.Overall, this is the most fun, best driving vehicle I have ever owned.  The vehicle continues to garner off the street positive comments, two years in.  How am I going to get a cooler car to replace this one? I never want to be without one! This is my second A7, and the improvements in performance, reliability, style, and technology are significant. I chose this car above all German and Japanese equivalents, and it was no contest. Ease off the line and it rolls sedately forward. Crush the pedal and it pins you back in the seat, the engine giving a subtle growl that quickly becomes a roar. 70mph comes fast, as the steering, handling, and balance tighten. It is the best performing sedan I\\'ve ever driven. Hit the gas out of the apex and it hunkers down and rockets out of the turn. The curve speed sign says 40mph? Try 70 and you will be fine. The interior is sumptuous, ergonomic, and classy without being fussy. The electronic systems are user-friendly but have layers and layers of functionality once you start exploring. In the snow, this car outperforms the most eager SUV. Speaking of SUVs, when you open the lift gate you have a storage cave that serves almost any cargo need. Every possible situation was contemplated with this car. This A7 feels like an extension of me--more so the longer I own it. And as with my 2012, the 2016 turns heads and solicits conversation wherever I go. I have the Mythos black with Nougat interior, and it couldn\\'t be more compelling. The car exudes understated success and standing, and imbues the same upon its driver. My only fear is that one day Audi will stop making the A7. It\\'s that good. Happy in Virginia I owned a 2011 Porsche Panamera that burned up in interstate 95 on the way to vacation. Prior to the fire I was looking at the Audi line of cars. After quite a bit of research I decided on a Audi A7 due to its versatility and great interior. I didn\\'t go back to Porsche because of their lack of concern when my car caught fire!! I was planning on buying off of the local dealer but they told me it would take 90-120 days to order the A7 configured the way I wanted it. I got on the net and connected with Lauren Whitcraft at Rick Case Audi in the Atlanta area. She located a dealer who had a car that was being built in Germany and traded one of their vehicles. In a little over three weeks she notified my car was ready to go. I must add that we did the deal over the phone in thirty minutes from the time I called initially. I flew to Atlanta on a morning flight and she picked me up at the airport. After I hit the road I drive from Atlanta to Richmond in a constant rain. My new Audi A7 impressed me the entire trip averaging 37.5 mph. I have owned a ton of cars and this one is a keeper. On a recent trip I averaged 42.6 mph(diesel). My wife keeps telling how much she like the A7 and just smile and go \"yes I do. I really with I could complain about something but I can\\'t. I am looking forward to taking a long trip some day soon. In closing I can tell you this puppy is pretty darn fast too. It midrange acceleration does not seem to bog down until I loose my nerve....Did I say I love my A7? I can\\'t wait until the 2016 Q7 comes out so we can fly to Atlanta and replace my wife\\'s vehicle. Classic Design with Utility and Performance! This car is faster than my 2008 Boxster S, and can get 34 mpg on a highway when driven at moderate speeds. It\\'s gorgeous from any angle and as a hatchback, can hold a ton with rear seats down.    Buy it with low mileage (5K) and you have the best of all worlds!  Can\\'t say enough about it\\'s power (Supercharged 6 cyl), stability (Quattro)  and sleek lines.  Strangers compliment it\\'s looks, with Daytona Gray Metallic and 20\" wheels. Almost There Very comfortable, and responsive, but feels heavy and the turning radius is not great. The perfect fit for man and machine It is just an awesome car to drive.  The power, the handling, the creature comforts like massaging  seats, heated steering wheel and adaptive cruise control are all seductively pampering.  And then to have all of that and hit 29mpg on a long trip..... awesome. 2012 A8L has some LEMONS to admit and RESOLVE Audi is building a few (hopefully) LEMONS and attempting to outrun their flawed automobiles with marketing dollars.A search of the AUDI forums disclose a number of late model A8L vehicles with similar problems and alack of acknowledgement by Audi that they intend to stand behind their warrantees.Audi is intimidating dealers, directing them to not service the car or refusing to pay them for warrantee repairs.Seat sensor - airbag deactivation Mirror heat not workingtranny hard downshift Radio station refresh Cell phone pairing failsConsole rattle Door close/locks malfunction when cold Clunk on accelerationMMI system fails to play .wav and .flac files Int lighting flickers The best Luxury Car money can buy!!! I had a 2006 750LI and loved this car. Traded for a 2009 Audi A8L and while was a great car, didn\\'t have enough pizazz.Traded it for a 2010 Mercedes S-Class.Was a good car but too soft.Felt floaty.Bought a 2011 Eguus, while a good car, too jittery and not refined.Now comes the new 2012 Audi A8L!Unbelievable car.Out drives and performs better than all of the above.Feels like you\\'re driving a Bentley for half the price.Fit and finish, impeccable.Ride is stiff when needed and firm at just the right time.I\\'m a car buff as you can see by all the cars I purchase and I\\'m more impressed with this car than any of the large luxury cars I\\'ve owned, including my past 2009 A8L. A Great Car I\\'ve had this car since new and have @ 67,000 miles on it. Had an extended warranty that was a nice addition, b/c out of warranty repairs can be costly. It most comfortable and the gas economy tho not great can be up in the 25-26 range on a trip. One of the drains on the sunroof still is blocked after 2 attempts to fix. All Cars have Maintenance Costs. Bought the car certified-preowned, (used). Car was in a front end/rear end collision so price was lower than listed. In spite of the collision history, body panel fit is excellent. Things that have gone wrong...whoever put the drain system for the moonroof in did so incorrectly causing a leak when it rained, the dealer took three trys to get it fixed. Other than that MAP air sensor, trans filter service and power steering fluid leak repair. Above and regular maintenance is all that I\\'ve had to have done to the vehicle. Out of warranty so sought out non-dealer service which halved the cost of repairs.  All around best used car I ever bought Dumped my 06 R350, to much time in the shop and issues never fixed. Should have got an another Audi-well now I have- this is my 2nd one and I love the big car feeling, plenty of power, great handling all the creature comforts, get one used if you can and save a few $$. Put 9k miles on it so far and it just does what it supposed to do! It now has 145k and feels like new. Great car. \"Extended Warranty Required\" The Germans have created cars with the philosophy that performance is the measure of quality. They have forgotten that durability and reliability are paramount to quality. Anyone who buys a used Audi A8 without an extended warranty will soon find the purchase economically untenable. The electrics rival those of 60\\'s British autos. These cars are mechanically, electrically and economically a nightmare. The worst part of the experience is how arrogant they are about it. 2001 A8 D2 Quattro 4.2L V8 5V This car is probably the best I have ever had to deal with. Unlike Chryslers, Volkswagens (you\\'d think they were the same, but they\\'re not), GM, and Acura (which are quite reliable too), this car has run like a Mack truck practically, performed beyond belief, and given me a solid 22 mpg out of a full-size luxury sedan. The grip is tenacious for a 4057 lb. car and enables the driver to make quick lane changes if need be (Columbus traffic isn\\'t the most forgiving). All in all, this car is a keeper. Great car, but make sure it\\'s certified Over the past three years, it seems like my A8L has been in the shop as much as in the garage. Fortunately, it was Certified, so except for the $50 deductible and inconvenience, it has been relatively painless. Here is a listing of problems: Thermostat (replaced along with timing belt @ 50K miles), vacuum hoses/connectors, Torque converter/Transmission (required replacement), peeling console material, etc. etc. etc.... A8 in north palm beach I purchased an A8L and I am very pleased. You never see a lot of A8 s on the road so your A8 stands out at being different. The cabin is so quiet that when you go through the brushless car wash and the dryers turn on you hear the fan motors instead of the wind noise.I sold a Porsche 911 for the A8 and I am very surprised with the performance. The off the line acceleration is very quick and smooth as it holds you back in the seat through all of the gears. My buddies have 745s, and Lexus 430s and they prefer to take the A8 the very few times we get together. Last but not least the build quality is Impressive because the car is all aluminium and straight as a arrow, seams, and door jams. I love my Audi This is a great vehicle for a full size sedan. It has plenty of power and drives like a sports car. Should the flagship retire? Vehicle has been a constant source of satisfaction from design and function point of view. Quattro is to die for when you live on top of a mountain in NE. Car gets many looks. Classy, understated but luxurious, especially with rear and side shades up. Formula shifting and 310 HP makes it a L&P vehicle. Too bad Audi can\\'t engineer a car that\\'s not in for repairs as often as it\\'s being enjoyed. Audi A8 It\\'s very fun to drive, turns heads, and likely to be in the shop getting expensive repairs.  This car, and Audis in general, are notorious for developing lots of little oil leaks. For some reason, the oil seals and gaskets only last about three or four years.  The parts are not expensive, but the labor is.  So they drop in price very quickly once the warranty expires.  This can be a great bargain if you are moderately skilled at doing your own repairs, or a great expense if you pay dealership labor rates.  Objective Review I\\'ve driven Mercedes, Lexus, BMW\\'s, \\rCadillac\\'s, and although some of them \\rhad more gadgets, more power or were \\rmore quiet, none of them felt as solid \\rand rigid as the 2001 Audi A8. Personally, the \\rrarity of this vehicle is a big plus \\rfor me, and that is complemented by a \\rsolid ride, more than average \\rcomfort and very acceptable \\rperformance for such a heavy car, not \\rto mention the Quattro, which shines \\rin every aspect. Its fuel economy is not \\rgreat, but frankly which car in this \\rcategory gives more than 15 mpg. This \\rcar may not be a rocket, or turn \\ron a dime, but whatever \\rperformance number it reaches, it does \\rin a very smooth and effortless way. \\rAdd to this a warranty until 2007 or \\r100,000 miles. Love This Car! Bought the car a little over a year \\rago while still under warranty. Just \\rpast 50k miles, so no longer will get \\rfree maintenance. Very good driving \\rcar. Everyone who gets in it marvels \\rat how smooth and quiet the ride is. \\rAbsolutely excellent in the snow. \\rGreat on the highway for long rides. \\rOnly had to replace a tie rod which I \\rthink got damaged when a hit a wicked \\rpot hole in NYC. Love the sound \\rsystem. Could use more cup holders, \\rwhich I think was done with new \\'04 \\rmodel. Will definitely consider buying \\ranother one in a few years...and \\rthat\\'s unusual for me to get the same \\rcar again. Says something about this \\rcar. FUN I took this car for test drive and had \\rto have it. That 310 HP V8 is just \\rawesome - powerful, smooth and very \\rquiet. I cruise at 90-100 mph and can \\rbarely hear the engine running. \\r Great value for high end car!!! Car drives like a dream.  Its a little \\rslow off the line, but when it gets \\rgoing, wow!  Lots of room and many \\rupgrades.  You must consider when, \\rlooking in the large sedan category. GREAT CAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why pay the big boys what they want, \\rthis car is right there with them.  \\rThis is pure heaven.  My warranty goes \\runtil 2007.  what a deal. rattles I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THE CAR AGAIN!\\rThe car rattles badly. the dealer \\radmits to the rattles privitely but \\radmits they can`t fix them.The car has \\rbeen in the shop for so many days I \\rlost count.Other problems included \\rmultiple electronic failures, gas gauge \\rfailure, acceleration override problems \\rwhere the engine management system \\rretards acceleration when you move \\rquickly from the brake to the  \\raccelerator before the brake pedel \\rcontacts a relay that allows the \\raccelerator to engage. No help from \\raudi to correct the problem has been \\rforthcoming, in spite of dealing with \\rhigh level customer service personel  \\r    My favorite vehicle I have had Range Rover, Jaguar, Porsche, Lexus, BMW but for some reason - this Audi has been my all time favorite. The car exterior doesn\\'t really look that stylish, that and what i would consider rather poor gas mileage are the only 2 knocks I\\'d give the car. But everything else - is off the charts. The acceleration, the comfort, the gadgets, its performance in snow, the stereo system, the interior - all are top notch. I feel like a pilot more than a driver getting in and out of this car!  This car does not disappoint. However, like alot of the more expensive European cars - make sure you do your homework before buying the car. If the car was taken care of, it is built to last. Waste of time and money Yes its a luxurious car, awesome look/appearance, sound of V8 and exhaust are exciting. Interior specious but cargo space is smaller than chevy malibu.  From day one vehicle shows to be a very time consuming burden. I can easily afford kep up of this expensive vehicle but no mater where you go not a single shop is happy to service this poorly built non sense. The vehicle is so unpopular that even dealer has no idea of occurring problems and how addressing the issue. Motor started to leak oil by 80k miles, my work vehicle chevy impala ith over 200k miles does not have a motor leak as of yet. Suspension went down due to front shock leaks. AC system had hose leak. Later sunroof began to stock. Interior: Privacy curtain has ripped, transmission shift cover broke in half, passenger seat leather ripped and was impossible to replace got it done though. All of the interior buttons peeled making car look very trashy got it replaced, later drop down mirrors in the back broke. By that time cost came over $13k on maintenance while value of the car went down by more than a half. Then I got tired of looking for a shops that would fix this so called car when dealer could not. Got rid of it and my life became a life again. Luxury Driving At Its Nicest Everytime I see my car I just smile knowing what a beautiful choice I made. I love the curvature and design of the car. I love the ride. The pickup is there if you need it but for style and handling it is pure luxury and I am as happy as the 1st day I got my car. The car does things I never thought existed. Roomy as heck in the back....more than enough for anyone of any size. Couldntve made a happier automobile owner. The Best of 2005 luxury car I traded in my big failure 07 BMW X5 with this beauty : and I am very pleased with this move. . It was nightmare to own a very expensive SUV like the07 X5 ( top of the line ) which give us only troubles... the driving of this car is nothing close to any of BMW & MB .. I drove the S class, C63 -AMG ,as well as the BMW , but never tried the Audi which I realize the mistake I did .. This car is a luxury feeling , sporty feeling , fun feeling.. great interior , high quality material , smooth engine.. This isthe one to have in your Garage for all season ... you should know that you will not be able to drive MB in snow... It was a big failure m at least to me... most expensive POS audi i ever bought!!!!!!!! i bought 2005 audi a8 back of 2009 ever since then i have problem with this car.started with tire pressure coming on for no reason.other issue, battery always discharging completely even nothing on.This car is probably the worst car out there.If anyone thinking buying one,you better think again!!.i did some research with this car before i bought it.They have desame issue im having since i got it.i should listen to other people.unless you willing to be at shop every week and spend alot of money.2005 audi a8 PSO thats the 3 letters for this car.beware!!!!!!!!never going buy audi again. Beauty with flaws This is my second A8 and I really love this car, but this might be the last one. These cars are very costly to maintain. Things like suspension parts breaking on a car with 32000 miles shouldn\\'t happen, especially on a car driven very carefully on paved roads. Also electric gremlins that shouldn\\'t happen, like parts breaking when I had it in for a software upgrade for other problems(telephone module broke). But, it looks and handles like a million dollars when it\\'s not in the shop!  A8=Great! I purchased my A8 a year ago and have found it to be a very pleasing car to drive. The car was certified and in the 18,000 miles I\\'ve driven it, there have been zero problems.  My car came with 19\" wheels but I had a set of 18\" from a previous car and when the tires on the 19\\'s were worn, I replaced them with the 18\" wheels. This resulted in a quieter and more compliant ride with no noticeable degradation of the handling (for my driving style). The A8 pleases me greatly and I plan to keep it for a while as I don\\'t care for the newer \"Big Mouth\" front design of the \\'06 on models.  Service is expensive but Audi does sell a prepaid package that is well worth the money. Overall, a great ride. Poor Quality Purchased a certified pre-owned with 25k miles.  Has been in the dealer 17 times within a little over a year of ownership: sunroof not closing, improperly designed thermostat (Audi\\'s words not mine), Software controller staying and draining battery ($450 to replace, not covered under warranty). Leader in quality and comfort This is best car I have had after owning several BMW models. 2005 models came with bluetooth in later production model which apparently are way more reliable than the one\\'s with OnStar*. The only maintenance I have done over the last year is brakes and oil changes. It\\'s hard to drive anything else once you get used to fine interior and futuristic interior. Seats are best in this class of cars. Check details online the way this car is being produced, all aluminum chassis and adjustable suspension modes provide superb ride quality. I prefer SWB over L because of aesthetics. Rear seats still provide a lot of room. MMI is easy to use and Bose stereo is the best I have come across. PPI is a must. Horrible Experience I purchased a 2005 CPO A8L 6 months ago. From the day I drove it off the lot I have had nothing but trouble. From the minor (ie. remote keys didn\\'t work) to the major items (ie. sunroof, power trunk, console buttons, water pump, head lamps, etc.) my vehicle has been in the shop a total of 3 weeks. The CPO checklist was a total misrepresentation. Most of the items that were bad on the vehicle were checked off as having passed a \"rigorous\" inspection. I have owned several other luxury new and used brands. But I never had this kind of trouble before. Truly a horrible experience. The final slap in the face is the trade value. All I want to do is trade out of this car but the values are way down. Oh yea Just bought a used A8L Quatrro.Man This thing is fantastic. Never owned a luxury car before,and now I know what I have been missing. The soft market on these vehicles put them in reach for those of us with the \"beer pocket\". I am hooked. Handling is wonderful and the power from the 4.2 is plenty for any American highway. I had to study the owners manual while I sat in the car and go step by step over all the systems. There are a lot of buttons and dials and submenus to learn. If you buy one of these cars take the time to learn it inside and out. It will make the experience so much better I love this car I bought a certified pre-owned 2005 A8L and have enjoyed every element of this car, from the handling to the styling. I will say that the cost of repairs is high, but probably comparable to others in its class. I had to replace a rear view mirror and one arm rest and was quoted $500 for each repair. I also had an issue with the automatic trunk not staying down. Thankfully my certified warranty covered these items. The car is truly a looker and I still get compliments. I have recently replaced the tires and it drives like new. I love this car.   Best car for the money I loved the A8 since the D3 model was first shown.  I waited patiently for the pricing to drop to a level I could afford (preowned).  I have had my CPO car for 4 months and 5K miles, and I still love it. It is not as reliable as my 98 Lexus GS400 which had almost nothing go wrong with it after 145K miles. I just had a number of things replaced at the 45K mile service, such as the trunk hinges (common problem), parktronic sensor, airbag sensor, and one softclose door sensor.  Even with these little problems, I love the car. No serious issue that will leave you stranded, but still something small that requires a trip to the dealer. I do not regret my choice, regardless. Happy Owner I purchased the A8 to replace a BMW 740I and never looked back. The fit and the finish as well as the ride comfort, overall performance, quiet ride and responsiveness of the A8 have made me happy for the last 31/2 years. After a couple of electronic issues in the first 3 months, I have simply changed the oil and replaced tires. I am ready to downsize to a smaller sedan and will make a beeline to my Audi dealer for the new A5.  Unbelievable car for the money Second owner purchase of a loaded 2005 A8 with the standard wheel base (not \"L\") and 37,000 miles. With the remaining factory warranty then Audi CPO warranty until 2011 combined with the features on this car (keyless entry, power trunk, XM, Parktronics, heated front/rear seats, nav, rain sensing wipers, etc. etc.) this car is an amazing value!  My A8 drives both like a sports car and a luxury ride (with the 19\" wheels) simultaneously.  And, with the attention to detail in the interior, it is hard to get out of the car after the trip is done!  Many similarities to the A6 that I traded, but you will quickly notice this is an entirely different car than the A6 platform.   Don\\'t buy the Audi I have owned the car for nearly 4 years. The electronics in car have been a mess. It has been in the shop over a dozen times and they still can not seem to get it right. Many of the problems are episodic and not constant.  At times, the lights will not go off unless you restart the car and drive it around for a few minutes before turning it off. At other times it will tell you a tire is low on air pressure when it is fine. I have given up on trying to get them to fix it and will be disposing of it for a Lexus. Don\\'t buy one.  They look great but the reliability is just not there. My Wife Will Miss Me I love my wife. I really do. I  try to miss her as I drive my A8 (that I just purchase 3 days ago). So far, no luck! This is an amazing car. Mine is black and loaded with every available option. 36k miles, lease turn in, certified w/ 6yr-100kmile warranty. Used is the way to go; especially if you aren\\'t completely sold on the new grille yet. I have owned a 1999 A8 and a 2001 A6 (for the aforementioned wife). Enjoying this one and looking forward to the next one.  Second owner We needed to replace a Volvo S90 and decided to try a used A8 after looking at the new models of Volvo, the Audi A6, and the 5 series BMW.  This A8 was a one owner with reasonable miles (40k).  It has been an impressive auto from performance to comfort.  The 19 inch wheels with low profile tires are great for handling, but with our non-aggressive driving, we will opt to go the the 17\" with A/S for lower noise and less road feel.  If buying used, be aware of the high cost to maintain, especially at the dealer.  Aftermarket parts are not much of a savings.  And all the bells and whistles could add to the cost of ownership due to maintenance. A8 L worst car ever owned! I cannot begin to list all the electrical issues I had with this car.  Beginning right after it was delivered.  Audi North America gave my wife and me a free weekend at a resort to compensate us for our troubles.  I got rid of this car and bought a Mercedes, which I had owned before.  Don\\'t let anyone tell you the A8 is as good as the S Class.  Simply not true, and Audi service stinks!  The final straw for me was when the MMI buttons all stuck and Audi refused to cover it under warranty - both the dealer and Audi North America accused me of spilling something on the console to cause the problem.  You will spend a lot of unpleasant time in the Audi dealer service department if you get an A8   Best Of Class The Audi A8L is the best \\'value for the dollar\\' vehicle on the road today. Hands down, no contest. Beautiful inside and out in a sophisticated kind of way. Elegant in presentation and powerful of stance. Handles better than any other car in its class. Rain, snow, whatever the weather, drive with complete confidence. Big and strong going down the highway. When those four rings appear quickly in your rearview mirror, MOVE!!! One problem after another From the first moment I got this car it has been in the shop. Over the past two years I have taken this car in 16 times. Problems include navigation inoperable, passenger window makes too much noise, trunk would not close properly, unless force was used. And the car died and would not start at all on one occasion and it was towed to Audi dealership. It took them three days to figure out the battery needed to be replaced. Very surprising that the battery needed to be replaced within the first year. The only good thing I have to report is that service has been accomodating and have provided loaners on every occasion.   Total Disaster We had 2 Audi A6s prior to this new A8L.  The A6s were great, so we thought the new A8L would be fabulous. Boy were we wrong.  The car has been in the shop 19 times in the last 22 months.  It spent the whole month of December 2006 in the shop with the MMI system.  It seems to have an electrical gremlin that appears every 2000 miles or 6 weeks, whichever comes first.  It has been towed to the dealship twice because it would not crank at all.  Audi A8 customer care has not been a big help either.  Without a doubt the worst car experience we have ever had. Outstanding  A8L This my second A8 experience. The first is a 2000 A8 that now has 122000 flawless miles. This is the reason that we purchased the 2005 A8L. Best vehicle that I have ever owned. Outstanding in ALL areas and a complete pleasure to drive. You can keep the BMWs and Mercs. No contest.  Audi understands and understates their cars. The car speaks for itself. It shouts \\'OUTSTANDING\\' as it passes everything on the road.  Finally a competitor to big Germans Gorgeous body, fit and finish. Impressive looks, great engine, agile, stately, big but easy to drive like a midsize sedan. Few flaws however: CD changer in the glove compartment must go, bad location for cup holders, short lived original equipment tires (Continental CH95), problems with automated trunk, immediately after purchase navigation upgrade was issued for $299 (should be covered at least for a year or upgraded with a discount). A luxury sedan wannabe I\\'ve had problems with this car ever since it was delivered. Immediately had a problem with the instrument cluster. Outside temp read below zero, so a/c would not work.  Transmission noise required 10 days in shop to fix.  Had several recalls. Now electronic controls (MMI) don\\'t work.  Although still under warranty, Audi wants me to pay, so they can pull and inspect unit before covering.  If you call their customer service center in Michigan, be prepared for a long wait before you can speak with an \"advocate\", and expect a poor result.  I\\'m buying a Lexus 460, and pity whoever buys my used Audi. Best sedan yet After 2 Mercedes, and 1 BMW I can easily say this is my favorite sedan I have owned.  After one year of ownership I can say that reliability has easily exceeded that of Mercedes with no issues to report.  It plays up to the \"driver\\'s car\" side of me without being as unforgiving as the BMW.  Fit, finish, and quality of interior matierials are remarkable.  Every car has quirks, but the quirks with this one are either petty or livable.  An outstanding automotive value. A8 L  Perfection Owned other luxury cars and there is NOTHING like my Audi.  I DEFINITELY will trade for another. My gas mileage exceeds 24 MPG on highway and 18 city. The highlight is Tiptronic transmission and all wheel drive. An absolute pleasure in the winter. Believe me the car doesn\\'t know the difference between summer driving and winter roads. Try one you will fall in love. audia8 An all round excellent vehicle.  All the safety & comfort features you could want built into a performance vehicle.  Quality craftsmanship & outstanding audi services.  If you\\'re looking for the safety & comfort of an S-class, but want the performance of a 700 series, then your only choice is an A8. Audi Satisfaction i leased my 05 A8 in December of 2004.  this is my first Audi.  so far my vehicle has been completely trouble free and a pleasure to own.  the attention to detail inside and out is amazing.  from the beautifully crafted interior to the exteriors crisp clean lines the A8 is visually satisfying from all angles.   the performance and handling  feel as though you are driving a much smaller vehicle.  i live in the northeast and had become accustomed to parking my car and using my SUV when the snow starts to fly.  not anymore.  the A8 has performed flawlessly in the snowy weather.  even with the original equipment all season tires you feel very confident driving on snow covered roads.    Audi A8L The Audi A8 l has been a pleasure to drive.  Great for long trips...perfect high way auto. WOW, what a car! I\\'ve had them all, Beemers Mercs, Lexus LS 430 and SC430\\'s, none come close. This is the finest of the big boys. Commodius, like a limo, drives and handles and fun with the triptonic. Eats up the miles and I have 7 speeding tickets to prove it (time for a radar detector). At 130 mph it\\'s like sitting in your living room and watching television in a very comfortable seat: If you try it, you\\'ll buy it!. No squeaks or rattles after 20,000 miles. What a car! Best money I ever spent on a car. The car is quiet - a great mobile office. But, with the optional paddle- shifters, it\\'s also like driving my S4 sport convertible, only heavier.  It corners, accelerates, and responds phenominally.   I\\'ve driven them all - this is the best interior, most luxurious, fun, responsive luxury sport-sedan in the $80-120K range.  Go for the paddles, the massage & ventilated seats, and the large multi-spoke wheels.  I love my black, but it\\'s sweet in the grays too.  Awesome in snow or on a sunny, winding road.  MMI computer system is easy to read. Bluetooth phone system is excellent.  Best $$$ I ever spent on a car! W12 my best yet Having had several nice cars, Citroen SM, 928, A4, I find this the best overall designed car yet. The MPG was expected to be low, but that comes with a car of this performance. The features are extensive and useful, especially the adjustable ride which reminds me of the SM. I give this car my highest overall rating ever. Converted from BMW 7 Owner to Audi 8L Had a hard time shifting our loyalty from BMW to any other German car.  The Audi 8L was purchased by a brother in law and he raved enough to make us take a look.  Fit and finish were outstanding and Audi\\'s version of the iDrive is superior.  Great sound, clean lines, and large comfortable interior.  Car is quiet, and sophisticated and dealer has been strong.  Full maintenance on warranty and All wheel drive = Great! Big Problems We have had continual problems with the computer and Advanced Keys.  The electricly operated trunk closed on my wife and hurt her, the HVAC is hard to control and does what it wants, the settings are nested inside the unit and are unsafe to operate while driving, the visibility to the rear required removing the rear headrest, the outward side visibility is poor as the mirrors are not wide enough and the pillar and seat back obscure side vision. The dealer cannot fix the problems and Audi has not \"escalated\" our complaints to where the regional or national reps will get involved.  We are tremendously unhappy and Audi has not helped. Love my car The A8 is simply the most wonderful car I\\'ve had in years. I had a 740i before, and I now have an A8L 4.2. It is so much more luxurious- I looked at the BMW and Benz, wasn\\'t particularly spurred, and looked at the Audi. I fell in love. It\\'s so beautiful, so understated, packed with coddling features (massaged seats, alcantara inserts, flip-panel NAV system), and it\\'s more than $3K less than the next cheapest (BMW). The stereo is amazing, and it drives better than my old BMW (an \\'01 model). Highly overated I have owned this car for almost 1 year. During that time the car has been back for repairs on numerous ocassions.The air conditioner is horrible. It takes 10 minutes on a hot day for the air to begin to cool off, until then a hot blower makes it feel worse. This is the same experience others with the same car say. The dealer says that \"everything checks out fine\". The car jumps when accelerating from a quick stop. The car has too many computers and there inherent glitches. The display pop up has been replaced, the center dash module replaced, and the navigational unit replaced. The car has a hard ride and is quite frankly overrated and poorly represented by their service people. Automotive Intelligence - The Audi A8  Just bought my Audi A8 two weeks ago.  It is the short wheel base version with the convienience package, the cold weather package, XM radio, Seat Ventilation & Massage, premium leather with sitching, and everything else that would normally be options, but come standard with Audi.  This is automotive engineering, design, and comfort at its absolute pinnacle. A8 This is my first Audi. I have one friend who has had his A8 for 7 years and loves it. I recently retired to FL where every trip on the interstate is an exercise in survival, so I was looking for a substantial machine with good handling. I\\'ve had my eye on the A8 ever since it was reviewed in Autoweek. I like brand consistency and the fact that the average Joe, me included, has trouble distinguishing an A4 from an A8. My previous car was a 2000 740 which served me well. Stylewise, the new 745 is too in your face for my taste.    Finally Fun and Toys in a Luxury Sedan I\\'ve owned Mercedes, BMW and Lexus sedans.  For my money, this is finally a large, luxury sedan that is fun to drive.  I\\'m also a toy fanatic.  The Audi has toys of value.  No electronics just to demonstrate that the engineers can achieve something.  This has toys that make sense! Impeccable interior and technology The moment I test drove the A8 I knew that it was a car that met our high standard of a sedan. We previously owned the S Class Mercedes and found that this car surpassed it in everyway. We enjoy driving the A8 and it is a  very comfortable car to drive. Passenger comfort superior in the spacious rear seats. A gem all the way! Best ever We own Mercedes S600 and 600 SL and rate the Audi superior to both. We will buy the new a8l w12 instead of the s6oo better finish, design and comfort. The heating and air conditioning is unbelievable. We have a total of 30 cars including Rolls Royce, Porsche, Ferrari and GM SUV and pick up but the Audi is the favorite of all. We purchased to take the place of the S600 in the winter when the S600 must be parked with snow on the road. We now find that we will opt to take the Audi as our car of choice. Best car I\\'ve owned This is easily my favorite owned car- beautiful from every angle, performance to beat sports coupes, luxury that would stun a king. I just smile every time I look back at the car, which is often. Incredible Machine This 05 A8L is my 5th Audi. Last was an 02 allroad. I cannot believe how incredible this car is. Stunning ride quality, acceleration, comfort and stability. Here in Colorado there is NO better choice in a luxury vehicle. Awesome traction in snow and total command in every imaginable driving situation. I am most impressed with how quiet the car is. And I do really love the drivers seat. Incredible amount of adjustments enable you to dial in a perfect fit and comfort level. But the rear seat guests have the best environment- better seats than most luxury autos provide for the driver. Stunning exterior styling and interior finish. This is a great driver\\'s car. Incredible Machine This 05 A8L is my 5th Audi. Last was an 02 allroad. I cannot believe how incredible this car is.

Techno The car has the style and luxury, of any other car. The exterior makes it look cheaper than it really is. The interior is very nice much like a mercedes-benz or better. Move over Mercedes-Benz Ok everyone. I\\'m not an employee of Audi, or anything like that. I just traded in my 2003 Mercedes-Benz E320 for the Audi A8L, and let me tell you that I will NEVER buy a Mercedes again. Its probably true that Audis don\\'t have the same \"chick factor\" as the Mercedes, but now that I\\'m married I guess that doesn\\'t matter anyway. This car is simply amazing. I enjoy driving to work now, and can honestly say that this car meets and exceeds all my demands. Nice Ride I ppgraded to my Audi A8 from an A6 (which I loved) The A8 gives me the extra room that I need without giving up a sporty ride. Audi sneaks under the radar so others do not see you as driving a snobby BMW or Mercedes-Benz. Best Road Car I Have Ever Owned My 2005 Audi A8 has every option available. It is a fun car, and I am proud to drive it in \"uppity\" Dallas. This is only my second day of ownership, but so far it has a very pleasant ride - quiet, stable, smooth, responsive. A cop stopped me and asked, \"Do you know how fast you were going in this 60 MPH zone?\" I said, \"No, officer, I hardly even know what kind of car I am in. I just bought it yesterday, and compared to my Honda Pilot SUV, it is a dream. I was just looking for the cruise control, hidden out of sight behing the spoke of the sport wood steering wheel, so I could hold this thing down to the speed limit.\" He said, \"Do you promise to go the speed limit?\" I said, \"Yes, of course.\" He said, \"Go on.\" A8L - L is for LUXURY The back seat also know as the \"living room\" has ROOM to really spread out. Most passengers are asleep within the forat 10 minutes of a drive. The lay out of the interior copmpartment is very refined- the suede headliner finishes it off in grand style. The handling far surpasses my 2002 A6 4.2, most likely due to the adaptive suspension.  BMW 745 to Audi A8L After owing Acura, Lexus, and most recently, a 2003 BMW 745I (Retail value UGLY) I purchased my 2005 Audi A8L. I\\'ve gone from the BMW I Drive (which I actually liked) to Audi M Drive which is somewhat easier to use. The GPS package is considerable better than the BMW but slightly poorer than the Lexus with its touch screen. The A8L has all of the power and zip that the BMW but is noticeably missing the constant mechanical and computer problems I became accustomed to in the BMW. The engine and transmission are flawless, smooth and quiet and the overall integrity of the interior, body fit and trim are excellent. I highly recommend this vehicle. Before you buy another Luxury car test drive this. Hamptons secret Best car to go to NYC and back to the Hamptons!  Fast, comfortable, very sweet ride, better than anything on the market, only one issue, why not sooner? BMW AND MB SIMPLY DONT GET IT! Simply put, the best money can buy at any price. I have owned 2 7\\'s and 1 S and now Two 8\\'s....by far, the best vehicles out there! love this car My previous car was a BMW 740il.  When the lease was up I  looked around , as I was not crazy for the 745.  Boy, am I glad I did!  The Audi is more quiet, responsive and comfortable for drivers and passengers. Everything You Would Want in a Car I did a lot of research and test drives before purchasing a 2005 Audi A8. I road tested a Mercedes-Benz E320, Jaguar S-Type, and was given a Jaguar XJ8 to try over a weekend. The Audi blew all of these away. I was on the Florida Turnpike in an absolute monsoon and the Audi never waivered. It stayed glued to the road. The car offers a luxurious ride with the handling of a much smaller car. Better than my Mercedes-Benz S500 My 2005 Audi A8L has been a dream to drive. I looked at it only after BMW desroyed their design and Mercedes-Benz started dropping on the quality ratings. This car drives as good or better than my Mercedes-Benz S500. If you\\'re looking for a great car Like many, I was initially concerned with Audi\\'s reliability after the acceleration issue back in the mid-80\\'s. After driving a Mercedes-Benz for the past seven years and spending too much time in loaner cars, I was particularly cautious. The jury may still out about the long term reliability (have only driven the car for six weeks), but I think my A8L is a winner. it has all the comforts of a high-end sedan, but with a fun, sporty attitude! The interior & exterior finish is superb and the car is a \"head turner\".  Awesome I have my 2005 Audi A8 for three weeks now. This is the best sedan you can buy at this moment. It will outperform BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and Lexus in every category.  It is gorgeous inside and out. It feels like a Bentley inside. Get the wooden steering wheel and pedal shifts. Amaretto/Sycamore is a gorgeous combination. The short base is long enough. This car has the best sound system available today. Driving this car you know and feel like you are the king! Best luxury vehicle I just recently purchased an Audi A8l after trading in my almost brand new Mercedes CLK 320.  The comfort and the drive is so beyond description.  Not one bit of sound in the pot holes of NJ. Love / Lust / Drive Having owned Audi, Mercedes, BMW and Range Rovers over the years...not to mention the occasional American SUV...I can honestly say that I\\'ve never had so much fun behind the wheel.  The A8L is like driving a Porsche Limousine.  Realizing that owning an \\'03 Range Rover in Florida was silly and unnecessary for my needs, I went in search of a sedan that would give me the same WOW factor.  Friends with 745iL weren\\'t quite satisfied; we have a MB S430 in the garage already and the Japanese cars just don\\'t do it for me.  Jag had low head room and seems to be for older folk.  Then, with the most stunning int/ext package I\\'ve ever seen, I saw her and bought her off the showroom floor. Bliss is mine! Sweet Ride My 2005 Audi A8 is a dream ride. It is smooth, powerful, and has great acceleration. The back seats have tons of room. The interior is exquisite. dont look any further I\\'ve had Porsches, Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.  Look no further than the 2005 Audi A8 for the best value for the money.  It has great handling, 4 wheel drive, and great comfort.  This car beats them all hands down. Don\\'t Look Any Further I\\'ve had Porsches, Mercedes-Bezes and BMWs.  Look no further than the Audi A8 for the best value for the money.  This car has great handling, a 4 wheel drive system and comfort.  This car beats them all hands down. Best So Far This is the best car I have ever driven for its type, having traded a Porsche 996 and Mercedes C320 for the Audi.  It\\'s a joy to drive and on long journeys its interior space and just plain comfort can\\'t be beat Never Again Thought I would get away from BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar this time out. Worse mistake I\\'ve ever made. Most items are terrific but this vehicle suffers from an inherent problem that Audi admits there is no fix for. It jerks forward from a stop on the slightest application of the accelerator. Get whiplash eveytime I leave a stop sign. They are all the same but owners will not admit it after spending this much. Takes 35 seconds to switch from FM to AM. No rear coat hanger. Interior light button tiny and buried among 6 other similar buttons on ceiling. Nav system poorly designed. Car has no sex appeal. I just bought wife new STS and aside from putting A8 to shame on all fronts, it gets WOWS everywhere. Better than Advertised The 2005 Audi A8 is silent, smooth, powerful, \\rsmart and handsome. OK, enough about me..:-)\\rWhat a car!   I just let my 2000 740iL go\\rand got an 05 A8L.  The 7-Series was a great car,\\rbut the A8 is even better. I cannot think of one\\rthing I don\\'t like about the car. Being\\rable to change suspensions and shift\\rpoints makes it like having two or three cars\\rall with the best interior in the world.\\rGet one! My Third Audi My \\'05 A8 is my third Audi. MY 2001 A8L runs \\rwith such zip and jetlike take off that it \\rit is without a doubt a magnificent  \\rvehicle. I prefer the A8 to the BMWs \\rbecause of the luxury feel that you get with, \\rcombined with the great speed.  A few things \\rto improve on include the cup holders and CD\\rlocation but overall this is a great car. So I \\rbought a new 2005 A8L this August and it it \\rblows away all the other top luxury \\rcars That I\\'ve road tested. Its handling on wet \\rpavement is all you can expect from any \\rcar that still rides on the ground. A smooth ride for the 2005 Audi A8L My 2005 Audi A8L drives like a dream. It is a substantial upgrade from my old Lexus in terms of its driving characteristics. The MMI was easy to use. I have nothing but good things to say about the car.  2005 A8L completely loaded $83900 MSRP The car is amazing and I got about $8k \\roff plus $750 for the Audi Family \\rDiscount plus one free payment of \\r$940.03 because I went to an touring \\rUS Audi event.   I sold another four \\rwhile I was there of the A8L\\'s and \\rA6\\'s.   Incredible discount and price -\\r can\\'t beat this car for the money - \\rand I have had over 10 5/7 series \\rBMW\\'s, the previous V8 in 1990 and \\rlater a mid-1990\\'s A8 and several M \\rcars from BMW and a S430 from Mercedes \\rfully loaded with a refrigerator. All I can say is....WOW! This car is fantastic!  Fast and fun to \\rdrive.  The MMI is so much easier to \\ruse than BMW\\'s.  My favorite part of \\rthe test drive was going to a wet, \\rempty parking lot and lowering the \\rsuspension to Dynamic and then letting \\rthis car work it\\'s magic! best rocket car This is absolutly the best car ever on \\rthe market. My wife does not get to \\rtouch it.  It is fast, responsive, and its design is \\rthe standard lost by BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\\rIt is the new gold standard, miles ahead of \\reverything out there. It has great power and \\rlines.  Just buy one, and you will feel that you\\'ve \\rfinally gotten what you paid for and then some. \\rIts architecture is stellar...do it. just do it If you are looking for a fun, luxurious, \\rperformance sedan , look no furthur. \\rI have had a number of luxury automobiles,\\rincluding the BMW 7-Series, the Mercedes-Benz\\rS500., and Lexus.  This is by-far the most \\rany car enthusiasts can ask for.  I traded in\\ra 2004 BMW 7-Series for it. JUST DO IT If not Perfection, damn close! The A8 \"Short\" model is absolutely \\rincredible. The interior absolutely \\rblows away any MB, BMW or any other \\rautomobile made - at any price... This \\rcar feels and drives like it made from \\ra solid billet block of aircraft \\raluminum.\\r Handling is suberb, with the wheel \\rallowing road feel to come right thru \\rto my hands without being loose. The \\rtracking of the car is like nothing \\relse I\\'ve ever driven. \\r Body and interior finish is exquisite. \\rThe Ameretto interior with the Maple \\rwood is an exquisite color combination.\\r You have three ride options that all \\rfeel tight and controlled. I leave it \\ron \"Auto\" and it works just fine.\\r The transmission is seamless and \\raccelerateion incredible. Some disappointments here...2004 model Fast, good looking sedan with plenty of room \\rinside. Good gas mileage, especially on highway.  \\rAnnoying nav system and MMI operation. Quirky \\rtransmission. worth it sleek on the outside and soft and \\rseemless on the inside.  handles great \\rand interior features are easy to use.  \\rdrives like you\\'re sitting on your \\rliving room couch with good pick up and \\rturns on a rail.  the only down side is \\ran obnoxious continous ringing noise \\rwhen the door is open and the key is \\rstill in the ignition (even when in \\rpark)and continous beeping when seat \\rbelt is not in use.  could use a couple \\rmore locations for service, but \\rotherwise, is spectacular.   My views on the Audi A8L During some minor bodywork, the battery \\rhad to be disconnected, after which the \\rMMI was inoperative. Now, I can\\'t use \\rthe sound system or nav system.  Local \\rAudi dealer could not restore MMI and \\rclaims he must order new nav system CD, \\rwhich I find difficult to believe.  I \\rlove this car but cannot understand why \\rAudi felt it necessary to incorporate \\rMMI which results in a simple operation \\rsuch as turning on radio or changing \\rtemp settings to a demanding task, \\rreqiring pulling off the road. The best out there !!! If you want to own the best all round Best car I\\'ve ever owned Leased a \\'05 A8L, Beige, Ameretto \\rinterior (special order). All the \\rgoodies except parktronic. Chose it \\rover s430, LS430, XJ8, and the 745. \\rAfter looking at them all it was an \\reasy decision.  Now that I\\'ve put 2500 \\rmile on the car a few observations.  \\rSmooth, fast, seems lighter that it \\ris, interior is exquisite, back seat \\rand trunk are enormous. Drivers seat \\ris the most comfortable seat I\\'ve ever \\rsat in. Love the XM radio. On-Star is \\rnice, just hope I never need it! Best \\rcar I\\'ve ever owned Awesome car This car is awesome. I like the every  audie a8l This is the most comfortible vehicel I \\rhave ever driven.The all whell drive \\rprovides great stability in wind, rain \\rand snow. The air ride is wonderful and \\rthe computer system provides you with \\rvaluable info.The front seat massage \\rkeeps you alert and relaxed when \\rdriving long distance.And the \\rincredible room in the back seat gives \\rgreat comfort to those passengers. Great car Great car, all features are great and a \\rblast to use! Sleeper Luxury Beats my Benz, Hands down, the best car \\rI\\'ve owned, Makes a new benchmark \\rstandard for 21st century cars,try it THE BEST  I think that this car surpasses any  The Best Ever The absolute best luxury sedan that I  A8 SWB Rocks Just took down a black on black \\'05 SWB A8 with \\rone-pay lease.  Car is truly amazing.  Spent a lot of \\rtime looking at the A8, Acura RL, Range Rover.  \\rTraded in a 330i, which I loved but was awful in the \\rsnow.   The A8 is the best looking car out there .  \\rNo mechanical problems (knock on wood), a \\rpleasure to drive.  Highly recommend to anyone \\rlooking for an understated but elegant car.    Driving Heaven We ba 2005 A8L and absolutley love\\rit!  It has the comfort and interior \\rclass of our former LS 430 but with \\reven more perks. We love \\rthe ONSTAR system with the phone \\rservice.  We don\\'t talk a lot on the \\rphone in the car, so the carry-over \\rminutes for up to a year make it a \\rconvenient option for us instead of \\rthe additional car phone and the \\rreception with the satellite phone in \\rphenomenal.  I have nothing bad to say \\rabout this car.  The back seat has so \\rmuch room for passengers that my 7\\' \\rtall son-in-law fits easily.  We have \\rhad no problems with the navigational \\rsystem or batteries as indicated by \\rother reviewers. The 2005 model has \\rapparently fixed those. Questioning Before I bought my A8L for my wife I \\rhad read nothing but good things about \\rit.  Now with 7 months of ownership \\rI\\'m questioning whether all that \\rpraise was just.  There is no denying \\rthe car\\'s excellent material quality, \\rbut the control layout is \\runergonomic.  Even worse, though, is \\rthat the exterior is plain and from \\rsome angles looks like my son\\'s \\rVolkswagen Passat.  My wife likes the \\rcar but prefers my MB S600.  The Audi \\rhas better handling than the S600, but \\rno where near the refinement.  I\\'ve \\rhad my MB for over a year and have not \\rhad a single problem, we\\'ve owned the \\rA8L 7 months and it\\'s been back to the \\rdealer three times.     GREAT CAR BUT PROBLEMS Car is great but the NAV & the radio  current leak from battery The battery has gone dead twice  and will go d\\read if the car is not driven daily. Charge will fall b\\ry 50% overnight. Has anyone else run into this p\\rroblem- so far not fixed by dealer. Any solution? u\\rsual mileage will be 15-20,000 per year abundance of luxury the best  ever.. no problems fast  Sporty Luxury and Great Gas Mileage This car is very quick and luxurious and for the price is a bargain (if that can be said for a car costing $90k plus.).  I average over 19 mpg around town and over25 on the highway.  It is not the sexyist looking but it is not a big feeling as the MB S class.  Like all luxury sedans it suffers great depreciation in the first two years as the market has moved towards SUV\\'s.  So lease and don\\'t buy as otherwise you are throwing money away. For the money Great car for the money. The last gen tech gets you a great deal off sticker. Great power, very comfortable, awesome engine.. One smooth car from look, to ride, and handling My A8 L is a 2017 3.0T Quattro Tiptronic with everything including the adaptive chassis and front power seats with massage. In other words, you really can\\'t beat this car for comfort. Even the controls are laid out in a configuration that makes sense, and with easy access so your fingers don\\'t fumble around when you want to reach out for something. The highest compliment I can give this car is that I actual enjoy being a passenger when my wife is driving. Not that my wife is a bad driver, but usually I am a horrible passenger. The ride is amazingly smooth and acceleration is close to driving a sports car. The safety features are amazing and should you be using lane assist, you will get an audible warning to tell you to put your hands back on the wheel. Some people aren\\'t fans of all the safety features but I am. Given the condition of roads and the amount of distracted drivers out there, I like feeling I might have an edge. The navigation system is excellent and it also provides you with traffic conditions and problems ahead. I did purchase extended warranties guaranteeing me bumper to bumper protection through 2023, including scratch protection. These automobiles are really comfortable computers on wheels and only a fool would fail to protect themselves in case a computer board or chip gets fried. My collision insurance took a slight jump as these wouldn\\'t be inexpensive cars to repair, but it wasn\\'t a bump such that it is highly noticeable; more like a hundred dollar jump. My wife has pretty much appropriated this car. She prefers the shift over the newer electronic shifter where you press \"P\" for park rather than actually move the shift into park. No doubt the 2018 model has upgraded but my wife is putting off the inevitable as long as she can.  Now, my wife isn\\'t a lead foot by any means, but she likes a car to jump when she hits the accelerator. She also appreciates the ease by which she can manuver.  We may keep this car for a couple of years. Understated Luxury and great value Beautiful body line. Comfortable and sporty ride. Great reliability. I owned it for seventeen years and never a problem. A very well made car. Of course, what would you expect from an Audi. Excellent car, but be warned.. I purchased my A8 used w/ 56K.  It handles wonderfully for a large sedan and I average about 17/25 on premium fuel.  I have found it to be both sophisticated and understated; and if you are looking for such a vehicle, it should be verboten for one not to at least consider the A8.  That being said, I have had reliability issues.  My thermostat had to be replaced, which required replacing the t and s belts, as well as the water pump, the CV boot tore causing my brake pad light to go off (?), my driver\\'s interior door handle randomly broke and my radio randomly died.  I have spent nearly $3,000 in the last yr. on this vehicle. Love at first drive What an awesome car.  After owning an Audi 5000, I never expected to buy another Audi, but renting an A4 in Europe convinced me that Audi has come a long way.  The first thing that attracted me to the A8 was the superbly understated styling. Once I drove it I was hooked! It is the finest car I have ever driven. It is luxurious in a subtle way which perfectly suits my style. I like that it is relatively scarce, but surprised it isn\\'t a bigger seller.  I especially like the light agile but confident feeling I get from this aluminum bodied all wheel driver. Audi A8 Best car I have ever driven. This car is glued to the road. Shines at speeds above 85 mph. Very comfortable long distace cruiser. Exceptional on slippery surfaces. Unbelieveably Bad Experience I\\'ve always loved the A8 and was pleased as punch when I finally found mine.  But I\\'ve had nothing but trouble from this car.  A year after purchase the \\'check engine\\' idiot light came high.  Audi diagnosed it as a bad tank of gas and reset it.  A few months later, same thing.  I wanted a true diagnosis.  $4300 in diagnostic fees later, it\\'s diagnosed as a broken valve spring requiring the heads be removed. Just this past week (May 2005) the steering started making noise. This diagnosis? An irreplaceable bearing in the electronic steering column -- the entire column needs to be replaced.  The cost?  Estimated at $2200.... Audi offered blue book on a trade, I declined. I\\'m turning Japanese. Drive of a lifetime I never owned a car like this but I couldn\\'t resist when I drove it. It feels as roomy as a Town Car but handles like a Porsche.  The only quibbles are the one small drink holder and the cheap plastic buttons to open the trunk and set the seat memory.  I will own this car forever if I can. Understated and Overlooked Great car (bought used with 33,000 \\rmiles). Dealer was fantastic. Only \\ritem I will be changing are the tires \\rwhich (Goodyear Eagles) are noisy. \\rCar is very classy but yet understated. Audi A8 -- great for mountain living Living in the mountains of Colorado, \\rwhere we contend with steep climbs and \\rsnowy weather, the Audi A8 is as good \\ras a sedan can get. It\\'s got the power, \\rtraction, looks, room and reliability \\rthat a top of the line luxury sedan \\rshould deliver.  This is a Great Automobile In the past 4 years I have owned the \\rMercedes S Class, Merceded AMG E-55, \\rLexus GS, BMW 7 Series, and a Toyota \\rLand Cruiser (which I still own and is \\rby far the best 4 wheel drive truck on \\rthe planet).  This Audi impresses me \\rwhen compared to the other vehicles I \\rhave owned.  The performance, handling, \\rand build quality are all excellent.  I \\reven like the understated design. Effortless grace -- and eat my dust too. It does what you want when you want it \\rwith effortless grace and composure.  \\rCommunicative under all circumstances. \\rHow can such a large car be so damn \\rgood, work so well, feel so good, catch \\rso many looks and gestures/comments of \\rappreciation -- it\\'s magical. Purchase off lease & happy I just purchased my A8 off lease. It is \\rby far the best luxury size car I\\'ve \\rever driven - Compared it to the BMW \\r740 an Mercedes. It has unbeliveable \\rgas mileage for a 310 hp V8, a subtle \\rbut nice interior, great acceleration, \\rgreat ride & handling and all time 4WD \\rfor those ski trips. The Bose sound \\rsystem is exceptional an the navigation \\rsystem is easy to use and accurate. The \\rexterior design is a bit conservative \\rbut I like the understated affluence. 2000 Audi A8 4.2 litre Quattro This car is like driving a Vault.  The \\rall Aluminum frame makes the car very \\rstrong and light.  The car is faster \\rthan it looks, easily doing 0-60 in \\rthe mid 6 second range.   The 4.2 \\rliter 40 Valve V8 cranks out 310 \\rhorses with more than adequate torque \\rto keep passengers heads planted \\rfirmly in the headrests.   I can\\'t \\rbelieve the Editor\\'s reviews on \\rperformance, with Quattro and this \\rmuch power, its easily the best \\rperforming luxury sedan currently on \\rthe market.  Its just one/tenth slower \\rfrom 0-60 than a comparable Mercedes \\rBenz, and faster than the BMW 740il.  \\rBut the Audi is Quattro, so in bad \\rweather, its the king of luxury \\rsedans.  High performance after market \\rtires are a must. \\r Germans Still Reign Supreme Wow what an engineering feat. Moving from a CTS6 Performance with it\\'s awesome chassis, the A8 outshines GM\\'s iron in virtually every category. But, to be fair, the A8 is $30k MORE so it should be better. This engine is magnificent, rocketing to 60 in 4.3 seconds. No matter where you are in the rev range, stomping on the gas just plants you back in the seat. 0-60; 40-80; 80-?? it does not matter this car is just Point and Shoot. The Dynamic Steering and Sports Differential give you a degree of confidence and road feedback unparalleled in cars this size.  The interior is better than MB or BMW.... coddling, expansive, top quality materials deftly blended to accent and compliment each other. The only negative to this car is the massive depreciation...so don\\'t buy new. My 2015 stickered near $100k and I paid less than $50k with only 18k miles a mere 6 months before it\\'s 4th birthday. CPO, baby!! Best in Class Audi\\'s flagship sets a high mark in the luxury sedan category.  I enjoy that it is less common than the other marks, but outperforms them in many aspects.  Even after three years, the model remains a head-turner and a true joy to drive on my daily 20-mile commute. Performance of the A8 4.0L T is robust, yet the look is understated. My only concerns relate to the inability of local dealerships to keep up with the service capacity demands as more Audis are sold.  Also, the unexpected service charge of more than $650 to align the adaptive cruise control should be covered in the pre-purchased Audi Care package.  On the whole, I am quite satisfied with what is my fifth A8. Thinking new car Best car I ever owned. My Favorite Car Ever This is by far my favorite car that I have ever owned.  It has everything that you could want.  I cannot imagine needing more power than what the A8  3.0 brings to table.  You tap on the accelerator and you\\'re off to the races with all of the horses you need under the hood.  The back seat comfortably seats people 6\\'5\", which is a rare find in any vehicle.  The seat massagers are a great feature for the driver and passengers and the climate control is excellent for front and back seats.  It has the smoothest ride of any car that I have ever been in.  There are roads that I regularly drive on that you have to take slow in my wife\\'s Toyota Sienna of you\\'ll get bumped around that I can drive over at normal speed and not even feel.  The camera that gives you a 360 degree view when you are parking or pulling out of a spot is a phenomenal feature.   It\\'s tough to live without when you\\'re driving a \"normal car\\'. I get 30 MPG on the highway, which is completely unexpected for this land yacht.  This is car is so luxurious that my wife tells me my expectations are too high when we look at other cars.  Once you drive this car, you\\'re going to have a tough time downgrading to another vehicle.  About the only complaint that i can come up with is the in-car wifi, which only has 3G capability and the navi system which is based on google maps which you have to have the 3G service for which is unfortunate, but I mostly use Waze for navigation anyway.  If you can afford it, don\\'t second guess - buy this awesome piece of engineering and luxury! 4.0L Daily Driver/Limo This is an exceptional car, one I look forward to owning for many years.  I purchased mine gently used (15k miles-strongly recommended given the depreciation)  from an Audi dealer  after 1 year of patient research.  I needed a daily driver (I was commuting 120 miles daily) with all wheel drive, good-great gas mileage and comfort. I landed a 2015, fully loaded 4.0L, after exclusively researching diesels, and I\\'ve not looked back.  Its extremely (almost scary) fast and nimble in Sport Mode and a world class, gas-sipping luxury saloon in Comfort Mode:  0-60 in 4 seconds (unreal power) or 30mpg on a gentle highway jaunt, the car has incredible range:  and although its fantastic to drive, riding in the back seat (with the Rear Seat Executive Package) is equally wonderful.   And I although some will say they disagree, I strongly recommend the Bang and Olufsen sound option:  just watch a few of the videos online about the perfectionistic development of the system, and listen to one against the other:  I\\'ve been grateful I held out until one came available.  I\\'d strongly recommend AudiCare (its a total bargain given the frequency and cost of services) and it transfers with the car, which I\\'d imagine increases residual value.  I could go on and on about all of the details which make the vehicle exceptional-  I\\'d just recommend you go drive one. Trade S7 for A8L Traded my S7 for this A8L. Love the seating for 5, the rear leg room and the overall quality of interior. The ride is superb. (10 months later) After driving the A8 for almost a year I\\'ve found it\\'s the best car we\\'ve owned. Better than our S7, A7, BMW 5\\'s and a 7. Comfort and ride are superb, as is rear seat leg room. I\\'ve had no mechanical problems while adding 18,000 miles over the past 10 months or so. I\\'ve had more powerful engines, but can\\'t see why I\\'d want more than the 3.0 for this car as it accelerates beautifully. what a great car love this car i trade my A7 for a A8 L and been the best decision you can make if you have kids. this would be our 3rd Audi and the most reliable car company we had own from range rover to Mercedes Benz. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR The A8L appears to be a great car.  But Audi is not telling its customers something very important.  If this car is in a wreck, it can take up to 3 months to repair.    I was in a rear end collision over 6 weeks ago.  The repair work has not even started.  The reason is that Audi limits collision repairs to one shop in any particular city.  I live in a city with 5 million people.  There is only one shop that can repair the vehicle and the shop has only one technician who is authorized to do the work.  As there are five other cars waiting to be repaired ahead of me, it will be at least another month before I may see the car back.  I filed a complaint with Audi, and they told me the reason for this insane policy is that the vehicle is aluminium and requires special training to repair.  With all due respect to Audi, there are many other cars made of aluminium and many other repair shops that can perform the repair.  So to make sure that these shops cannot do the repair, Audi will not sell them the parts. Audi refused to provide me with an alternative equivalent vehicle and refused to buy the car back.  It is insane to purchase a car which costs between $90 and $100k and for Audi to create a situation where it is impossible get it repaired in a reasonable period of time.  I will be commencing legal proceedings against Audi in the near future.  I will report back on the results. A Truly Fine Automobile We\\'ve owned luxury cars by Lexus, BMW, and Mercedes. After buying my first Audi, a 2016 A6 3.0 earlier in 2015, my wife was so impressed driving my car that she traded her Lexus RX350 in for a A8 L with the same spunky V6. I can\\'t help but to compare the drive, handling and ride quality of the A8L to a Lexus LS460L I traded for my A6 earlier this year. The Audi beats the Lexus hands down. This A8 L handles so securely for such a large car. The V6 is strong, and provides plenty of power. The car is hushed, substantial, has a huge back seat, yet handles like a smaller sedan. Technology is top notch, with the exception of no USB ports? What was Audi thinking? Otherwise, the navigation is quite good. Interior fit and finish is superb, with great feel at every touch. The massaging and ventilated seats are a nice touch as well. Fuel economy with the V6 is excellent, at 34 mpg in a 1000 mile trip at highway speeds in excess of 75 mph. A very comfortable long haul road car. Combined mpg has been a respectable 25 mpg. The LED interior lighting is subdued and well executed. The LED headlights are piercing the night driving. If these Audis hold up well, we are certainly going to continue to be Audi repeat buyers. More than I Expected... I have driven a Lexus for the past 16 years.  I have never has a bad experience, but wanted a change.  It has been two months and 4,000 miles.  The Audi has delivered in every way.  I loved the test drive, but find myself learning more about the car and feeling more at at home in the Audi every time I hit start...  I got a lot more than I expected.  There is a huge difference in Japanese vs German engineering.  Design, acceleration, handling, features, air ride suspension (wow!), and the way I fit in the adjustable seat.  The A8 offers subtle and spectacular at the same time.  Don\\'t buy a MB, BMW, or a Lexus without driving the Audi.  Definitely worth your consideration.... A 10 I had every top end car over the years & just got the Audi A8L 4.0 Engine this car is a beast.  Everything about this car is top end from the sound system to the seats & the ride.  I test drove the M/B-S & the B/M/W 750iL & went with the Audi A8L Dieselgate Audi The second generation V-6 TDI is a fabulous car.  Such a shame that VW/Audi felt they had to cheat on the emissions tests, because the repairs done to meet spec had virtually no impact on the car\\'s operation.  About all they did was set the shift points at a higher RPM.  But because of the cheating, diesel cars are probably dead in the US market.  One can make a good case that the emission standards are ridiculously high, but that\\'s not the point.  The problem is that VW/Audi cheated to get around them...and they wouldn\\'t have had to.  Because of all this, the value of these cars has fallen through the floor.  But if you can get one for a song, you won\\'t be disappointed.  The car has plenty of power, handles beautifully, rides very comfortably, and gets amazing fuel economy for its size.  I have easily hit mid-40 mpg on freeway trips (at least according to the computer).  The only thing that falls down is the navigation system.  The voice activation is poor.  It often can\\'t find a specific address.  It is slow.  Audi connect, which overlays Google Earth on the map, is a neat toy, but it is too expensive for what it is.  My other gripe is repair costs.  Once the warranty expires, this baby is going to be expensive.  It uses odd size tires...and goes through them quickly.  I think I paid about $1600 for a set of four new Michelins.  At least they are good tires.  The Pirellis that were original were horrible.  Very noisy.  And the brakes don\\'t last very long either.  New front pads and rotors at around 30K...one independent shop quoted $1200...got them done at another for around $800.  Can\\'t imagine what the dealer would get.  Dealer gets $100 for a set of wiper blades, for Pete\\'s sake.  Once the Audi Care expires, routine maintenance goes to an independent.  Dealer prices are beyond belief.  But the Audi A8 diesel is truly a great car, better than the several BMW and Mercedes I\\'ve had in the past.  No regrets whatever about buying this car! Fuel Sipper This is a great automobile.  The Lane control is excellent and the adaptive cruise works great in stop and go traffic.  The technology is almost to the point where one could read a book while traveling on the interstate.  I am getting over 40 mpg on the highway traveling at about 77 mph. excellent luxury sport car Impressive how it combines both luxury and sportiness . Far better than Mercedes and BMW , surprisingly Ballsy This is a very understated but elegant automobile. The A8 has acceleration on demand and handles like a much smaller vehicle. This is class! Great vehicle This vehicle is fantastic.  What more can you ask for in a vehicle. Still in Love over 1 year in I purchased my A8 late spring 2013 and have had no surprises, just pure driving pleasure. This change to Audi was driven by frustration of dealer practices to purchase a new Mercedes S-550/S350 Bluetec at that time a 2012/13 model. I was promised an excellent deal but after almost 4days of back/forth on price and frustration,I went looking for Audi and I\\'m very happy I did. The only reason for not leaving any sooner I had 4 new Benz\\'s within the last 6yrs from that dealership. Forget about loyalty.Love what you drive. I really do. This big girl has excellent dance moves..Rain or Shine, Curves or Straights it drives like a smaller car begging to show off. Both City/Hwy MPG is impressive. I still love my Audi A8..Im am almost 2 years in on my 2nd one a 2015 A8L..these cars are problem free and the Long wheelbase is just as enjoyable as the short. I really enjoyed my 2013, but my 2015 I love. I did look again at new 2014-15 Mercedes S550 but didn\\'t find enough merit to return to a Benz. It was nice but in my experience not better. I truly enjoy driving my Audi A8L.. What is really impressive is the truly satisfying ownership experience and the technology available for the price. If you find yourself looking for pleasure in your drive...Go experience a Audi for yourself.. I still love what I Drive... The biggest disappointment Ladies and Gentlemen,I am counting the days to return this leased vehicle and forget about this nightmare. I have experienced an array of problems during the last three years ranging from complete power steering replacement, faulty MMI unit, electric sunshades, tiers to excessive sticky brake residue., etc. The biggest problem are the tires. Audi created the unique size of the wheel for this vehicle (265/40/R20), which is only available from Pirelli tire manufacturer in all-season configuration. There are no other all-season tires available for this vehicle from any tire manufacturer in the world. Pirelli tires are extremely noisy from the beginning with horrible traction during wet and snowy weather and they last for only 20000 miles with very slow and conservative driving. After which the noise becomes unbearable. The biggest disappointment ever. Auto Mags are missing the boat WOW!!!Automobile, Road and Track, Car and Driver..you\\'re all missing something special by ignoring this beast.My previous were a GS400, BMW 545i, Panamera 4s (8cyl).I swear this car out accelerates the Porsche and handles better than the Lexus or Beemer w/sport pkg..This Audi accelerates so effortlessly and uneventful it almost scares me.A locomotive that Edmunds claims does 0-60mph on 4.2.After 2500 miles, I\\'m finally gettin the guts to push it around corners. It sticks like glue.However you\\'re so relaxed driving this vehicle it seems a shame to throw it around like the Porsche. Cmon car mags, spread the word.This beast is something very special. 2013 Audi A8 short wheel base I have only had the car for two weeks, so I can\\'t accuratelycomment on the reliability---but all other aspectsI rated as execllent, so I expect the relaibiilty to be the same. Anyway, I owned an Audi A4 which was very reliable. I understand I\\'m still on my \"honeymoon\" with this car, but so far it is great---I have owned: MB E320 and C280, Acura Legend and TLS, Lexus ES330, BMW 530i and 535i, Mazda Millenia and RX7, Honda Civic and Accord, and even a Triumph TR6---of course, any new car will have features unheard of a few years ago---but the A8 is everything the (just about unanimous) positive revews describe. Best Luxury Sedan Value This is my second audi,I upgraded my 2008 A6 to a 2010 A8. I also considered the BMW 550i GT and 7 series. I chose the Audi because it offered the best combo of luxury, performance and value. If you look at raw numbers of horse power and 0 to 60 times then the BMW shines, but if you drive the two cars there is no comparison. The Audi\\'s acceleration is like butter, the car seems to move effortlessly. I was always skeptical about whether or not the price jump from the A6 to the A8 was really worth it, but after driving both there is a big difference and I believe the cost is worth it. To be clear I am a fan of the A6, but I felt it was just a bit under powered with the 3.2 FSI engine.  Never ending money pit! Car literally has another issue everytime I take it on the road. I\\'ve owned many cars and this is by far the worse for reliability. The way to build all cars I had many VW products but Audi A8 is buy far the very best they made. I got mine with 55k andnowisat95k. Only maintain that I have done is brakes ,oil and battery but if anything else needed I would do as well. This car elevates the expiriance of driving and is a bond of class taste and karizma topped of with talent. And then there is a Quattro ..... LOVE IT love my A8L  Awesome Car  MPG or GPM????? 19 MPG advertised for City Driving but now with 2000 miles getting 10-12MPG. What a Scam!!!! Now see what VW has done with emissions . Did they do the same with MPG??????? 120K miles retrospective Finally retired my 8 a few months ago. Absolutely beautiful car. Loved driving it. And still miss it greatly. The expense of repairs quickly exceeded the residual value of the car. The car was very reliable and honestly the issues that I had with it were worn part maintenance issues. But items like the suspension repairs @110K for $7400. Other small issues for another $7500 soon followed. $15K for a car I then traded for $12K. But I did get a new S7 so obviously I still think they are great cars. Really had no problems at all until 100K. I don\\'t really think Audi\\'s are that expensive to maintain, either, nothing like Porsche or BMW in my experience.  40k-110k review Bought a preowned A8L \\'07 a couple of years ago. Have put 70K on car since. It has been remarkably reliable. The build quality is excellent. I don\\'t get the gas mileage it promised unless driving over 70. I have all service done at dealership, and have been very surprised at the low cost of maintenance, and the quality of service.Had a new A4 in \\'07, hated it, swore I\\'d never buy Audi again, got bad service.Bought the 8 because I needed big and 4WD.Expected many of the same problems I had with the 4, but it is a much better car. And I think Audi is a much better car maker and has made huge efforts to improve customer satisfaction. Truly fine automobile I bought my \\'07 A8L a year ago at Tyson\\'s Audi in Virginia.It had 61,000 miles on it and although it looked practically showroom new in every way, I was a bit worried about spending serious money on a 4-yr old car with that many miles.My worries have been laid to rest 20K miles later.I have owned 4 BMW\\'s (7, 5, and 3 Series) and one Benz.I never liked the Benz but loved all of my BMW\\'s and never thought I could appreciate a car more than a BMW.The 1st time I laid eyes on this car I fell in love with the looks.Mechanically, fit & finish and handling, this is the Ubermachine from Germany.Simple as that.No use enumerating it all.Enough said.I\\'m in love. $90,000 piece of junk I bought this CPO 2007 Audi A8L with 33,000 miles on it and have had nothing but headaches since owning it.   It has been in the shop 4 times in less than a year for numerous electrical problems.  The Audi A8 customer service line is a complete waste of time as they do nothing, but come up with excuse after excuse as to why the car is not performing as it should.  We have had 2 aluminum wheel failures where the tire immediately loses pressure.  One of these episodes almost caused my wife to be in a serious car crash on the highway.  Audi says it is still safe and I completely disagree.  I am now in the process of selling and getting a more reliable car (Mercedes or BMW) Audi A8 L  Luxury for Life Better than a Benz, BMW, Acura, Lexus for the L body style and large class of cars. Fantastic Car.. This car has it all.  Looks, performance and there are not many on the road. Every other car in LA is a  7 series or S550.  This is one amazing car. Tight , great motor, short wheelbase handles great. Bose stereo is more than adequate.  Best car I\\'ve ever had I\\'ve had the privilege of owning/leasing BMW\\'s ( 5 series ) a couple of 911\\'s and a Mercedes S class and I have to say that this A8 is tops for performance, class, reliability and most of all individuality. In LA there are thousands of S Class and 7 series. I can honestly say I\\'ve not seen one other dark blue short wheelbase A8 with the performance 20\" wheels in 3 years of driving here. The car is special in every way. The handling for a large sedan is spectacular due to the aluminum body and quattro. The fit and finish inside of the amaretto interior are awesome. Power is smooth and refined. Great Bose system. Biggest issue will be whether or not to buy it after the lease! Not one problem Best Luxury Value After selling my 06 A8L I realized what a wonderful car it was and found an 07 A8L with an MSRP of $90K, with 12k miles for $50K. New was out of the question due to initial loss. These cars are an absolute remarkable value (used). I don\\'t know how Audi is able to get the mileage out of a 4000+ lb. car with all wheel drive. Both comfort and performance are unsurpassed. B & O radio is a must . Rear seat leg room is better than a new Rolls- Royce Ghost @ $300K, and anyone who rides in it (who doesn\\'t know Audi) is amazed. All around best daily driver. The Audi A8 Sport is one of the most aesthetically pleasing cars I have ever seen.  The real surprise however is the combination of ride, quiet and predictable handling in all conditions with high limits for a vehicle of this size and class.  I expected competence, but I was surprised by the \"fun to drive\" aspects of this car.  The longer I have owned the vehicle, the better it gets. I drove the MB, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus - there was no question before I purchased the car which one I preferred - but I am even more convinced now that I have more than 14,000 miles on the vehicle and continue to explore its capabilities.  I hope Audi doesn\\'t change much before I am ready for my next one! 2007 Audi A8L 4.2L Quattro The A8 never fails to amaze us. On a recent vacation we drove 700 miles north and on the way the kids never asked \"Are we there yet?\" once. The car is so relaxing to travel in and makes any journey comfortable. The gas mileage is equally impressive, on our vacation we averaged 28 mpg and drove most of the way at 80 mph. The 350hp direct injection 4.2L V8 has immediate power and even more refinement. The MMI is easy to use and just makes sense. We looked at the Lexus LS460, but it felt big, heavy, and was worse to drive than the old LS430; the Lexus had too many features and had millions of buttons. The 2007 BMW 750i had the stupid I-drive and the S550 was too expensive. The A8 is brilliant.  Excellent car I\\'ve owned a 1979 5000S and a 2002 A4 1.8T, among other makes/models. This car is truly \"the ultimate driving machine\" bar none (sorry BMW). I\\'ve blown away many wanna-be\\'s in BMW\\'s from 3-series up to the 7-series on both highway and backroads with this baby and it\\'s never misbehaved or thrown me a surprise. Incredible power, positive steering, and an amazing ride. The perfect luxury car! This car represents the perfect blend between luxury accomodations and sporty performance. While other luxury cars (S550, BMW750 & lS460)seem to be good in some areas and weak in others, the A8 is excellent in every single area and weak in none. The ride is superb, design flawless and the handling is simply amazing, extremely nimble for a large car. The attention to detail is impeccable everywhere you look and the ergonomics is simply fantastic. The interior will put \"anything\" south of 200K to shame. These days I find myself running more errands. I wonder why.. 4th and best Audi My black on black A8L is built like a bank vault, is quiet except when accelerating, when it has a nice little throaty tone. I\\'ve had an A6 2.7 which was fun; still have an A6 4.2, (2002) which is still solid and fun to drive.  I had a 2006 A8L, which was great, but the 07 car is even better. It is understated, sumptuous, quick, and solid.  Everything one could want. Luxury without flaunting your wealth. I have owned Jags, Mercs, BMW, and Cadillacs and they all have their outstanding features. The regal look of the Jag, the comfort of the Merc and the Cadi\\'s smooth ride.  The Audi L W12 (my first) took the best features of luxury automobiles in its class and built a car that has lived up to my expectations.  Yes the car has a six figure price tag fully loaded; however the car delivers on all its promises and gives the driver a senseof  royalty without being to flashy.  Would it be fair to say that I am an Audi man for life?  YES!! A Great Car This is my third Audi, and I find them to be a superb balance between a luxury and sporty design philosophy. The vehicle feels like a smaller, more nimble vehicle, but has more room than practically anything else in this segment. The interior design and fit and finish are best in class. The S8 variant is an attractive alternative, but we also had a sporty car in the garage, and decided to go with the long wheel base and the extra rear leg room which precludes the S8 package. But, I also feel the extra length gives the car a more flowing appearance in the side view. Fuel economy is what you expect in this class, and when considering the performance (and the way I drive), it is rather good. Best luxury car for the money I looked at all the luxury models in this class, this car can\\'t be touched for the money you pay. It\\'s all I expected and more!  Perfect This car drives like a sports car and has the luxury you wish was in other sports cars. It has great speed and acceleration and can turn with ease. The leather seats are just fantastic for comfort. What can be finer? I love this car!  After driving a Jaguar for 3 years I was able to see the difference with my first test drive.  This car is wonderful.  The fit and finish is second to none.  The drive is terrific and the quality of the leather and wood cannot be matched, other then perhaps a Rolls Royce.  The power is great and the looks equate to understated elegence.  Every two or three years I purchase or lease a different type of luxury vehicle. I truly believe from now on I will always purchase an Audi.  It\\'s a great car! Excellent Touring Car The Audi A8L is the perfect vehicle for me.  I drive about 50k miles per year between North Carolina and northern VA/DC and it can get very tiring in the wrong kind of car.  The Audi is fun to drive and is very quiet and comfortable.  The quattro drive is great when there are some icy conditions on the VA highways.  The bluetooth connection with my phone works superbly and keeps my attention on the road while driving.  The rear camera and front and rear parking sensors are very handy when parking and backing out of crowded parking garages.  The rear seat area is very spacious and will seat 3.  The rear leg and shoulder room is unbelievable.  I can easily fit my 2 biggest clients back there. Three months with the 07 A8 I bought this car in October last year; after three months I have yet to find a thing that I don\\x92t like, it took me no time to get used to the mmi, and the voice command is very responsive. I got the black/ black in and out which shows the crafty, style and quality more apparent. I like the A8 that much\\x85 Now, I am dreaming the S8! Love this car! This car is beautiful, inside and out.  It feels classy rather than flashy.  We just had a major snowstorm here in Seattle and while everyone else, including lots of 4wd SUVs skidded off the road, I drove right home!   Great car Purchased in Sept 2006. Third Audi I\\'ve bought in past 4 years.  A6 2.7T and A6 4.2 and now this A8L. I still have the A6 4.2, which is 4 yrs old and in top shape with 54000 miles on it.  No problems.  The new A8 is rock solid, and just as peppy as the A6.  Interior is absolutely top quality.  MMI is a bit daunting for me, but I am working through it.  (Never had one before.) I think the side mirrors could be a bit larger, but I love everything else, including the massage seats and front and back \"radar\" for parking.  I will buy another in 3 or 4 years. THE BEST EVER! I just picked up my A8L 4.2 V8 2 weeks ago and it is THE most luxurious car I\\'ve ever owned.  The attention to detail of the interior leather and wood is sheer perfection.  The drive is amazingly smooth but as precise as a surgeons scalpel. I can\\'t believe that a large luxury car like this handles so well.  Not to mention the all wheel drive gives me a feeling of confidence on the road that is a true benefit. Mine is Black with Amaretto Leather and the B & O stereo!  The rear seat room is amazing and my girls love the power rear seats! Bellisimo! The most beautiful car I\\'ve ever owned. Stunningly luxurious interior, classy exterior, polished demeanor, great acceleration from 350hp V8, dazzling 19\" wheels that turn heads, super attention to detail, nimble handling that belies its size, and so much more.  I bought it last week, and already took it across the state line! Sporty A8 I purchased my A8 on 11/04/06.  This is not the long wheelbase model but the shorter A8.  If my dealer told me the truth this the only A8 in the Audi Central Region with the 20\" Sport Package.  The car is not only a knock out in looks but a blast to drive.  Great performance plus all the luxury you could ever want.  I traded in a 2006 Infiniti M45 Sport so you know I had to go some to find a better vehicle!  Audi needs to advertise this model more. Your luxury car has arrived This car is what luxury cars are all about. The interior fit/finish is second to no car on earth. The exterior design is flawless, even the grille is growing on me. The incredible power of the W-12 powertrain is nothing short of amazing. The ride and handling balance is perhaps best in class. I absolutely love it. Best car I ever owned! Drive it before the competition fine Machine Vehicle rode very well - Has unbelievable performance w/4.0L V-8 - Absolutely NO evidence of bear-tracking no matter hard I pushed it. Road noise via tires was a bit more than the S550 & the dash was nice but not as plush or expensive looking - Actually the whole car, exterior & exterior was not as \\'expensive looking as a S550 but very clean & soft lines. Trunk room is awful small for a \\'L\\' luxury car & roof is somewhat low for a vehicle in this class. In spite of a few cons as listed here, this is a very, very nice vehicle & I will likely purchase one if I can get the right deal. According to the dealer, repair can be an expensive & long ordeal due to the amount aluminum used in the body & frame. A8 Grade A+  It Beats All of Them If you want a 4-door sedan that drives, handles and accelerates fantastically you need to buy an Audi A8L.  I have had numerous Mercedes, BMW and Porsche vehicles and this car tops them all.  It is a stealth vehicle that doesn\\'t stand out with chrome, radical styling, \\'look at me, I\\'m expensive\\' statements.  It just quietly goes about its job of getting you where you want to go in comfort with all the power you can handle at your right foot.  Great seat comfort, quiet interior, all  you could want for a long drive in heavy Southern California traffic.  I am totally satisfied!I now have 17,300 miles on the car.  No problems and amazingly not one rattle in the car.  I am still totally satisfied.In February, 2018 it now has 21,200 miles on the odometer.  I\\'m returning to the Audi store in Riverside, CA on Monday for the 20,000 mile service as the car is two years old.  To date there have been absolutely no problems with the vehicle.  Even the Dunlop ultra high performance tires still have more than 10,000 miles of life.  I am totally satisfied with nothing but praise for the Audi. Heartache/headache This car is so comfortable we call it the sofa. It has,however, been a maintenance nightmare. It is constantly in the shop and dealers in northern Californiauniformly provide lousy but expensive service.When the heater failed while in Minnesota on awinter trip, the dealer groaned when he saw it was a 2004.Nothing but headaches, he told me.Tons of electrical problems to start with, then the list gets mechanical. A lot of car for the money, great value  About 3 months ago I bought a 2004 A8L with 70K miles (black on beige) for $16K. I gave my BMW 530i in trade. At the beginning I missed the sportiness of the Bimmer but after a while I got used to it. Considering the fact that the car is a lot bigger and heavier than the Bimmer it is understandable that it doesn\\x92t sprint. My A8L has lots of gadgets that my Bimmer did not have. A few days ago I put 19 inch OEM wheels + new summer tires on it, man, it rocks now. I used to be a Bimmer fanatic and was looking for a 750Li for a while but after driving this car I am reconsidering. So far knock on wood have not had any mechanical issues with it. It is a lot of car for the money and very much fun to Expensive Unreliability We expected Audi quality and attn to customer service when we purchased this vehicle. Our experience has been terrible. Mechanical car repairs since 80,000KM  have exceeded $7,500. Examples of necessary repairs are, replacing starter cost $992.16, dysfunctional remote which has had batteries replaced 5 times. Four upper control link bushings cost $1130.53, breather valve atop manifold cost $240.81. Decarbonization of air intake system cost $216.57. And the car stopped functioning on HWY 81 last night requiring towing, stranding us in Wilkes Barre, Penn and now requiring replacement of the mass air flow sensor cost unknown. It apparently was also misfiring on some cylinders. Love Hate Relationship Most of the reliability issues owners have experienced are electronic problems. Interestingly, I have had major mechanical issues - transmission, suspension, cooling system and more. All these problems started right around 51K miles, just out of warranty! So far I have spent over $6,000 in repairs. About $4,500 of that is parts, because you won\\'t find aftermarket parts for this car. If you are reading this review you are probably considering purchasing a used 2004. My best advice would be to get the best extended warranty you can. Get a warranty that has \"stated exclusions\" only, so you know exactly what will not be covered. With all that said, I really do love driving the car! Great car but... I traded a 2001 BMW 740iL for the A8L.  The car seems great but less than 3 weeks after I bought it, it was in the shop for a system failure and the entire dashboard display has to be replaced plus several other items.  Check the service history. I was told by the tech that the \\'04s are \"just temperamental\".  If you can, hold out for a 2006/07  Get a CPO and still under Audi warranty or you will be in big trouble.  Gas mileage seem very poor. Just a great car A dream car.  Excellent pick up, great MMI, really simple to use, very few steps to do anything important (i.e. radio, heated seats etc.).  Spacious like you wouldn\\'t believe.  Great handling, fun to drive.  Highly recommended, but you do have to expect issues when you buy German.  Great car, but... This is a great car, but you will get to know the service manager on a first name basis.  An extended service policy is a must or you will go broke.  A dream car to drive on long or short trips.  I will purchase another A8L when my extended service policy runs out. If only it had two batteries The Audi A8L is both an engineering triumph and a nightmare. It is the best riding, best handling, most responsive car I\\'ve ever driven in a long series of BMW-7, Jaguar XK, MB S-Class and other assorted vehicles I\\'ve owned. It even gets remarkably good gas mileage (25 mpg on the highway at 72 mph) thanks to its aluminum body and consequent light weight. What\\'s the catch? It\\'s had to be flat-bedded to the dealer twice with a dead battery. The battery can\\'t be charged, can\\'t be installed outside a dealer who mates it to the car via computer. Seems its electronics are so complex that the engineers wanted to give it a 24-volt system, but the marketers said \"no.\" The engineers were right. A8L will always be my only car I purchased my 2004 A8L after owning a 1999 model. This car is a major advancement over the previous generation car which was a great car in its own right. It is a technological wonder mechanically and the interior is darn near a work of art. The structure is rock solid with no body flex and the suspension is a perfect balance of comfort and handling. The engine has excellent power and smoothness yet sounds like a performance car when pushed hard. This is the most intelligently designed car in the world according the to the window sticker and I couldn\\'t agree more. As long as Audi continues to build this model I will own one. \" I absolutely LOVE my car \" This car was the gift from a lifetime of hard work to myself.  It is a mechanical masterpiece, gorgeous and so comfortable. I live in my car, so it was important to have one that was spectacular inside as well as out. 2 notes, the Onstar system included saved my life in November, 2005, literally. I went into anaphylactic shock while driving, they were spectacular...every car should have this without exception. Second, I park in valet every week wherever my travels take me and without exception, a comment is made from them about how beautiful this car is... I take that as a great compliment to me and the car! Thank you for my \"Lilly\". I think the Quality of the w12 is better I have a 12 cylinder A8 and i love it.  It beats my 760li, S65 AMG and my M5.  All the problems listed below are probably only with the 8 cylinder.  Audi Probably decided to make the w12 better mecanicly to help boost sales on it.  I have barly driven my 3 other sedans ever since i got this car, Ive barly drivin my Aston Martin convertable.  If you want a powerful, fast, brand name luxery car.  Tou can not go wrong with this car.  In my 7 months of owning it I haven\\'t had one pronlem. A Bonza Beauty Mate Some problems with the trunk electric motor which was replaced but still a little sticky Sometimes the lights stay on when the car is not locked and drains the battery. Also Tire pressure feature on Dash screen always seems to register the same pressure even after you inflate tires more. Otherwise an absolute gem handles so well, loves fast corners, room for a party in the back seats, great handling, like a rocket in Sports drive. Just watch the curb parking when the suspension is set low as you will always hit the curb when parking nose first against even the lowest of curbs....just reset suspension to lift, wait a few seconds and you clear most of them.Service has been excellent A pleasure to drive, nightmare to own This is a beautiful car and a sheer joy to drive and ride in -- but you don\\'t want to own one! (unless you REALLY like visiting your dealer) This is my 8th Audi -- and my last.  It spent over three months in the shop in the first year.  Alarm system, MMI, running down the battery, trunk closer bent the trunk lid (Audi said it couldn\\'t happen and wouldn\\'t replace), starter module, air bags failed (twice), transmission. Audi wouldn\\'t own up to any problems...until it died on the dealership floor.  They had a fix for a problem that doesn\\'t exist, but it didn\\'t work. Won\\'t take the car back (it\\'s \"cheaper for them to keep fixing it.\") Three trips to dealer this month.  Sound like fun????   Disappointed First car was taken back by dealership after electronics failed and car had been in the shop for 30 days. Replacement vehicle still has electronic problems. I have been locked out (remote will not work) and the automatic rear lid closer works only on occassion. MMI has been upgraded but is tempermental and is difficult to work while driving. More distracting than a cell phone!. Dealer service is terrible, given the cost of this \"luxury \" vehicle. I\\'ve had better service at a Chevy dealership. The new Luxury Benchmark!!! My A8 by far recalibrates the benchmark for sedans in this segment. It is the perfect blend of performance, class, beauty, character and understated elegance. The interior finish and little touches all over the cabin demonstrate the incredible attention to detail that BMW or Mercedes can\\'t even begin to dream off.  With Quattro, excellent handling, and completely effortless highway cruising, driving an A8 can only be described as a highly rewarding experience.                   Best car Ever! Love this car...never owned anything better. This one puts Mercedes and BMW to shame! Overall, I have never been happier with any other car. Usually buy 2 cars per year; one luxury car and one sports car. I have kept this one longer than any other one. Go Audi!!!!! Love my new A8L My 2004 Audi A8L is an outstanding sports sedan. I love the quattro in the rain. It is an outstanding highway cruiser.  There is limo-like room in the back. It has a Mind of its Own My 2004 Audi A8 is equipped with all the electronics, short of making you coffee in the morning. The only problem seems to be that it will work when it feels like it.  I have had the vehicle back for the upgrading of the navigation system. The following are a short list of poroblems that I have experienced with this car: the auto trunk open/close is not working; the car will lock itself; the seats do not adjust to the entry key being used; the interior lights will not work in the auto position (they just stay on); the doors will not open with the remote key all the time; the seats seem to adjust by themselves. Great Car, Poor Service My 2004 A8 is my first Audi. It is one of the best cars that I\\'ve ever owned. It has great power and a great ride even with the 19\" wheels.  It looks great with an understated elegance. It is a true pleasure to drive. My dealership\\'s customer service is awful though. It is too bad that such a great car can be ruined by such poor service. This will be my last Audi! NYTimes A8L Opinion This is an awsome car from every aspect.\\rThe engine is fearsome, the exterior\\rwonderful and the interior handsome\\rbeyond compare. The ride is akin to\\rgoing down the road in your living room\\rwith total feel of the road. The only\\rdrawback is the police that find your\\rcontrol outside of their interpretation\\rof the law. The controls are all so easy\\rto understand and use I can\\'t conceive\\rof preferring the complicated BMW or\\rMercedes. In a nutshell it is fantastic! Great Car Bad Company A great car which deserves a company to \\rstand behind it.  The car spent a total \\rof two months in for service, with the \\rlast one being 45 dyas in a row.  The \\rcar has computer and transmission \\rproblems which Audi will not stand \\rbehind.  It was a bad experience.  the \\rtransmission slips and progressively \\rgets worse. Terrible surprise Initially loved the car, until I went \\rfor a car wash and the trunk lid \\ropened by itself...everything got wet \\rin the trunk. How this kind of thing \\rcan happen in a luxury car???\\r Then I went to the dealer and \\rsupposedly they changed the motor of \\rthe trunk lid. I also changed the \\rtires to all season for the winter \\r(got unfortunatedly the 19\\'\\' wheels \\rwith summer tires). The dealer messed \\rup the tires and wheels (with quite a \\rfew scraches). Also they used the car \\rfor ~ 60 miles (probably the \\rtechnician took for a ride). This is \\runacceptable from a luxury car \\rdealership.  \\r Like it alot After 1200 miles, still honeymooning, I \\rhave had zero initial problems. I chose \\rthe Audi after considering the 745, \\rLexus LS 430, and believe it or not, \\rthe X5 and Toureg. The 745 was closest \\rbut after really working at it, I \\rremained confounded by the BMW iDrive \\rsystem. I am a technology geek and this \\rwas over the edge. The MMI interface on \\rthe Audi is much more intuitive, but \\ryou do have to be a person willing to \\rlive with it for a week of daily use \\runtil you get the knack of it. The LS \\r430 was too stodgy looking, the X5 \\rinterior kludgy, and the Toureg was too \\rfunny looking for my taste. So, the A8L \\rit was, and man am I happy about it. Audi just misses... This is a great care to look at and it can be fun \\rto drive.  Unfortunately, Audi never got the \\rtransmission down.  If you don\\'t mind an \\runpleasant surge as you commence to \\raccelerate from a stop, you will be happy.  It \\rdrives me nuts.  Also, don\\'t buy the 19\" wheel \\rversion as the ride quality tradeoff is drastic.  \\rAudi advertises as the \"Intelligent car\" but the \\rnav system is difficult to operate and that pop \\rup screen to control the radio sucks. The Standard of Luxury and Refinement This the best luxury sedan bar none! I \\rhave owned MB, BMW (my last car that I \\rcouldn\\'t wait to dump with all its \\rproblems), and even an old Jaguar. The \\rdesign, style, quality, luxury, and \\rperformance spell nothing but \\rrefinement. After buying this vehicle, \\rI studied Audi\\'s history to know more \\rabout its past and now I know that the \\rA8L lives up to Audi\\'s grand heritage \\rand sporting  history. Audi has one of \\rthe richest histories of any marquee. A \\rtrue marquee. Not a marketing gimmick \\rlike a Lexus.  True to its Grand Heritage This is the best vehicle I have owned \\rand the best Audi I have ever owned. My \\rS4 comes very close, but it is a \\rdifferent kind of car, so one cannot \\rcompare. It is simply superb and \\rbeautiful. It reminds me of the great \\rAudi Horches from the early 20th \\rcentury that were the epitomy of grand \\rtouring and luxury in their day in \\rEurope. This is grand touring vehicle \\rrich in Audi\\'s heritage both past and \\rpresent. Problems already? Lets see, I have only 400 miles on my A8L and it \\rhas spent 4 days in the shop because the MMI \\rsystem locks up or just will not start. I really hope \\rthis is not an indicator of things to come. I had to \\rget rid of a 745i for similar iDrive errors and \\rrecalls. Audi needs to nip this in the bud quickly \\rbefore they end up buying back all of their first year \\rmodels. One great automobile This automobile is the finest vehicle \\rthat I have ever owned. I have not had \\rto return to the dealer once for \\rwarranty work, only for the five \\rthousand mile service. The fit and \\rfinish is exceptional.   Fun to drive, but rotten electronics The car drives well(but not as well as \\rthe 740iL it replaced) but the \\relectronics are a horror. To tune the \\rradio the driver needs to take his eyes \\roff the road. About half the time the \\rright outside mirror doesnt return to \\rnormal position after reversing.The MMI \\rscreen comes up blank if its been closed \\rbefore, and needs to be opened, closed \\rand opened again to work.After 2 months, \\rsomething drained the battery and the \\rcar had to be towed to the dealer. Should have bought a Mercedez I bought a brand new car and within  Surprisingly good - eats country roads  Picked up new 2004 A8L recently - with \\rtrepidation after reading about \\rproblems/bad reviews surrounding \\racceleration, brakes, and electrical \\r(battery life) systems. After 200 mile \\rrun - absolutely no problems - nada. A \\rreal all around pleasure - from both \\rcomfort and fun to drive perspectives. \\rActually this is the real luxury \\ralternative to a SUV - lots or room, \\r4wheelDrive, trunk space forever, and \\radj. air suspension. My 14 year old \\rdaughter in the back-seat loves it. A \\rhuge move up from my 2001 BMW 330ci. \\rAnd big brother to my Jeep Cherokee \\rOverland. Sullo Family A8 It\\'s just what I expected it to be.  My  Nothing but the best The quality is impeccable. The drive is \\rexceptional. Ride is the best ever. \\rPlenty of power. And it is RARE \\rcompared to S, E class or 7 series. \\rEveryone loves to look at it. Five \\rgolfers and five bags in the trunk \\rtravel in style. Rear seat is a lemo \\rclass. Shortcomings: Driver\\'s seat \\rbolsters are a little tight, and no \\rsatellite radio available when I \\rpurchased. Gas mileage is about 12-15, \\r25 at 80 mph on the highway. Love it.  Fix the MMI MMI has constantly failed, including \\rrunning down the battery forcing a tow \\rjob. Dealership can\\'t fix and blames \\rAudi USA. This is a very serious \\rproblem that they need to come clean \\ron. Credibility is vanishing! Electrical Malfunction Otherwise stellar car spoiled by   NICE RIDE!!! very very nice ride frustrated I couldn\\'t be more frustrated.  I\\'ve had it in  almost love it It drives beautifully. I have had \\rmercedes, lexus and BMW, and this car \\rdrives better than all of them. \\rHowever, the attention to simple \\rconveniences is not there. For example, \\rGood luck finding a water bottle that \\rwill not fall over in the front cup \\rholders. Also there is only a 6 CD \\rchanger. No additional single CD \\rchanger (as in the BMW) nor a tape \\rdeck. This means that you cannot switch \\rbetween sources without losing your \\rplace. So while the car is a pleasure \\rto drive, it does not take care of some \\rof the simple things that you should \\rnever notice. The New 8...  Beautiful car that is so good that it\\'s \\rfaults stand out more than they \\rotherwise would.  I love a big ride, \\rbut this one is so large that \\rParktronic should be standard... almost \\rimpossible to park in tight quarters \\rwithout it (or without playing bumper \\rcars).  DO NOT BUY WITHOUT IT, despite \\rits over-sensativity or your assumption \\rthat you can park a car without a \\rcomputer (that\\'s me!) Just got better Great car! Great Car very good, not great handles beautifully, but with a couple \\rof minor annoyances---shifting from \\rfirst to second can be a bit jerky on \\roccasion, and speedometer consistently \\roverregisters by a little over 5 %\\r(odometer also overregisters, by 1--2%). Some Good..Some Not So Good I drove everything in the class; Q45, \\rVery solid feel to the car. Have not \\rhad the need to truly work out the \\rQuattro but it is nice to know it is \\r745,S500,LS430,XJR and the A8L won out \\rwith combination of performance, looks, \\rroominess and value for the dollar. \\rThe 4 year maintenance included helped \\rmake the decision as well.\\r My vehicle was ordered with \\rconvenience, cold weather, parktronic \\r(a must)and 19\" wheels. Much has been \\rmade of the harsh ride with the 19\" \\rwheels. I have not experienced a \\rproblem. Given their excellent look, I \\rcan deal with any minor lack of ride \\rcomfort.\\r  audi 8L-mixed bag This my first Audi, I have previously  \\rdriven other high end sedans and sport \\rcars. The beautiful interior, \\respecially the dash was the best \\rselling point. The car has great \\rpower, handling and braking. I have \\rhad a number of serious technical \\rproblems. The first was being locked \\rout of the car, with only 500 miles, a \\rnon operatin heated steering wheel, \\rand most importantly a less than \\rcomplete NAV system. The NAV system \\roccasionally takes me to the right \\raddress in the wrong town. It also \\rfails to give complete numerical \\raddresses. Audi does not seem to have \\ra fix for this problem.  Wow, what a car! So far this car is outstanding, the \\rcomfort, the performance and the look.  \\rthis sedan is big, a lot of leg room in \\rthis vehicle.  the truck is huge, i can \\rplace 4 golf bags and still have room \\rfor luggage.    beyond expectation A very smooth and more comfortable ride  One fine automobile this is truly a fine automobile. i have  Best is yet to come has arrived! Clean, no frills style. The 19\" inch rims are \\rexquisite. The finish and detail are perfection. The \\rease of use of the \"knob\" makes using all of the \\rresources this car has available a joy to use. The \\rnavigation system and mapping are easy to use and \\rfigure out. The engine and transmission are a rush \\rto push, the 6 speed makes this car feel like \\rsomething much smaller. I can\\'t wait to drive the \\rV12 and the S8. Best Luxury Car on the Market oday From the moment you get behind the \\rwheel of this Euro Luxury Sedan you \\rnever want to put yourself in another \\rJapanese knockoff.  Even th Q45 which \\rhas been trying to copy Audi for ears \\rcan\\'t match this all Aluminum ( I mean \\rreally \"all aluminum\" not the fake \\rJaquar aluminum )for it\\'s rideability, \\rhandling and overall owner experience.\\r Wow... Audi A8L is equal or better than others I was considering an S500 Mercedes and  early problems In the 10 weeks i\\'ve owned the car, my \\rremote controls have died out three \\rtimes.  The dealership keeps fixing it \\rand it dies out again,  So far the \\rdealership cannot figure it out.  The \\rservice is nothing like the great \\rexperienve I\\'ve had with Lexus. Good Techology, terrible phone system I immediately recognized the \\rtechnology advances over BMW and \\rMercedes. Buyers need to beware of \\rMotorola V60 phone functionality. It \\rdoes not work with the onboard MMI \\rsystem and is basically a glorified \\rhands free kit (effectively USD 1,000) \\rfor no added value. Voice activation is \\rapproximate at best and does not work \\rwhen raining \\rSuprisingly, none of the professional \\rreviewers noticed that the phone system \\ris archaic and a real problem. The \\rMercedes S class do have numbers that \\rupload to the onboard computer. Another \\rissue to be careful with is the choice \\rof wheel rims. I have the 19\" with \\rsport tires which account for a very \\rbumpy ride.  AWD ultimate sports sedan excellent power and handling. great interior  Exceptional Luxury Sedan Audi not only goes head-to-head with \\rthe S-Class Mercedes and the BMW 7 \\rSeries, but raises the bar on what a \\rluxury sedan is in terms of value for \\rmoney, aesthetic pleasure, performance \\rhandling, reliability, SAFETY, and all \\raround \"feel good\". This is one \\rseriously exceptionally engineered \\rhandling automobile. It is a welcome \\raddition and partner to my existing E-\\rClass Mercedes and Porsche Boxster S. \\rI would recommend the A8 to anyone who \\ris looking for the benefits of a \\rluxury sedan without forfeiting the \\rpleasures of a high-performance sports \\rcar. WOW! This car is unbelievable! The exterior \\rstyling, interior layout/finish and \\rperformance are all best in the class. \\rThe sound system is best I\\'ve ever \\rheard, there is room for days in the \\rfront, back and trunk, and for a car \\rit\\'s size, it handles better and is \\rmore responsive than the Porsche I \\rtraded in. I looked at the 7-Series and \\rthe S-Class and neither compared! Buy \\rthe Audi! More than expected by hot car lover. My A9L is a dream come true. Makes BMW \\rand MB look last generation. More fun \\rto drive than a Turbo Cayenne, and more \\rrare. Interior details are stunning. \\rLighting is knockout. Stereo is \\rwonderful. Back seat is almost limo.  I \\rdrove one of the first TT coupes in \\rFlorida. People crossed 4 lanes of \\rtraffic to oogle it. This car is just \\ras stunning. Even my teenage son and \\rhis friends are impressed. It must be \\rcool. And there is room for 4 bags and \\r4 golfers in style. Audi quality and \\rservice are wonderful. My dealer, \\rShelton, is A1. I hate to gush, but it \\ris one ego trip for a person who loves \\rto drive.    Audi A8L Intuitive Software for navagation  best I ever owned I have been a bmw(2 740il, one 850csi), \\rtwo porsche, and this is my first \\rAudi.  This is the finest automobile I \\rhave ever driven...second is not \\rclose!  There is nothing, nothing, that \\rwas not perfect at delivery...and it \\rhas remained that way for the first \\r8,000 miles. I HAD TO HAVE IT! I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO LOOK FOR A\\rREPLACEMENT OF MY AUDI A6. I WANTED\\rSOMETHING AND DECIDED THAT THE\\rCONVERTIBLE WAS IMPRACTICLE SINCE I HAD\\rTWO CHILDERN AND I DIDN\\'T WANT A TRUCK.\\rI SAW THE A8L AND I ASKED TO TEST DRIVE\\rIT. I TOOK IT FOR A RIDE AND COULD NOT\\rBELEIVE HOW IT HANDLED AND COULD NOT\\rBELEIVE HOW FAST I\\rWAS GOING. \\r AFTER I BROUGHT IT BACK AND DROVE MY A6\\rHOME, I KNEW I HAD TO GET. THE CARS\\rADAPTIVE SUSPENSION AND WIDE WEELS MAKE\\rTHIS CAR A DREAM TO RIDE ON THE HIGHWAY.\\rTHE PICKUP IS QUICK FOR SUCH A BIG CAR. \\r Big Car Drives Like a Small Car A8 is so much fun to drive. Traded in \\rmy S500, and the A8 has a much \\rsportier ride and handling. Powerful \\rengine. Design is beautifully \\rsimple. Interior is exquisite. I love \\rthe MMI, navigation is much better \\rthan MB. Several nits: Slight \\rhesitation on rapid acceleration, \\rPass. rear headrests obscure rear \\rright view, phone not really \\rintegrated into car system the way it \\rwas in my MB(almost like an \\raftermarket add-on),dynamic memory in \\rradio doesn\\'t find all the major \\rstations, If you leave the wipers \\rturned on when you shut the car \\roff, they do not start again when you \\rstartup the car- you have to turn the \\rwipers off and then on again. Audi Critique Automatic trunk closure never worked  A8L tops all others I have rotated back and forth between \\rMercedes and Audi, and occassionally \\rthe nightmare of BMW.  I have traded in \\rmy 2001 S500 4Matic for the new Audi \\rA8L. The ride of the new A8 is \\rcomparable to that of my Bentley\\'s. I \\rmust say it is one of the best luxury \\r(non-exotic)  cars I have owned \\respecially with Audi\\'s Quattro AWD \\rsystem, best in the market. Benz\\'s \\r4Matic is no comparison, \\rhad many near accident experiences with \\rthe S-Class along with other numerous \\rtechnical errors. This car has a classy \\rand sport look, exquisite and spacious \\rinterior, and to top it off, it bears \\rGermany\\'s most prestigious brand. Yes, \\rthat is the four-rings of Audi! My new A8 I\\'ve had the car for only 2000 miles, I \\rlove it so far. Run, dont walk to your Audi dealer !! From the inception of the sale to the \\rdelivery was the most professonal and \\rbest experiences I have ever \\rhad.Shelton Motors are first \\rclass.Having owned a 745iL,911 and \\rtrading my 2001 s55 amg I can assure \\reveryone this is \"THE CAR\"at a fraction \\rof its real value.Having paid a $102k \\rfor the amg I still feel I was\"Taken \\rfor a ride.\"Not only did the Mercedes \\rABC suspension FAIL and leak often.The \\rcar stunk like a bad escalator.Mercedes \\rcouldnt fix it.The cure was simple I \\rtraded it in.\"Wow what a car\".With \\rproduction \\rnumbers low it wont be like the \\rmercedes or the BMW.\"They are like \\rbellybuttons everyones got one\". Sleeper This car is incredible in what it \\rdelivers for the money compared to \"the \\rother two brands\". Smooth, powerful, \\rroomy, excellent workmanship both \\rinside and outside. Well thoughtout \\rcontrols. Pretty Disappointed Aside from the \"tyre\"  pressure monitor \\rnot indicating which tire is low, the \\rmain problem is jolting acceleration. \\rPowerful engines can still have smooth \\racceleration.  The rear seat headrests \\rare so ill-designed that it is just a \\rmatter of time before fatalities occur \\rduring lane changes due to an \\runnacceptably wide blind spot that \\rrequires the driver to contort his neck \\rto see if the coast is clear. And what \\ris the deal with the coat  hooks which \\rare the size of thumbtacks? Don\\'t bring \\rmore than one hanger when you travel or \\ryour clothes will be all over the \\rfloor.  Don\\'t buy this Audi on looks \\ralone. Test drive it first with my \\rcomments in mind.  Great great car with alot of room Love this Car Traded my 3 year old S500 for this car \\rand I love it - much prefer it to the \\rBenz, and even to the BMW I had before \\rthat. Very sporty ride and handling, \\rwhich I love, and I just love the way \\rit looks.  I know some have suggested \\rit could use a little more power, but \\rI find it at least comparable to the \\rS500, if not better.  Gas mileage also \\rcomparable to Benz. The MMI only took \\rme a few minutes to figure out, much \\rto my surprise.  What a car! This is the next generation of luxury  A8L Masterpiece Choose the A8 over the 7Series.  Glad I did.   a great performance as a former bmw 7 series driver i have  The Best of the Best Incredible vehicle. The looks, the \\rtechnology, the ergonomics, the \\rperformance, it\\'s all here. Compared to \\requilly equipped S Class or 7 Series, \\rit\\'s a bargain. You also stay \"under \\rthe radar\" as far as broadcasting \\rostentatious wealth.  Nice Car Luxury inside and out. Everything you  2004 A8 This car is outstanding. The quality, \\rride and performance are superior to \\rany car I have driven. They figured out \\rhow to make a luxury car perform like a \\rsports car. It is far superior to my \\r2000 A8 - no comparison really. It took \\rme about a week to fully master the \\rMMI - not bad - and now I marvel at all \\rit can do so easily. Phone Issues As a previous BMW 745il owner I have a \\rgood idea for the cars differences. The \\rA8l is a good car comparatively from a \\rperformance point of view to the BMW \\rand a hands down winner from a looks , \\rboth in and out, point of view. the best car I\\'ve ever had while driving you enjoy satisfaction  Good CAR I think this is a great car with  Unbelievable Car This car is incrdible. They have really \\rdone their work. Audi should be proud \\rof their accomplishments. I am just \\rtickeled that I only had to pay $77,000 \\rfor this awesome vehicle. Mercedes \\rcould not touch the aminities of this \\rcar for the price. In fact for them to \\roffer us a car with the same aminities \\rwould run more than $90,000 (including \\rAll wheel drive. You just have to try \\rit out for yourself. Thanks Audi! Fantastic Machine!! After owning BMW 7s for years, this car \\ris incredibly smooth, quiet, and \\rpowerful.  Handling/power is excellent \\rand comfort/interior appointments are \\rsuperb.  Living in Florida, I won\\x92t \\rtest the four-wheel drive to any great \\rdegree, but the adjustable height \\rsuspension has come in handy with all \\rthe flooding we\\x92ve had (I used the lift \\rmode to raise the body to go through \\rsome bad flood areas - A brand new \\rLS430 was not as fortunate). Audi has \\rclearly designed a winner and with \\rAudi\\'s low production numbers, it \\ris also a car that has a high measure \\rof exclusivity on the road.  I am soooo \\rhappy I didn\\'t buy a 745 or S500 while \\rwaiting for this car!!! A Truly Intelligent Car A little study before starting, then \\rset ALL the various components of the \\rcar in the MMI system and ENJOY! Audi \\rhas used the best features from \\rcompetition, improved them, and added \\rtheir own innovations. Steering is \\rvery precise. The car is so smooth but \\ryet nimble like a sports car with the \\rair suspension set on \\'dynamic\\'. A 400 \\rmile trip was  effortless and fun \\rtrying out all the variations and \\roptions in the MMI. This Audi attracts \\ra crowd. I will enjoy this car every \\rday as it is the best car I have ever \\rowned.  really sorry BMW Great handling car with the looks to \\rmatch.  Very quiet and a great \\rhandling car.  I did not like the 19 \\rinch wheels because the car was more \\rnoisy and did not travel the road very \\rwell.  However the 18 inch all season \\rtires are better matched for my \\rclimate and driving.  Also the CD \\rplayer quit after 2 days,but it is \\rreplaced.  The sound system is good in \\rurban areas however the reception in \\rrural areas is not as good as my old \\r98 A8 or my Town and Country.\\r This car is gonna get EVERY single award I LOVE THIS CAR!!!! The 19\" wheels \\rgive a sporty appeal to the exterior. \\rI tried out my friends BMW 745i (same \\rprice but smaller) and the i-drive was \\rTERRIBLE!!! Audis MMI, however, is \\rVERY user-friendly!! Audi, you made \\rthe PERFECT CAR!! Awsome car This is the best car i ever  This car is the best car ever!!! i like this car very much The best of the competition Nearly perfect in every way. No More Sleepless Nights for Me! I did not need another new car but I \\rcould not sleep for 2 nights after my \\rfirst test drive...so the third day I \\rwent back and got a silver one with the \\r19 inch wheels! Now I cannot stop \\rdriving it...I have already put 2,000 \\rmiles on it during the first \\rmonths..and usually I drive only about \\r300 miles per month. Audi A8L 2004 -- Audi hit a homerun The car looks great and drives even \\rbetter -- first real experience with a \\rluxury car and am totally impressed.  \\rThe car has class written all over it \\rwithout the glitz of the S Class or 7 \\rSeries.  Great car for those of us that \\rappreciate quality and elegance but \\rdon\\'t need to pay a premium for an \\rinferior \"better known\" car \\r(Mercedes/BMW).  Well worth the wait! Nothing compares to this car! I have owned everything from Porsche \\rto Jaguar to Mercedes.  I have never \\rdriven any car off the lot that \\rcompares to the Audi A8L! It is like \\rhaving the best of everything.  Can\\'t \\rjudge reliability yet, but based on my \\rwife\\'s 2003 S6 Avant I can only assume \\rit will be its equal.  I waited for \\rits arrival this month and had \\ractually expected to be disappointed \\rand end up buying the S500. After a \\rtest drive up a twisting mountain road \\rand an open stretch of highway I \\rbought the car upon returning to the \\rdealer.    New A8L even better than old I loved my \\'01 A8L and didn\\'t think \\rthat it could be improved upon - but \\rthe new car is better in every way. I \\rdidn\\'t even consider any other brand. \\rThe MMI was frustrating for the first \\rfew days, but has now become second \\rnature. I couldn\\'t be more pleased.\\r  Top of the Class This car has raised the bar on the \\rLuxury Sedan Class.  Quality, Comfort, \\rFit & Finish at supurb.  The drive is \\runique for the class, very sporty yet \\rno less luxurious than a Mercedes S \\rClass or BMW 745Li.\\r Audi deserves a standing O for this one! Wow Watch out Lexus, BMW, and MB, your \\rundersized, overpriced lux sedans are \\rabout to be outsold by this new \\rcar...all i can say about this car is \\rwow... YOWZA!! The handling was firm, responsive and\\rimpressive. Solid throttle response.\\rCornered in rain at 35 without a\\rproblem. Adaptive air suspension\\radjusted to conditions. Stunning body\\rstyle,interior look/feel and comfort. \\rMMI seems intimidating-not true.  Sharp,\\rclear visual display and options on the\\rMMI and all dash components.  So quiet\\rand comfortable you can forget you\\'re\\rdriving. Surround sound is near symphony\\rquality. I\\'ll sleep in this car over my\\rbed anyday! Kids will not get these keys. Please do not buy this Audi!  I bought the Audi A8L about 14-15 months ago.  It STINKS.  I am actually going to sell it.   One thing after another breaks.  Two Audi places cannot figure out what\\'s wrong with the sensors that monitor the tire pressure.  The window regulator broke, the adjustable headrests broke on 2 seats, the adjustable lumbar support broke on 2 seats, and MORE.  The car is not reliable.  The driver controls are NOT well thought out.  The NAV STINKS, none of the controls are self explanatory, you cannot see the display with polarized glasses on if you are in the driver\\'s seat.  The speakers are not that good, the responsiveness is not good, and gas mileage is BAD. I could go on! Simply Outstanding Auto This is my fourth Audi, my second A8, this time an A8L with most of the options. Best automobile I have ever owned and operated. Quiet, sure-footed, solid vehicle that pampers the occupants in sumptuous surroundings. Contrary to some reviews, I find this car to be quite economical regarding gas consumption as I am getting between 34 and 37 mpg cruising at 60 mph (100 kmh). City mileage around 20 mpg. At 44000 km (27000 mi) changed tires for Michelin Pilot A/S. Any complaints about rough ride and road noise evaporated with the new rubber. Give me a brake (yes brake) To be in the big league price category \\ryou need a reliable well riding \\rautomobile. My A8L had brakes replaced \\r4 times in 50,000 miles. Navigation had \\rto be replaced. Tire pressuer monitor \\rnever worked properly. I disconnected \\rit. The timing chain had to be replaced \\rat 51,000 miles. Noise level high, I \\rused to think a window was open. Still \\rdo. Forget about the suspension, My \\rsons Civic takes the bumps better as \\rwell as the curves.\\r  Excellent stealth vehicle I like everything about this car, except\\rnavigation sistem. Car is very smooth \\rand quiet, and my kids really like all \\rthat space on the back seats.\\rI never had any problems with vehicle, \\rand was in service only for regular \\rmaintenance. It\\'s excellent car without \\rto much bling-bling. excellent driving The A8L(2003) is one of the finest cars  Unhappy A8L Owner This vehicle has been in the shop 3 \\rtimes since I leased it on 2/1/03 for \\rvarious problems.  The tire pressure \\rwarning light came on the very first \\rday I had the car (tire pressure \\rsensors were ultimately replaced). The \\rfuel gage was faulty and I ran out of \\rgas while the gage read 1/3 tank full \\r(\"fuel gage sender\" was ultimately \\rreplaced). The check engine light came \\ron the very next day after having \\rpicked up the car from the shop the \\rsecond time.  It would not hold an idle \\rand died unless I kept my foot on the \\rgas (\"instrument cluster\" was \\rreplaced). The navigation system \\rshorted (\"navigation cd assembly\" was \\rreplaced). The 740i\\'s & S430\\'s serious alternative The A8 has provided me thus far with \\rremarkable agility and comfort for a \\rhigh class sedan.  It has given me a \\runique alternative to its brethren at \\rMercedes Benz and BMW, a package \\rthat offers indivudual styling, the \\rconfidence of quattro, and a very \\rstylish and yet conservative-minded \\ratmosphere in the cabin. Good car Well proportioned body offers a great find bellow The only problem I have is concerned to \\rthe maintenance in Rio de Janeiro.\\r As A8 is a very sofisticated vehicle \\rcompletely computorized, unffortunately \\rour dealers and the Sena Representative \\rhave not engineers with knowledge to \\rtake care of it A8 my dust fun. fun. fun. esp for such a large \\rluxury sedan. we wanted a high \\rperformance car as well as something \\rlarge enough to travel with small \\rchildren. I cannot say enough about the \\rperformance for such a large vehicle. \\rthis car purrs like a cat at 2500-2800 \\rrpm (95 mph) which is about the perfect \\rcruising speed. Too bad we dont have an \\rautobahn. fuel economy is good 17.5 in \\rtown 25.5 hwy w/ lead foot. minimal \\rupkeep, great service and the finish/ \\rtrim is immaculate, even after 2 yrs   It\\'s No Lexus!! The best car I\\'ve ever owned. Not as \\rquiet and as functionally/logically \\rlaid-out as the Lexus (wife\\'s). Fun to \\rdrive, excellent fuel economy and one \\rseldom sees another one. awesome car Wanted a full-sized luxury sedan but \\rRWD BMW 7-series too risky for midwest \\rwinters. Went with A8L because of 4WD. \\rVery happy with car. Definitely more \\rcomfortable seats than MB S430. \\rOriginal tires were Dunlop 8000 \\rperformance tires but ride was too \\rrough so dealer switched them to Toyo \\rand ride much better. Will get much \\rbetter milage with 18\" wheels but less \\rride comfort.\\rI\\'m getting 22mpg city and 29mpg \\rhighway! There\\'s nothing this car \\rcan\\'t do. It\\'s awesome! Best Luxury Car On TheMarket Absolutely the best luxury car on teh \\rmarket. Those that know, own an A8. I \\rhave owned a 740i and this car excels \\rin every way the BMW could not. Audi A8 L The car is beautiful on the inside, \\rbut, the outside design is somewhat \\rbland.  The car handles wonderfully and \\ris a lot of fun to drive, especially in \\rsport mode. Audi A8L Review Car is fun to drive and handles the \\rroad very well.  There have been \\rproblems w/ the navigational system as \\rwell as a warning light that never \\rwould go off even after being fixed \\ronce.  The audio/radio system is not up \\rto standard w/ Lexus or BMW. For a \\rluxury car it should be better.  \\rLastly , the clock is in front of the \\rdriver and cannot be seen be any other \\rrider. A8 is Sweet The A8 is by far the sweetest car I have owned. It\\'s the only luxury car with all-wheel-drive (great for getting to and from Lake Tahoe in the winter snow season). It handles like a dream even with large mud and snow tires. I generally drive in automatic mode, but the Tiptronic shifting is fun when I am in a \"playful\" mood. Gas mileage has been very acceptable in the 20+ MPG range. It\\'s been extremely dependable and Audi covers 100% of all regular maintenance, even replacement of wiper blades. The L version is best if you want lots of room in the rear. \\r All in all the A8 is a great car for the money! Go with the S8 if want even more than 310 HP (but the A8 is plenty fast for me). Ultimate Q-ship Cleanest design of all large sedans. Extreme comfort and adequate power. Purchased a used one off lease and saved 50% of sticker price. Not sure if it was very well cared for or the build quality is that exceptional, but the car is in nearly brand new condition after 36k miles.  Understated Elegance I\\'ve owned an LS430, E430 MB, and driven 5 and 7 series BMWs.  This is by far and away the most refined yet sporty total package that I\\'ve ever driven.  I\\'m always looking for reasons to take this care out on the road.  It\\'s suspension and handling are amazing, combining control with the smoothest most comfortable ride while avoiding the numb feeling that I used to experience with the Lexus.  The whisper quiet interior (absolutely gorgeous in cognac brown) allows me to hear my iPod/CDs/Sirius through the B&O audiophile system.  What an amazing aggregation of technology, craftsmanship, thoughtful design. Driven for one year - no problems yet.   Better than the rest Not unlike the rest of the reviews above I have owned most/all of the flagship vehicles. I am impressed by the smooth yet responsive ride, the interior room and the ease of electronic use. I looked at MBZ 500, BMW 7 series and the Lexus, either they were to vanilla or to cheap this is a beautiful car. Timeless Quality and Performance I\\'ve owned Lexus LS and SC430s, a MB E500, and test driven every BMW and MB over the past decade. The Audi A8 exudes a quiet confidence and athletic ability that places this sedan among the best in the world. I\\'m always amazed by the incredible 26 MPG highway even though I\\'m usually pushing 70-75mph in a serenely quiet yet totally responsive car. The MMI provides an intuitive control of audio, nav, car settings, and telephone that is simple yet sophisticated in performance. Handling is a dream with precise steering and a totally compliant suspension that seems to anticipate the movement of the car, rather than the bucking and fitfull suspensions that typically accoompanies a 2 ton sedan. A8 still the best The A8 is still the best value among large luxury sedans. I\\'ve owned BMWs and driven a colleague\\'s S550 and the A8 is just superior everywhere it counts. I still can\\'t believe how comfortable and fun this car is. I find myself looking for every excuse to go anywhere in this car on any errand. I opted for the L for extra leg room. Kids can\\'t touch the back of my seat no matter how far they stretch. Important options are the acoustic glass which makes it quieter than the S550, ventilated seats, 19\" wheels, and Lane/Side Assist because it actually helps. The ride is fantastic on rough New England roads and you never feel like you\\'re rushed when you\\'re in this car. Best car I have ever driven.  Fun to drive luxury This is my 3rd A8 and by far the best. They have all been agile, manuverable cars but this seems to have that little extra \"punch\" that makes it better. The navigation system along with all the elaborate computer driven choices for comfort, etc. is the most user friendly of any of the luxury cars today. The car delivers 26-27 mpg at a steady 70 mph and I average about 18 in the city. I\\'ve had this A8 just 4 months so far and have not been back to the dealer except for the first 5000 mile service. I\\'m a happy camper. Top Shelf After owning a MB S430, S600 and a 2007 S550, all of which had relability issues I decided a change was in order. I have had this car for only a few months and it gives one a rick solid feel as well as having the finest fit anf finish on any production car I\\'ve ever seen.  Also, taking into account the cost versus an MB S550 or a BMW 7 series, the Audi\\'s price is quite reasonable by comparision. If you\\'re thinking about buying a MB or BMW, do yourself a very big favor and go test drive an Audi A8, you\\'ll really be gald you did, the only thing that comes close is perhaps a Bentley \"Flying Spur\", which shares many of the same features as the Audi A8, of course both companies are owned by VW. Fun to Drive/True Luxury I love this A-8. After owning various Jaguars, Lexus (which was also terrific), Infinity Q-45, various BMW models and other luxury vehicles, the Audi A-8 is by far...the best. The interior is true luxury, the ride is exceptional, we love the Nav system which also operates most functions of the vehicle,and the stereo system is terrific.  Exceptional fuel mileage too! When I am ready to trade in this vehicle I believe I will get another Audi.  Solid Luxury Ordered on 27 June and took delivery on 6 October.  Currently I have a little over 2000 miles on the vehicle.  Long distance trip from DC to Chicago for Thanksgiving was wonderful.  Sport package with 20\\x94 wheels provided excellent ride and handled wonderfully through rain and freezing rain.  The standard features and options make this vehicle a fantastic driver\\x92s auto.  Sporty response for a large vehicle.  Solid brakes, great vehicle lighting features (headlights, interior lights, entry, braking and fog lights \\x96 front and rear).  No problems to note.  MPG for the trip 22-24.  Around DC area, 18-20 mpg.  Audi does European delivery After years of Mercedes ownership (and a brief BMW period) I finally got over to Audi. This car is everything that Mercedes used to be. Understatedly elegant, fantastically finished and user friendly. What a true pleasure to drive. In fact, what a pleasure to just sit in. Nobody does interiors like Audi. It is just beautiful, comfortable, and functional. We took delivery in Germany at Ingolstadt, which was a once in a lifetime experience, and did use it on the Autobahn. 130 mph is like 60 mph. wonderful road car! While I think Mercedes has lost their way, Audi seems to have really found their\\'s. Some people are put off by the conservative styling of the exterior. I find it refreshing. Can It Really Get Any Better Than This? Purchased with 65k 3-12 and sprung 3k for extended warr that takes me to 115k or 2017. So far I have only been able to use warr for a water pump ($1300). Yes, it is expensive to maintain. Every time I slide behind the wheel a sly grin creeps across my face. I\\'ve put 30+k on the odo, everything from Walmart trips to 600 mile East Coast jaunts through the mountains of PA and NY.This car does everything superbly. Accelerating, steering and braking exude confidence at every moment. Interior gauges, controls and ergonomics are perfect. Headlamps and cornering lamps are absolutely outstanding.My son just got his license, and I sat in back for  essentially the first time. What a lot of room!**Final Update**Repair trips to the dealer became onerous....it was always $1500 for this and $1500 for that. Finally traded it in for a 2014 Cadillac CTS4 Performance, The Caddy is a bit smaller but carries itself with 90% of the Big Audi\\'s capability. Unless I hit the lottery, I\\'m sure the Audi will be the finest car I\\'ve owned since I started driving in 1973 and have owned well over 30 vehicles. Best of the lot Drives exceptionally well for a big car. More stable and faster than my Infiniti M35X. Beautifully crafted and actually gets better mpg than the 6 cyl Infiniti. Comfort features are better than Infiniti and Acura. This car is meant to be driven long and hard (fast). After my Lexus, Acura and Infiniti, I was a bit scared to go to Audi, but now I look forward to my next excuse to drive. A true luxury car that responds to sporty driving with ease. Best road handling I\\'ve had, including some smaller sportier cars.  Quiet and solid Traded in a 2007 A8 with sport package for 2009 A8L.  Miss the looks of the 20\" wheels on 07 but passengers like the back seat better and the 09 19\" wheels are easier to clean.  Solid 24 mpg highway at 75 mph cruise.  15-16 mpg around town.  Great cars and get a lot of positive comments from strangers about what a beautiful car.   Quiet and solid.  Can\\'t imagine it getting much better than this.  Engine management Replaced an identical 06 with this vehicle.  I am having problems with the engine management of the new car.  Idles rough hesitant upon acceleration and downshifts with surges unexpectedly. A8L Great Car This is my third A8 after coming out of a 2007 Q7 4.2.  The Q was great also, but this new A8L is terrific. Audi has continued to refine the car and it handles and drives like a much smaller car.  I have also had several Mercedes large sedans and the A8 is just as good or maybe better without being so obvious on the road.  Great car. Beautiful Car I have had this car for three months now. Really wanted to get a S550, but I am thrilled I ended up getting the A8L. It is a blast to drive, much sportier and understated. When I am buying my next car it will be another Audi A8L, each time I drive the car I am reminded why I love it. On my Second!!! After two 7 series BMW\\'s, I am now on my 2nd A8L after trading in my 06!Few people noticed that I have a new car! Looked at S550, LS460L,750Li but nothing compared to the materials, ergonomics and ease of use as the Audi. Now have USB connection for flash drive with MP3s and somewhat improved dash display. I prefer the MMI to the Mercedes iCommand or the Lexus touch screen currently available. The previous MMI display had matte finish which matched the other materials and looked much nicer then the glossy bezel now used. Parktronic now has a camera in addition to the great graphic display. My previous proved very reliable with the Sirius Module being the only item which failed in 3 years.  Couldn\\'t be happier The Audi A8 is the best car I have ever owned. I have owned Audis before and finally made the jump to the flagship. The only problem is that I could never go back to a lesser car. It drives like a dream, is simultaneously luxurious and sporty, does everything well, is unflappable under all road conditions, and has unquestionably the best interior in the automobile industry. I have driven it 600 miles at a stretch and didn\\'t actually want to get out.  Fantastic car Bought this to replace Lexus LS 430. My wife and I like the A8 interior much better than the new LS models. Car drives great, and has all the features you expect in a car in this price range.   Sometimes wish I had it. Owned it for 3 months as a car to get around in until I got a more suitable vehicle for work. Maintenance was a mixed bag. It\\'s easy to work on, it\\'s just time consuming sometimes. Only problem I had was the fuel pump had gone out just as I was about to get my new car.  For a car with 250k miles it did it\\'s job and then some, and surprised at how it held up despite concerns about \"german reliability.\" Transmission shifted a little too loosely for my taste but a quick 5 minute recodding on a scantool or VAG fixed that real quick. As a used cheap daily under $2k. It\\'s second only to my old LS400. If I had to, I\\'d buy one again. 97 Audi A8 awsome car This is my second Audi a8 my first one was totaled but it definitely saved my life when hit a huge elk buck on 285 outside of Buena Vista . This car is the safest car structurally I\\'ve ever ownedThe elk was tossed up into the air when I hit it on drivers side at 70 mph. It landed on the windshield/roof and sunroof. This elk was huge and I would have been killed if not for how structurally sound this car is In any other car it would have crushed it  up like an aluminum can For a car that is over a decade old it still turns heads great ageless design. In the past I have owned  both a Mercedes S 500 and a BMW 740il. The Audi A8 is by far the all around winner and it\\'s AWD which neither the BMW or Mercedes was in 97 it\\'s a beast in the snow as I reside in Colorado.I did have to R&R the ZF5 HP24, not an easy job,but we\\'ll worth it. This car is so comfortable to drive on long road tripsSet the cruise control and lounge back in the 12 way adjustable/heated seats You can feel the quality that was built into this car you can tell that this car was 75k new Ugly but overall a great car Ijust reached 200,000 miles on my car it runs well very comfy and very fun to drive a great car for student drivers Audi A8 Very well engineered car. Interior is awesome. Leather is still soft, no rattles, everything works, very solid car.  Engine is teriffic. Smooth, quiet, with enough power to get you where you are going.  Suspension is a little loose for my tastes, but very smooth over bumps. Steering is feather light and very nice.  Transmission had failed at 170k. Not unexpectedly with the D2 A8. Tranny shifts are slow and tall gearing can make the car feel slow when not in the correct gear.  Fuel mileage is great for a car this big at about 25 mpg average when using cruise most of the time.  I\\'ve had to replace a couple of things here and there but nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe the only 3.7 model left in USA? I bought mine used in 2002, have driven it 80,000 miles since. Build quality, handling, performance are great. Many small things have failed though, and at 170K miles it\\'s on its third transmission (!). No other mechanical issues though. The engine is fantastic, still tight and strong and using no oil. I\\'ve driven the 4.2 AWD models as well, and I have to say I prefer the handling of my FWD 3.7 model.  Weight is only 3600 lbs, about the same as a Subaru WRX.  The 3.7 seems to have virtually disappeared from the roads now, though.  At current rock-bottom prices these are a stupendous bargain. An automotive jewell! I purchased a used \\'97 Quattro with all extras - winter, hot weather and convenience packages. On top of that the Nav system is upgraded to the Euro version with a big screen in the center console, as well as 3 10\" subs in the trunk. All I need is a Phatnoise MP3 player in place of the CD changer, and a fridge, and I can live in this car. :)) Learn how to do small repairs and you\\'ll avoid the dealer charges. I just replaced valve cover gasket myself - $60 for parts (not from the dealer - plenty websites sell original parts) and two hours because I took my time. I change my oil, brakes, sparkplugs, and other simple maintenance! LOVE THIS CAR!!!!  I purchased this car new.  I feel it is an AWESOME car, the experience to have this car will stay in my memory forever. I LOVE the way it drives, very powerful and solid, can move QUICKLY when needed and beautiful inside and out! I can\\'t imagine driving another car! Stay away from Audi A8s We own an A8 after a long series of Audi\\'s.  This car is crap.  Electronics are a total failure, Audi knows the transmissions are defective but won\\'t do anything, both windshields cracked, coolant and fuel lines had to be replaced, the heater and AC are terrible; this is the 3rd week of AC repairs at large cost, the sun roof leaks, and the overall quality is terrible... not as good as a cheap Fiat.  It is not surprising Audi can\\'t be reached by email.  Many dealers refuse to sell 1997 A8\\'s.  Keep your eyes open, you\\'ll see lots of newer ones broken down.  A8s are crap! Love the Car...hate the maintenance cost This is really the finest of cars.  I\\rlove the performance, comfort, and\\rdriving characteristics.  The only issue\\ris the exorbinate price of repairs. \\rDriven entirely by Audi\\'s excessive\\rprices.  The screw in replacement\\rantenna cost over $150 (dealer is only\\rplace to get part).\\r You will love the car, but expect to pay\\r($$$) for that love! Excellent Car This car looks much better in real-life  A Great Sedan  I great handling performance sedan \\rthat deserves high ratings, including \\rexcellent fuel economy at any speed. \\rDepreciation is a bummer, so getting a \\rused model is the best value play. Great Car - Big Time Maintenence Great car, I miss mine every day......I \\rjust wish it didn\\'t cost a small \\rfortune to maintain the car Biggie sized A4 I enjoy the high-speed crusing at 85-90.\\r It is quite, refined, and solid, with\\rmore than enough power available at\\rhighway speeds.  You can drive for\\rextended miles on the highway and arrive\\rrelaxed.  The large fuel tank will allow\\ryou to go over 600 miles before\\rrefilling, but your bladder probably\\rwon\\'t last that long without a stop.  A\\rused A8 is a much better value than a\\rnew A4 for the same dollars. WHAT A CAR! I have owned Lexus LS400, Mercedes \\rS500, and BMW 750IL.  This car is by \\rfar the most fun to driveThe car is \\rultra smooth at speed in excess of 100 \\rmph, truely a car made for the auto \\rBahn.  I can\\'t believe this car gets \\rover 25mph on the freeway too! The \\rQuattro is an asset to the car that \\rmakes you feel confident in any \\rsnowy/rainy road... something most of \\rthe other luxury car maker have not \\rbeen able to match.  So for ultimate \\rsafety and performance, this car is a \\rdeal! Especially for a used one, since \\runfortuantely this car doesn\\'t hold up \\rits value very well new. A8 Rules!!! This car is the best-kept secret of the \\rautomotive industry.  It handles FAR \\rbetter than ANY BMW, and only the S55 \\rBenz can outclass it in performance.  \\rYou cannot spin the wheels, no matter \\rwhat the conditions.  A8 Roadside \\rassistance is the best.  Super luxe \\rinterior, and well-thought-out German \\rengineering in all departments.  A+++++ Better than the dealers can deal with This car is incredible.  No end to the \\rsmooth power, the transmission is \\rvery efficient, handling is awesome.\\r My main point in this review is to let \\rthe readers know that the 97 model \\rdoes need to have it\\'s atf fluid and \\rfilter changed at 45000 miles, per \\rthe manual.  That transmission oil \\rand filter change is skipped by many \\rdealers, as the later a8 \\rtransmissions don\\'t call for it.\\r It makes a huge difference in the \\rsmoothness and performance of the \\rtransmission, and probably the \\rtransmission\\'s life.\\r It\\'s living history, somday to share \\rthe pantheon with the Jaguar 120 \\rand the likes of the Cobra.\\r  Will buy another one The best car I have ever owned, including all of the luxury (production) models Three great months and counting... New to me 2006 A8L with 73k miles. Premium, sport and massage packages. This year is the first year with the single grill and the last year with timing belt engine.I\\'ve had 98 A8 for 7 years - loved the car and now this one is amazing. No wonder many people moved from BMW, Mercedes to Audi.Air suspension is comfortable and very convenient to raise the car up when going to a complex that has many tall speed bumps. The car is so powerful, fast but very nimble (drives like a small car) and still get average 19MPG (26 hwy). Soft close doors are nice (the doors got sucked in if close half way). I drive people who don\\'t know Audi on my A8L and they\\'re amazed at the comfort and design. The Best This car makes me look forward to going to work.  I\\'ve owned BMW and Acura and this car is above and beyond.  I am now a Audi fan for life. Officially switched from BMW to Audi After owning two BMW 3-series for the last 14 years, I decided to go with one of the large, luxury sedans.  Was considering the 5 and 7 from BWW and the E-class Benz.  Then I drove a friends A6 and was blown away. Added the A6 to the list and started looking.  Decided to \\'check out\\' the A8 and I was immediately sold. Nothing else compared after that. The A8 was extremely hard to find, but the one I landed on was nearly perfect - just about every option available and only 27k miles!  LOVE this car.   Best Sedan In its class I have been wanting an A-8 for years and finally ran across one worth buying.  Depreciation is heavy in the first 3 years but this is the best sedan in its class by far.  The MMI is awesome and extremely easy to figure out for a non-tech guy.  I have owned Lexus, BMW, and Acura and would not go back.  This is the car to own if you can afford one. The 2006 A8 Got Me to Switch Let me preface this review with I am a BMW guy. Having owned 5 of them (3\\'s, 5\\'s and 7\\'s) it has been my brand of car for years...until I needed to replace my 2001 740i Sport. The new 7 just leaves me cold and I am not an MB guy. May I just say that my new SWB Gray/Black A8 has simply blown me away. This is without question the nicest interior in any car costing less than a Bentley Continental and the fit and finish is the most perfect I have seen in any car. The exterior is sleek and aggressive and I love the new Audi schnoz.. The car rides beautifully and handles superbly. The controls are perfect, the shift paddles are fun and the MMI is awesome. I have my new dream car, sorry BMW. 3 Years Of Great Driving! After 3 years this car is fantastic! Cabin more luxurious and refined than Lexus or S class.MMI a marvel once fully learning its operation(took months).Car\\'s electronics are capable of doing much more then what was required in the past. The Audi solution is logical. The secondary display in the instrument cluster contains most information you need when accessing phone, destination and radio functions via the controls on the steering wheel. Buttons on the console to control the MMI display are conveniently positioned below the armrest. Voice command,slower than scrolling, works for many functions (would like available commands displayed on screen instead of system reciting).Replac Overrated I\\'ve had a series of Mercedes S- Classes and a Lexus LS430. This car gets good press for great ergonomics. In my opinion it is ergonomically below average. The MMI is terrible. Cup holder is shallow and when the cups interfere with the MMI controls. Nav system is a piece of junk. Can\\'t see out the rear window unless you have the dealer remove the rear headrests. Ride is brittle on concrete roads. Seat controls are confusing. Engine is noisy. The user interface on the Lexus is a 9.5, and a 5.0 on the Audi. Fit and finish are very good, seats are comfortable.  Best Large Luxury Sedan in the World Chose the car for its room (I\\'m 6\\'11) but have come to love its interior, handling/ride, quality, styling and power. The more I drive it, the more I love it.  Would not trade it to drive a Maybach, large Bentley or Rolls. BMW 750IL doesn\\'t even come close. Audi A8L Car has been flawless through almost 2 years of ownership.  Love the stealth factor, car is totally amazing.  Friends refer to it as the James Bond car, for all it\\'s gadgets and features.   Love my Audi A8L I have owned every major brand of luxury car and without question, this is the finest. The fit and finish is exceptional. The interior surrounds you in the finest wood and leather and the attention to detail in the interior trim is second to none. The exterior styling always draw attention whereever we go. We have had the car for 18 months and it has been trouble free. Several times my wife and I have been stuck in traffic and we have commented \"so what\" this car is one of the most comfortable places we could be. The car has plenty of power and actually feels like a much smaller car in the way it handles. This is my first Audi and I highly reccomend it.   An Ideal Car  This car is a unique blend of soft, smooth ride without the swaying of some cars.  This car also exhibits oustanding handling and acceleration. I also own a MB E320. The interior in this car is beautifully fit and finished. The driver\\'s seat is perfectly contoured and 12 (16?) way adjustable.The controls are logically arranged and are easy to use.  The MMI eliminates a clutter of dials and buttons,and is easy for an average person to use (unlike the MB 320 computer which is impossible). Do yourself a favor and consider this car for your next vehicle. Great Car This was the third Audi I\\'ve bought from this dealer.  Great service, and we were totally happy with the transaction.  The car is built like a bank valult and drives very responsively, even more responsively than my 2002 A6 4.2 sedan, which is also a great car. Creature comforts are amazing. The massaging seats are a plus, and seat heating is easy to set and change. Cupholders are OK, but do not quite accommodate the fancy Audi leatherette cups we also bought.  They are too tall for the holders. Technically, I have not yet mastered the Navigation or the phone, but we are getting there. A truly great car, indeed. Simply awesome... best of the class Getting straight to the point, I have owned BMW 7 series, Lexus 430 and Mercedes S series vehicles.The Audi A8L is undoubtably the most complete car I have ever owned (compared to the others). Yes, you lose a little performance to the BWM (very little, almost hard to notice), the perceived elite  status of the Mercedes (notice I said perceived...but not realized in the ownership experience)and the softness/comfort of the Lexus.  Now for tag line, if you want completeness, with very little compromise to the perceived strengths of the other three purchased the Audi A8L. The true and most complete athlete of the class. I may own an Audi A8L for many years to come. MB 550 vs. the Audi A8L 4.2  I love my A8L the MMI is perfect and easy to use, the Bose stereo is so much better than my MB Harmon Kardon stereo. The 4 wheel drive is nice to make a 4 when you make a u-turn. Lexus and Mercedes Move Over! After years of being afraid to purchase a German luxury car I finally decided to start looking at them again. Having driven a Lexus LS for many years I was looking to get something more driver oriented. The A8L was the car that stood out. I love this car!! The quality of the interior is amazing, the MMI sysytem is super easy to work and the handling is superior to the Mercedes S550 and the Lexus LS430. In bad weather the Quattro All-Wheel-Drive is very self assuring and I\\'m able to get everywhere I need to go. This is the car to have. I\\'m very very happy and satisfied with my purchase. Outstanding Prior cars include Lexus, BMW and Mercedes. I don\\'t know how I will feel three years from now, but after the first month I am blown away by the quality, style, performance, comfort ane ease of driving this car. The CD changer is in a far away place because the car is so wide and comfortable. Visibility, is a little tighter than what I am used to, but that gives it the style part! If you are considering a sedan in this price range, please do yourself a favor and take a look at the Audi. It opened my eyes, and I feel great about my decision! I look forward to enjoying it some more.  JF German Perfection for all of us! Just bought this beauty! Coming from MB500 and other Euros, I found this A8L to be an absolute perfect match for me. 83K loaded out the door, 17k less than the new MB550. 2nd day I owned her it snowed like crazy and I passed a Lexus like it was standing still. Wow what power and how about that \"can\\'t feel it transmission\" Drove them all and choose the style that drops your jaw. Had to get the \"L\" because at 6\\'3\\'\\' have to go all the way back, and the kids still can stretch out. Love it, without a doubt it\\'s he best. The Best Luxury Car Ever! I have owned several luxury cars in the past few years. I just finished my 2nd lease of a Lexus LS430. This time around I was looking for something a little more exciting to drive but did not want to give up the ride quality and quietness I had grown used to. I also wanted a car that handled much better. A friend suggested the A8L. I am so thankful he did. This is the best luxury car I have ever owned! The handling superb and the fit and finish of the interior and quality of materials is far better than the LS 430 I just turned in.  For those out there looking for a great luxury car listen to me; The Audi A8L is the car you want no questions asked! (And free maintenance is wonderful!) Great But... For some reason I felt it was time to replace my 01 BMW 740iL which I consider to be one of the best looking cars ever. New 7 series did not appeal much to me. My A8L has significant blind spot when changing lanes in heavy traffic. I enjoy the technology and the MMI offers many useful functions but I often take my eyes off the road to operate. Voice command and steering wheel buttons help a bit. Changing radio stations is cumbersome. The Nav is not as complete as my BMW. It often gets me to a street but not to exact location. The new grill adds distinction but previous looked better to me. Minor complaints only. Car is comfortable and enjoyable to drive. The interior really is beautiful. Glad we selected the A8 Audi management seems to understand that quality and performance will be rewarded.  We tried many of the competitive cars in this class and chose the A8 for its performance with Quattro technology and the best interior of its peers.  It is also nice to drive a best-in-class car without the haughty stigma attached.  If we had the opportunity to drive over 130mph daily I would have considered the M5 (even though I don\\'t like the body as much as the A8).  But now with the S8 on the way it may be a moot point.   An amazing day to day car.  (Note: Unless you are riding in the back seat, skip the L version.  The MMI is relatively easy to use.  Get the premium package if you can.)   A8L is the best! The 2006 A8L is an awesome car, it\\'s my first Audi and will by no means be my last! I drove the MB S500, and was turned off by the BMW 7 series\\' awful exterior and interior styling, so I went to Audi and fell in love with the A8L, great engine, the interior is exquisite and huge, and the exterior is refined but at the same time aggressive on the front end, a perfect design by Audi, it\\'s the best looking car on the road in my opinion. In the 3 months I have had the car I\\'ve had only one problem with the car, the MMI computer system went out suddenly one day and it took 3 days to get a new computer installed by the dealer, they say that this is a VERY rare occurance and I\\'m not concerned by it \" A Real Treat\" Leased a 2006 A8L for 36 mo.  It was a pleasure from day one. I\\'ve had 750 BMW in the past,  but there is no contest between the 2 cars. Appearance, ride, all the well thought out trinkets made for a great product and pleasure to have.  Mileage around town 15mpg and on the road (70-80mph) 24- 26mpg, not so bad. Try one, you can\\'t go wrong. What an Upgrade! I traded in my V8 Touareg for this SWB A8 with the same engine. More power and 1,000 pounds less equals joy at the pumps and on twisty backroads :) The MMI is overly done but you get used to it. The ride is superb, the interior is grand, and fit and build quality continues to set benchmarks. This car is so much more exclusive, better looking, and a better value than the all-too-common S-Class and 7-Series. BYE BYE BMW! I have owned two BMW\\'s (740il & 745li) I was accused of having an affair with my female BMW service advisor as I was visiting her every month with problems with my BMW.  I finally said enough is enough and went to Audi and test drove the 2006 A8L.  WOW!!  What a vehicle.  Not only has this car been wonderful to drive, the technology, using the MMI system is much easier to use then BMW\\'s Idrive.  I agree with the earlier review about the cup holders.  They are small, and not well positioned.  Every other aspect of the vehicle has surpassed my expectations! World\\'s Most Intelligently Designed Car The A8L is Audi\\'s finest... and the class\\'s finest. The car is immaculate, with alcantara inserts in all the right places, more than enough grunt, gorgeous, muscular, understated style, and nimble handling. There is not one problem with the saloon. I looked at the 750li also, but found it in one place to be too cold and business-like, where the A8L pampers you most: the interior. Both cars have powerful V8s, with the BMW being more powerful, but in a luxury sedan you must have a gorgeous interior. My A8 My previous Audi was a 2000 A6 4.2L.  So this year, I decided to take a look at the A8L.  I am thoroughly impressed would be an sad understatement!!  By far, this is the most impressive luxury sedan available.  It\\'s roomy enough for 4 linebackers with more room to spare.  The interior is impeccable, and the driving experience is more enjoyable every time I step into it.  Happy driving. Techno overkill I do think it\\'s the best looking car on the road.The ride and handling is exquisite. The fit and finish is flawless. Unfortunately the MMI is ill-conceived and annoying at best. You need to agree to a waiver every time you start the car; your bluetooth phone needs to be programmed every time you start the car; it\\'s a two step process to change the setting on the heated seats; the radio is the most annoying requiring multiple steps for every function. I owned an A6 4.2 and I\\'d love to have those simple functions back. The folks at Audi need to realize less is more and technology should enhance the driving experience. My 4th Audi is the absolute best ever! While the Audi A6 almost fits the bill, the A8 is quieter, tighter, and more fun to drive especially in Dynamic Suspension Mode.  The A6 almost has things working while in the A8 all systems are flawless.  Bluetooth, Voice command, MMI, steering wheel all work so well and are integrated perfectly-  This will be my dream care in my daily life now and for years to come Far better and exclusive The A8L is head and shoulders above the other cars I considered. The Mercedes dealer let me take an S500 for the weekend, the BMW dealer gave me a new 750iL. Both of them were much more common on the road than the A8. To match the A8\\'s list of features, you have to add thousands of dollars of options to both the MB and the BMW. And you still don\\'t get a car that looks as good or feels as good as the Audi. What an amazing car I just took delivery of a 2006 Audi A8 in quartz grey with a black interior with the standard wheel base.  The car is amazing and I drove the length of Vermont yesterday.  It performed beautifully on the highways and back roads and I am so glad that I chose this car.   Great Value for Money Having had enough of my Merc S55 which I was trading in a part at a time, I took a gamble on the Audi. The minute I sat in it I knew it was a classy car. I have done 15000 miles and aside from a few minor gripes (replaced power lift on trunk) it has performed wonderfully. Powerful, quiet and somewhat exclusive - you don\\'t see many on the road.  If you are in the 7- series, S-Class market, this will beat them hands down for the money. The  relatively easy to use MMI is pretty intuitive and doesn\\'t take long before you can navigate around all the features you need to with ease. The thing that amazes me the most is the roominess of the car. The rear is HUGE and appears bigger than my S class. Best of Luxury Traded 2004 A8L on 2006 and really like the new features added. New front end look is great.  Car is solid, quiet and fun to drive. Mileage is great for a big car. Best Luxury Auto The fit, finish, and ride are all superb! The V-8 is smooth as silk, and the all-wheel drive handles any road condition 12 months a year.  Anyone looking at MB and BMW need to compare with the A8.  After doing so, the obvious result wil be the Audi.  This is my opinion from a past MB and BMW owner. 1999 Audi A8 Great Car. I have owned this car since 2000 with 18,000 miles and now have 152,000. I have minor repairs done to this car like a few of the 4 ball joints that are on both sides of the car. Cruise control brake switch and thermostat. The front seat is sagging a little bit and I may take it apart to adjust. The center arm rest broke so I repaired it myself. I replaced the timing belt and water pump at 100,000. I recommend changing the thermostat at same time as timing belt and water pump. I have not had any transmission problems and I have not changed transmission fluid. I don\\'t drive it hard and fast and that policy seems to help longevity of any car. 145K and STILL going strong... After three years of ownership I have no complaints.When first purchased I decided to replace or rebuild all the systems (@123K) so as not to have any concerns for a few years.Having little service history I continue to think this was a positive move in spite of the moneys spent.Since these repairs were a few years back, I continue keeping the Audi looking good with interior repairs (headliner, tint, etc.)My greatest problem was locating a clean example of an A8 (this took months) due to their limited numbers and dubious ownership.  If you have never driven a A8 you need too.  Best driving vehicle I\\'ve ever owned in fifty years, bar none, including a 66\\' 911S that was close to perfect until the A8.  For my limited investment, I am more than pleased with this very fine example of German craftsmanship.Mileage: City 18/20  Highway 23/24 1999 Audi A8 Drives like a dream. Good handling. You have to step on the gas when taking off from a stop but once going, it\\'s ready to fly. Very comfortable especially on long trips. Expensive to repair. Lots of features to go wrong. It has 3 or 4 ball joints per side. I replaced 3 one side. The arm rest just broke and I haven\\'t priced that out but I heard it could cost up to $500. I\\'ll look for a used one. Recommended timing belt change between 80K and 100K cost was around $2K. I bought it with 18,000 miles and now have 102,000. It looks and feels better than most new cars. The blue book is only around $7K. I think it would be a steal at that price. 78,000 miles, 10 years old, Still Great I\\'ve had no problems besides the front rack a few years ago. ($2k). Just scheduled maintenance involved and PM changing the transmission filter and fluid a few weeks ago. No door dings or rust with the Alum body. No squeaks or rattles either. Undervalued in the market.  Deep pockets required A beautiful car; smooth and quiet ride.  Was looking forward to several years of ownership and driving pleasure.  However, transmission trouble, numerous MIL error codes and gasket leaks generated enormous shop bills, (primarily the labor to diagnose problem & access components for servicing).  There are few options for service outside of the dealer network.  Yet, dealers and independent shops that specialize in German automobile service alike seemed puzzled by some of the issues this car presented.  At purchase time, it looked like a bargain in comparison to the Lexus LS400.  However, long term cost of ownership is outrageous.  1 year repair/maint. costs exceeded $7K with no end in sight. Cost of Disappointment This car, while I love the styling and driving it, is the largest disappointment I have ever had in a car.  In the 19 months or so that I have had the car, I have had over $12K in repairs in the car.  Between depreciation and cost of repairs, the car has cost me nearly $2K a month to drive, not including gas and insurance.  I could have gotten a new BMW if I had wanted to pay that kind of money each month.  The transmission went out on the car at 92K miles and it is $5500 to replace through Audi.  Nothing from Audi has more than a 12 month/12K mile warrantee.  That is pitiful considering the cost and that there are no other replacements. Sad state of affairs These cars are really nice cars, however this particular model (mabye not the newer ones) has depreciated GREATLY over the years and has a ton of mechanical problems that are out of warranty and not cheap to fix. BEWARE of having to fix this car, it will NOT be cheap. That being said, it is a great car to drive and looks and handles very well. BMwho? Used to be a BMW nut, but now those double-\\rkidney-grille vehicles just give me the creeps. The \\rA8 has erased any former affection for the Bavarian \\rcreature. Audi is where it\\'s at. Faster and more \\rcomfortable than 740i, but much more subtle.  Brilliant This car is brilliant in design and  160000 miles  Just like new Just keeps rolling along. No repairs, \\rnormal maintence, 160000 miles.  Still \\rmakes 23 miles to a gallon. Lovin the A8 Had the car three  and a half years.  \\rInstalled S8 suspension.  Excellent \\rbuild quality and style, still gets \\rcompliments.  Excellent milage for 300 \\rhp V8. Very comfortable for long trips. \\rExcellent ride handling compromise \\rafter intalling factory S8/sport \\rsuspsension\\rHad a few minor issues covered under \\rwarrenty but my dealer (Hoehn) has been \\rgreat. Vermont A8 This car has great power and is a joy to \\rdrive.  Also, the car does great in the \\rwinter, and does not even need snow \\rtires in Vermont where we normally get \\rmore than 110 inches of snow. I have \\rnever been stuck, even going up in the \\rmountains while going skiing. 03-18-03 My car now has 103,000 and it has not \\rhad any problems at all.  Also, it does \\rgreat in the snow, even deep snow.  The \\rdual climate control is a well designed \\rfeature.  The heated seats work very \\rwell, and heat up fast even when it is \\r-25, like it was a few times this \\rwinter.  This car does not handle like \\rother cars in the same class, it feels \\rlight and nimble (relative to the \\rsize), and can be driven at it\\'s \\rhandling limits with ease. Unique I love my A8.  All wheel drive makes \\rit a MUST in Michigan.  $550 for a \\rbroken armrest, drivers side only is a \\rbit insane, but I expected it.  I \\rcan\\'t find any performance accessories \\rfor it on line. My 1999 A-8 A delight to drive. And a horror to \\rbring to the Audi shop. Their idea of \\rpricing is unreal. The major problem is \\rsuspension parts, obvious if you change \\ryour own oil as I do. Every carrying \\rarms has electronic sensors, it \\rappears. Nothing wears out without a \\rwhole subassembly to replace it. Most \\rawful: a broken headlight lens cost \\r$1100 to replace -- what? -- a light \\rassembly going deep into the engine \\rcompartment. That aside, this is the \\rbest car I\\'ve owned (second best was a \\r1994 Audi 5000 stick shift, just as \\rpretty in the driveway!). Never follow I purchased an A8 because a BMW \\rservice advisor recommended it over a \\rsimilar 740.  He was right!  Not only \\rwas it thousands less, but the \\rperformance is remarkable.  The car is \\rnoticeably more nimble than the BMW.  \\rThe quattro system was superb during \\rthe fall monsoons in Houston.  \\rAdvantage Audi in Houston treated me \\rlike royalty when I brought the car in \\rfor an oil change, which surprised me \\ras I bought the car in Ohio.\\r If you haven\\'t driven one, you should \\rbefore you buy any other premium car. My A8: So close to being a great car I was looking for a high quality car \\rthat didn\\'t attract attention. Puchased \\ran A8 lease trade-in with 28000 mi. \\rAutomatic everything. Wish I had seats \\rlike this in my house. Quick and agile \\rfor its size. Refreshing to drive. \\r19mpg around town. 24mpg highway. After \\r15000 miles were still getting to know \\reach other, but I\\'m hopeful for a long-\\rterm relationship. One of the Best BigEuro Sedans ever made Understated luxury in an all-aluminum \\rchassis and body.  It\\'s sportslike \\rhandling capabilities from this \"big \\rcat\" is just one of great things about \\rthis Audi A8.  After 3 years, it still \\ris as beautiful as the day I picked it \\rup and has the same tight and powerful \\rdrive feel too. Pearl 1999 A8Q Bought the car with 2600 miles on it \\rfrom Audi.  Great cruiser, handles \\rpretty well for a 4k lb car, German \\rcomfort/build quality and quattro \\rcannot be beat.  Burled walnut \\reverywhere.  The Bose stereo is only \\rOK - that\\'s the only gripe I really \\rhave as far as features.  A+ seats - \\rbig, firm and adjustable. What a car! This car is a great car in every way.  There is not a bit or wind or road noise at speeds of 75+ mph.  Also the engine is very powerful and quiet.  This car can handle better than cars that are much smaller and feels no larger than the A6 on the road. A8 Fun to drive, great acceleration, handling, great looking Audi A8 A fun to drive, powerful, classic looking, unpretentious, great for highway and on the curves, and with Quatro - good for all seasons. Amazing Ride! I have owned a Audi A6 4.2 Quattro, E350 Mercedes Benz, but the A8L 4.0T is by far the most spectacular car out of the three.  The car is efficient, extremely stylish and the performance is unparalled to any of the cars I have driven.  The 740i has nothing on this car.  The S550 is stylish, but sluggish compared to the A8L.  The E350 is absolutely a bore compared to the dynamics of the A8L.  I wouldn\\'t trade this car for the world. An extended warranty was cheap and assures me the stability that I want when I buy a supreme used car.  Do yourself a favor and check this car out.  I promise you won\\'t be dissatisfied. Too bad they stopped making this car in us I have the small wheelbase a8 which i love . This is my second one . Had 2 740 BMW . This car tops them . tops them . Will buy the longer wheelbase 2018 when it comes out later this year low down it is great,except too low for an old man to get out of i\\'m 6\\'4\" but do not bend as well as i used to.don\\'t have it anymore,was replaced by a mercedes m350,which was replaced by a Q3which was joined by a Lexus RH Best Luxury Car with great fuel economy This far best comparing S350, Jag XL, Lexus. Interior design is very luxurious with all and everything you expect luxury car should provide. Driving mileage per gallon you get is far better than Benz or any other in same class offered. I will highly recommend this car - less repairs and maintenance cost is affordable. you can decide your self after driving Benz, Lexus, Jag, that this car offers more than anything you expect. Audi made this TDI version very sleek and economical. This A8L TDI delivers good power, steering comfort and most bang for your bucks (after all you want to drive this car for feel of luxury) Surprising Luxury and Performance I have owned Audi A8 sedans previously but switched to Mercedes S Class a few years ago - all of these high tech sedans can be problematic due to the complexity of their electronic systems - so be prepared to buy only from a dealer with 5 star service - recently, I was intrigued by the 2014 A8L TDI diesel sedan\\'s specs and options so I acquired one - it does everything right, especially fuel mileage which surpasses my expectations - the A8L is \"sized right\" as compared to the lumbering S550 - the diesel performance is outstanding - the electronic gizmos are entertaining but most are not necessary for daily use - cons - lots of road noise from stiff tires, mediocre stereo, electronic failures German Quality Supple leather, led lights in and out, 8 speed trans shifts smoove, AWD handles easily, bang olf. sound is crisp, dream to drive on highway in dynamic or sport mode. Not as powerful as s550 or 750li yet still my choice...more features that actually work well. ex; night vision assistant is better than bmw and mbz. Interior luxurious and up to date with technology. Roomy and nimble..aluminium.  hard choice between comparable vehicles..but overall the best in my opinion for the LWB option. Love my Audi Very expensive to fix Audi Company Ihave owned a 2011 A8 and 2012 A6 and the basic cars work very well. But I am very disappointed in Audi Company in their technical service department and also with the National sales team.My A8 was having a electrical /mechanicalissue with the relay that controls the power brake system.My understanding is thatAudi technical support instructed the local Audi Mechanic to wrap insulation around the relay so I would not hear the relay closing and opening. The next item was to relocated the relay to another spot in the car so I would not hear the relay. Both of this approaches did not address the core issue of the problem why is the relay started working that way. Instead it appears that Audi was trying to mask the issue hope the owner would go away. This is very serious problem with this car and I would not aspect Audi would try to cover up of the issue.The next point is that I ask the local sales manager to see what Audi would do for a trade value on my car towards a newer one. The answer he give was that Audi would not help out in this matter besides not fixing the issue.Needless to say that the way Audihas handle this matter is very disappointingfor a company that is trying to make inroads in the high end market.  2011 AUDI A8L -  Awesome Car I took delivery of my 2011 A8L earlier this week. I live in the midwest where we received several inches of snow, which turned to ice covering most roads. I had my A8L only one day when I was able to test it in these conditions. I love this car. It handles great in the snow. Prior to my purchase I tested a Benz S550 and a BMW 750LiX drive turbo.Hands down the Audi is the best value for the money. The instruments are a bit complicated, but once you get used to them you appreciate all the car can do. The Audi A8L is very understated, which is one of the reasons why I chose it. I have the Bang and Olufsen sound system and it is amazing. Fun To Drive but Unreliable I\\'ve owned two A8s. One I bought new when the L version first came out in 2000 or 2001. It was a lemon so I sued Audi and got all my money back. I loved driving the car and thought this was an exception so I bought a precertified 1998 A8. Since then I have replaced millions of things. From the transmission (died at 86K) all the engine seals, all the suspension parts, oil cooler twice, fan, heater core (expensive!) etc. I still drive the car since I like it and it is cheaper than buying a new one since I don\\'t like the current body style. I don\\'t have a high opinion of build quality, but it is a great car and gas mileage is pretty good. Use the tiptronic for freeway driving 20% better economy. Love my quattro A8 Love my A8.  It now has 180,000 miles and going strong, great on highway. Have kept up with maintenance schedule and it still runs and looks like new but my kids said to sell it for a new one as I have had the same car for  10 yrs. I will be buying another Audi.  Stef\\'s A8 After owning numerous BMW\\'s and driving a lot more other cars in the past twelve years, this car is a revelation. I never thought that an Audi will give me so much driving pleasure plus doing it in utmost comfort and style. It is certainly a very beautiful car. Quattro Well built and high roadability particularly in northern climates where the quattro really helps.  Hardly any minor defects.  Excellent fit and finish.  Only drawback was that at 150,000 miles had several expensive repairs that were not routine maintenance including failure of the power windows, pulley bearing failures and computer controls failure.   A8 for life Yes I did buy a used A8 with 85k miles and started with tires, checkup, belts- waterpump-timing chains with my Audi machanic of 15 years.  I started to drive 100+ miles daily and never stopped.  This car needs to drive to stay fit and clean.  If you do a lot of short trips and cannot open this beauty up on the highway then this is not the car for you.  I now have 122k on my second year and other than a few pesky oil or water drips from the water pump side of the engine, the car is a 10. I drive fast (80-90+) when on the highway but city driving is also just fine.  Good mileage in the 20-23 mpg depending on speed but the all around average is 21. Poor visability and Arrogant Audi Safety issues are my main complaints. An\\raccident when I was run off the road\\rinto a 4\\'deep drainage ditch. $30,000s\\rworth of damage and the passengers\\rairbag fired with no passenger in the\\rvehicle or anything on the passengers\\rseat. Audi claims this is \"normal\" I do\\rnot think so a smart interlocked air bag\\ris not a maybe situation. The external\\rvision has far too many blind spots from\\rtiny mirrors, large A and C pillers. In\\raddition the rear seat head bolsters\\roccupy about 30% of the usable\\rvisability when looking to the rear\\rwhile backing up. The most important\\rpart of the rear window is the mid point\\rdown.   The Perfect Sleeper This car is fast, comfortable, low-key\\rand generally a joy to drive. For a car\\rwith a 300 hp v-8 and all-wheel drive,\\rit  has an unbelievable range on the\\rhighway. And because of the car\\'s\\rrarity, it\\'s not nearly as likely to\\r\"walk off\" (get stolen) as a Camry or\\rAccord. Also, because these cars\\rdepreciated so heavily, they are a\\rfantastic buy. Audi Won My Heart with My 1st A6 If you like nice, you\\'ll love \\ryour Audi, whether you purchase the \\rA4, A6 or A8. I have  moved up the \\rchain as my family and resources have \\rgrown. The Aluminum frame is what sold \\rme. Only three other cars have done \\rthis.Ferrari, Lambroghini and The \\rAcura NSX. The appointments leave \\rnothing to be desired. If I had \\ranything to say, the first would be \\rthe exterior design. I feel that have \\rnot made enough updates o change the \\rlines with the times, but many people \\rfeel it is classic. Should be illegal in US I\\'ve had this car since 2002 and it\\'s \\ramazing.  FUN, FUN, FUN to drive for \\rsuch a large car.  The engine is so \\rpowerful, it should be illegal in the \\rUnited States (I\\'m glad it\\'s not).  \\rFor a car of this size, the space \\rframe makes it feel incredible light \\rand nimble, but solid as a rock.  I \\rlive in the mountains of Utah and the \\rQuattro is a must have.  I forsee \\rmyself buying A8\\'s for many years to \\rcome. Used A8 is great value I bought a Quattro A8 that had just \\rcome off a lease, and find that it is a \\rgreat car.  Two years later, I now have \\r96K miles on it with only a few minor \\relectrical glitches (outside mirror \\rmotor).  The quality and performance is \\rsuperb. BUY ME! This must be the best car Ive ever \\rowned...Ive owed Mbs and tons of other \\rgreat cars but nothing to this...its \\rawsom power is amazing, 80-110 quicker \\rthan 0-60 (that is a big deal) breaks \\rstrong light weight...... Audi A8 3.7 I have loved this car since as long as \\rI can remember. It is everything with \\rout the snob appeal of MB or BMW, this \\rgem is so understaded its a shame. The best in fun per dollar Update 4SEP17:  Car is still fun to drive.  It has been trouble free for the past 1.5 years and I have added 10k miles to the odometer.  I got a stage 1 tune which is a mild upgrade in power and makes the car go fast.I spotted this car online and drove almost 3 hours in heavy traffic to finally locate this car.  I was not in a good mood by the time I got to the dealership.  When they told me the car was on their auxiliary lot one mile away I almost got back in my car to leave.  The dealer grabbed a car and talked me into riding with him over to this other lot.  The moment I sat in this Audi TT and started the engine I was grinning ear to ear.  This 2012 Audi TT is new to me for one month now.  I love driving it.  My wife loves driving it and riding in it.  That is a first and quite remarkable since I have previously owned two other roadsters which she did not care to ride in or even drive.  I have had a Miata and Z4.  Both are great for driving in the mountains.  I liked the Miata for its quick nimble handling (after some suspension mods and addition of a roll bar) but it was a bit cramped and underpowered for my tastes.  The Z4 didn\\'t lack power and had good interior room but lacked that nimble feel.  Trammeling was a bit annoying as well.  This TT is the best of both and then some.  It has the nimble handling and feel way beyond the Miata and is even a bit faster than the Z4.  It also has the interior room I want.  The sound of the engine and the fast, crisp shifts of this transmission are the best ever to me.  The Audi interior is pleasing to the eye and probably the nicest interior of any car in this class.  My only gripe so far is the Navigation/Entertainment system.  Entering an address or phone number into this radio has gotta be the most painful and cumbersome system I have ever encountered.  It works fine but plan some prep time before a trip to set up a route.  One good feature about this radio however is the screen.  It is bright and clear even in direct sunlight with the top down.  I haven\\'t gotten to do a lot of playing yet but so far, finding some curvy roads and engaging the paddle shifters is a blast.  This car is a stress reliever from the moment I turn the key. Lil\\' Blue Thing This is my 2nd TT. First one didn\\'t have quattro and the car needs it to get the power to the ground. Good power, fairly good handling, not so good steering. Too boosted, most of the electric steering car now being made just can\\'t compare to a good hydraulic system. For its size, it has good trunk space. I can fit my bike after taking off the front wheel. While I miss a manual, I am getting spoiled by the DSG box. Just work those floppy paddles. Car is reasonably priced if you don\\'t load it up. I prefer the stock alcantrara suede. I had to order my car as all dealer stock came with many options. After fixing the weak stuff you\\'ll have a gem. Got my 15-year-old TT as a cheap winter project car:  Back window was unglued.  Roof hydraulics leaked (replaced with gas struts).  About 5 cracked vacuum hoses (hard plastic) caused rough idle.  Front Oxygen sensor bad. Sway bar inserts made cracking noises. Washer fluid leaked.  Serpentine idler bearings bad. Air pump rivets cracked.  Windshield was coming delaminated.  ESP sensor was flaky (easy to disable, 1st year bad design).  All of that stuff (plus new coils, plugs, shocks, etc) was easy to find and ran about $3000 (I did most of the labor).  So now I have a 16-year-old TT that runs great as a daily driver. It\\'s been the most fun 15000 miles I\\'ve ever had, with no signs of stopping.  Make sure the timing belt\\'s been changed, and nobody has used the wrong fluids (it requires special tranny, Haldex, coolant, etc). Wrong fluids will ruin it.  But do it right and you\\'ll have a cheap topless blast that never gets old.  These are destined to become classics.  Just treat it right and it\\'ll reward you.  Seen people with 250,000 miles on them. A car with problems, but if you can live with them The 2001 TT had numerous electrical problems, and mine is no exception. I blame it on the used car dealer I bought it from, who messed up quite a number of things... seems like I have run into a series of issues that are annoying, but not debilitating. Due to turbo lag and AWD it is a bit slow off the line (compared to my old Z car and 79 Trans Am), but the car is very strong in the mountains and on the highway. It is a great cruising car on the open road, and handles well up to about 110 mph. My wife and I got silly while out on the plains of eastern Colorado and tried to find out how fast it was... at 115 it was still accelerating smoothly, but the car started to feel kind of like it was floating, and we lost our nerve. My goal is to actually FIX all the minor problems I have on this car and figure out how it goes when I\\'ve got those sorted out... I refuse to be beaten by this car. It looks terrific, you don\\'t see too many of them any more, and (when it\\'s not driving me nuts with a minor problem) is a pleasure to drive. Experience tells me though, there aren\\'t any \"just okay\" versions of this model year... you either got a good one and are among the huge fans of the car, or you got a money pit you can\\'t wait to get rid of... have a mechanic you trust check the car out carefully, and you can get one heck of a car. I love my Audi TT I\\'m very surprised by most of these reviews. I\\'ve owned mine since 2008 and it was my very first car with 93,000 miles on it. Paid 11,000 for it. It\\'s now at 174,000. Over the course of 7 years I\\'ve replaced the computer, water pump, all hoses, all belts, 1 ball joint and a great deal of the rear suspension. Most of these things I replaced just to do it. The water pump did fail and I\\'ve had many issues with the rear suspension. Over all this car has ran great for me and has been very reliable over all these years. I plan on driving this car until the motor blows up.  Nightmare to own Bought car used, 1st week turbo fell off and the stability control computer failed. Dealer replaced and repaired no charge. After that over 4000 miles had to repair, brakes, tires replaced, timing belt and water pump, oil leaks, fuel lines, all hoses for turbo over $2000 in parts! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND to my worst enemy. Terrible car don\\'t waste your money! Fun car - lots of problems! Bought it new, had it services on schedule every time. Once off warranty, started servicing myself, delving into the car. Problems in build and engine design quality too many to mention, and expensive to repair. Once you fix something, something else fails. Those of you having bought it used wondering if the problem was the \"previous owner\" - nope, we bought it new, meticulously had it maintained under warranty, and it started going to hell in a hand basket nonetheless. Audi\\'s real motto is \"Vorsprung durch SCHLECHTE Technik! (Advancement through BAD technology!)\" Total miles: 36,000 (I\\'m not kidding!) Fun Car - Very Poor Reliability I bought my car with 30,000 miles. At 40,000 miles (5 yrs old) all the problems started. Alternator went bad, serpentine belt replaced four times, tensioner replaced, air sensor, fuel gage gives incorrect reading.  I always have preventative work done to prevent timing belt issues (common).  The car is very fun to drive and well engineered. My newer Infiniti doesn\\'t have all the special features that Audi crammed into this little car. The top goes up and down in about six seconds so I\\'m never caught in the rain.  Having been a Honda/Toyota owner I am disappointed in the reliability of the Audi since it has broken down four times in six years.  Friends Don\\'t Let Friends Buy Audi My 2001 Audi TT Roadster offers great driving performance and very reasonable gas mileage.  Maintenance has been a nightmare.  Let\\'s face it - for a $45,000 machine touted as a marvel of German engineering, much of the workmanship on this car is definitely on the \\'el cheapo\\' side.  Just to mention a few things:  replaced timing belt/tensioner TWICE in 2005 and 2007 ($1400 each time). The power top died in 2005 and I don\\'t want to pay $2000 to replace it so I use manual lower and raise on the top.  Just last week the window in the rear came unglued from the top. This is not really fixable.  Replacement cost: about $3100. Turbo lovers! The 2001 Audi TT 225 quattro is an underdog in my eyes! With the AWD system launching off the line, and putting you into your seat smoothly accelerating from 0-60 in under 7 seconds. For 30,000 dollars I think it\\'s worth every penny. Most of all there are many performance upgrades for the TT. The Audi TT is a car that can meet the needs of anyone who just loves to be noticed or loves to drive! Good looking car I have about 110k on this car now, had several problems, the most serious being the instrument cluster (not covered by Audi) also the rear window melted away from the soft-top with no obvious way to glue it back on. The TT is a good looking car, comfortable and fun to drive with that unique Audi look but with the experience I\\'ve had together with the type of problems I\\'ve had I won\\'t be buying another Audi. Why my TT will be retired to my garage I had engine problems from day one. I was able to overlook this because it was a thrill to drive. When I hit 52000 mi. Audi replaced the engine. Totally happy driver. I now have 110,000 mi. I have a new car ordered but the TT has the garage for keeps. Turbo Charged Ride Great car, however before buying make sure that the electronics for the odometer, fuel tank, speedometer have been replaced. Original uses an Italian chip that costs almost $1800 for a dealer replacement.  Also, the glass wind screen on the convertible has a binding problem on the track that means the entire unit must be replaced at a cost of more than a thousand dollars!  Oh yes, and if the glass is broken there is no replacement, you gotta buy the whole unit.  Aside from the above, it is a great car, great performance, holds the road equally well in rain or snow due to the AWD. I would buy another one for sure. Get the 225hp, not the 180hp. The extra horses make a big difference. Retirement gift Like other owners I have had some repairs but not as serious: lights and winshield wiper fluid reservoir. The major item was the instrument cluster which Audi finally settled the lawsuit. Upgraded shocks, exhaust and intake manifold make the car more fun to drive than ever. Fantastic Car! I love this car! It handles well, drives well, looks awesome, easy to use, plenty of space for big guys (im 6\\'3\" 300lbs) I would absolutely recommend this car to anyone. The car isn\\'t too bad on maintanance and up keep.  Fun, disappointing reliability Fun to drive, handles nicely. But problems problem problems. Too cost conscious in engineering - will never buy Audi again. Stuff that should not happen at below 35,000 miles, and don\\'t happen to my Benz with 120,000 miles! Too many problems to list - bearings, turbo, brake disks, joint boots, instrument panel, rain leaks frying electronics, O2 sensor, all at less than 35k miles! And I\\'m told by one of my mechanics it\\'s one of the less troublesome recent Audis! It\\'s a blast. Purchased used just over 2 years ago, had 40K miles. I added 26K miles and only had a mass air flow sensor fail. This Quattro is great fun stock but if you have the money I highly recommend 18\" rims with 235/40ZR 18 tires, cross drilled & vented rotors all around with ceramic brake pads. Also recommend perf chip and machined piston diverter valve. Now it\\'s an absolute blast to drive. Even if you don\\'t do any of the above invest in the diverter valve, the stock part is a poor design and inefficient causing turbo lag while shifting. And for heavens sake change the timimg belt every 60K miles and at the same time change over to a water pump w/metal impeller and v-belt tensioner w/metal roller. Buyer Beware Consider the TT a hole that you will pour lots of money into.  The reliability is horrible, and the repairs extremely expensive. Smooth TT My Audi TT is joy to drive!  I purchased my TT in Mar 2006 with 36,000 miles.  The handling is amazing!  The turbo lag takes getting use to; however, once you master the intricacies of driving the TT you will truly enjoy the full driving experience. Lot\\'s of Fun! This may be the best used car I\\'ve ever bought.  Like another ad I saw recently, when I turn this car on, THIS one definitely returns the favor. Lots of fun in Quattro.  Solid fun in the curves, rain, & snow. Compliments are plenty. I haven\\'t had any bad maintenence issues yet.  My only complaint is oil leaks.  I suggest changing the timing belt early at 60K, along with the oil seals, water pump, etc.  Then drive it another 60K like you stole it!  Amazing in all weather I got the TT in may, loving the summer usability, and the AWD makes it drivable year round.  I am in Colorado and we have had a BAD winter so far this year, and I have not had a single day I had any trouble!  Wonderful all around, I couldn\\'t have picked a better car! Fun Car, Expensive to Maintain Great car, fun to drive, looks great, but there have been many repair issues, far more than I would have expected for this level of car. A mint condition Audi sports car This car is fun to drive with a \"turbo\" boost. It looks like a new one and drives like one also. New snow tires make this all wheel drive one that goes in the winter unlike some sports cars you need to park for 6 months. Total original miles is 23,400. Garage kept makes it a Beauty! Fun Car! This is a great car.  My first convertible. The power roof is easy and quick, I can drop it down or put it up easily at a stop light.  I have also had an issue with the squeak/clunky noise that a couple other reviewers noticed but it hasn\\'t caused any major issues.  I have had a couple expensive repairs with the water pump and oil gaskets and such. but it\\'s been basically very reliable.  and it\\'s a beautiful car! My favorite is the baseball leather interior, makes the car stand out from all the other black leather-clad interiors of comparable cars. Looks great on the flatbed. Problems too numerous to list but Audi 1.8T motors have well known timing belt failure issues that cause major engine damage. Failure typically occurs well before 90,000 service interval. research A4 class action lawsuit. Expensive to buy, insure, maintain and, most of all, repair. Too many computer chips and sensors that fail regularly. I have been left stranded on the roadside twice in 6 months by serious mechanical failures that were expensive to repair. Don\\'t buy one as a primary vehicle. Definitely don\\'t buy one used. Better yet, don\\'t buy one at all.  I have owned mine for two years and it has had 5 or 6 significant repairs that required me to drive a loaner or rental car for a few days Hot, stylish ride I\\'ve loved this car since the day I bought it. Cruising through winding mountain roads with the top down can be a thrill or a pleasure depending on the weight of my foot. And to get great gas mileage (30 mpg) is the icing on the cake. Fun, fun, fun. TT Roadster I went from a 1992 BMW 318I convertable to the Audi TT. My wife and I were in the market for a sport convertable and we fell in love with the ride, performance and just plain fun of driving this car. The car has been very reliable and trouble free. I will definitely buy another one when it\\'s time to replace this car. Love my TT This is the most fun I have had driving, ever. I look forward to an hour commute back and forth to work when I can drive the Audi. The handling is exceptional. I never have a worry. Looks Looks Looks !!! I purchased this car about 6 months ago Certified Used and i LOVE it ! The best part is that you are driving a car that is great looking and very rare so people look at you and your car and they don\\'t know what kind it is and admire. Superb handling, good performance (not an M3), do 100 mph and you won\\'t notice it.   Major repair every 4 months A very comfortable and fun car to drive, but the most unreliable car I\\'ve owned since the \\'48 Dodge pickup that I bought for $50 in 1973.  A lot of the problems were with the turbo system, but also had both cooling fans, catalytic converter, wiring harness in door, instrument cluster, fuel sensors in tank all replaced before the car had 50,000 miles.  I purchased this car new and it was never wrecked.   Fun car This is a fun car to own and drive, it attracts attention where ever you drive it.  The handling with the AWD is exciting on backroads. Once you go German, you never go back... I think this story sums it up.  I was recently getting lunch at a deli shortly after I washed and waxed my TT when I heard a gentleman behind me say to his friend, \"Did you see that Audi out there, what a sweet car.\" It suffers from turbo lag, but once out of first, it\\'s not noticeable.  I live in Colorado, so the AWD is a nice feature for a roadster.  It also has plenty of power over the mountain passes and is a constant head turner.  A fantastic car! Avoid Audis! I own a 2001 TT Roadster convertible.  Nothing but problems:  failed transaxle, water leaks and rattles, performance problems, failed instrument cluster -- all with less than 23,000 miles!!  Audi has not been helpful in resolving out-of-warranty problems.  For instance, discovered at 22,000 miles --  due to severely abnormal tire wear -- that rear axle was bent when installed at the factory.  Audi insists that damage due to \"external factors,\" but dealer admits it takes a serious impact to bend the axle -- which has never happened in my possession.  Out of warranty -- Audi\\'s \"Customer Advocates\" are powerless to help, even though they agree that it is improbable that I caused the damage. TT Has Been a Super Car  I have had my TT since 2001, and still love to drive it.  The styling still gets nods of approval from people in the street, the styling really is unique.  Overall I have been happy with the car, it does have a few interior squeaks here and there, and some minor electrical issues occurred, but it\\'s a very solid car.   Great car! 225 hp prob. better choice I love my Audi TT drives smooth, you only have to have maintenance every 10k miles There is one problem that upsets me about the car, it seems there is something loose on the driver side. When you hit let\\'s say a pot hole or something or even just cruising it\\'s like a creaking sound very annoying. Overall excellent car, it\\'s a head turner, Especially with the top down, its quick and reliable. Oh I wish there was an in-dash cd (would make life a little easier.) Other than that LOVE IT!!!! Emotional Attachment My 2001 Audi TT at the time was by far the \\rbiggest head turner of all cars not \\rnamed Ferrari or Lamborghini, and it \\rcost a heck of a lot less.  The driving \\rexperience is superb due to the way it \\rmakes me feel, rather than the \\rindividual parts.  The TT is by no means \\ra performance ace.  There is noticeable turbo \\rlag, and it goes 0-60 in 7.5 or so, but it feels \\rfaster.  Its lateral grip is excellent, \\ralthough not comparable to the sportier \\rPorsche Boxster or Honda S2000.  Overall, \\rthe car feels sportier than it actually \\ris.  The real winner is the design, both \\rinternally and externally. There are \\rsome creaks that are rather annoying at \\rtimes, however, and I had to take it in \\rfor two minor and one major service. new to me Love the car.  It is the perfect car for Hawaii.   Art on wheels I have shared this car with my\\rson-in-law for the past 4 years. We both\\rloved it.  While not the greatest in\\racceleration, the car has a fun and\\rlooks rating higher than anything either\\rof us have driven in the last 50 years.\\r Don\\'t buy one if you need lots of cargo\\rroom but that is what sport utes are\\rfor, not sports cars. So much fun! I used to have a Miata many years ago \\rand went through two JEEP Grand \\rCherokees before going back to a \\rconvertible, but I absolutely love the \\rTT.  It is so much fun to drive and \\ramazingly, it is much bigger than I had \\rexpected.  There are a ton of hidden \\rcompartments and storage spaces.  I am \\ra big fan of the safety features in \\rthis car as well as the fact that it \\rgets great gas mileage (well, compared \\rto a JGC).  :) Concept Car Brought To Life This is one of the most beuatiful cars \\rto ever roll off the assembly line.\\rThe interior (especially with the \\rbaseball optic leather) is flat-out \\rgorgeous!  This car, while not a hard-\\rcore sports car, can still deliver 85% \\rof the performance of a Prosche 911 S4 \\rCabriolet at less than 1/2 the price - \\rand it has a better interior with more \\rroom for front passengers.  Much better \\roverall car than Z4 or SLK.  Better \\rergonimics than Boxster or 911.  More \\rroom and better performance than \\rMiata.  Best bang for the buck - all \\rthings considered.

I have since dropped the \\rcar an inch using Eibach Springs and \\radded 18\" wheels.  I have also \\rinstalled an Alpine Head Unit featuring \\rXM radio.  I have not had any issues \\rwith the car. It is solid and fun to \\rdrive.  It\\'s looks are unique and \\rstriking. Kudos to Audi! Audi TT While it isn\\'t a Porsche, it\\'s a great \\rsports car.  And living in the Midwest \\rI love it in the winter...with winter \\rsnow tires I\\'ve never had a problem \\rwith snow; it\\'s as sure footed as a \\rmountain goat.  With Z rated summer \\rtires it\\'s more fun to drive than \\ranything I\\'ve been in before. Awesome Roadster This is one awesome vehicle!

Fuel \\reconomy is about 30MPG on the highway \\rand it is quite the head-turner. This \\ris my third Audi, and reliability has \\rbeen outstanding with all three cars. Vehicle as Art My Audi TT has the baseball glove \\rinterior, xenon headlights, and special \\rwheels.  The overall effect is unlike \\rany vehicle in its price range for \\rartful syling. I test drove the Porsche \\rBoxster but was VERY disappointed in \\rthe interior styling. \\r I wanted a vehicle that would provide \\rme a wonderful driving experience along \\rwith a beautiful/artistic interior.  \\rThe Audi TT Quattro convertible \\rprovided me both thse characteristics I \\rsought. great ca have owned everything: ferrari, \\rporsche, bmw, mercedes...this is the \\rbest of the lot.

Have been thru curves rated\\r25mph at 65+. Nothing but pure fun in\\rthe mountains, even  with snow/rain. I\\rput on Blizzak tires in the winter. No\\rproblem anywhere   I went. The TT may\\rnot be the fastest car off the block,\\rbut it is no lagger either.   Very tight\\rall over. The design is great, turns\\rheads were ever I go.   You constantly\\rhave people waving at you and hollering\\r\"what a cool car\".  Only problem I have\\rhad is trying to get a base luggage rack\\rto carry my skis and bike.  \\rRecommend it to anyone who wants a\\rreally fun machine. Great Car!!! Have owned my TT Roadster for almost 1 \\ryear.  225 HP, Quattro model.  During \\rthe year have logged over 20,000 miles \\rwith absolutely no problems.  \\rConstantly asked by people in the \\rparking lots about the car.  It is a \\reye-catcher.  Acceleration is great, \\rthough I wish first gear was a bit \\rlonger.  Handles like no other car I \\rhave owned (though the Z-rated Pilot \\rSports only made it 18,000 miles).  \\rInterior room is better than you might \\rthink.  I am 6-1 and no problems with \\rcomfort or fatigue.  Have taken a 5 \\rhour trip in the car and could have \\rgone for a few more hours. the real TT review FYI: TT stands for \"Tourist Trophy\"     \\r    Out of the many choices i had \\r(S2000, Boxter, SLK 320, and Z3 3.0) \\rthe audi proved to be the winner.  \\r   Nothing beets the all wheel drive \\rquattro system, in no other car, i have \\ri felt so incontrol (everychance i get, \\rwhile in the pouring rain, ill speed \\rup, rather than slow down.  \\r    Let her rip.  To hear the turbo \\rspoon and the exhaust roar, makes \\rothers wonder, \"Is that stock?\" \\r    Audi seems to be the hidden treasure \\rin the automotive industry.  But all it \\rtakes is one test drive and you\\'ll be \\rsold.\\r TT Roadster Love my car.  Drive it everywhere, all \\rthe time.  Never put the top up. Love it! Great car!  Love the ride and the interior.  Great looks! Thoroughly Fantastic I\\'ve read reviews that speak of all the problems, so let me get my gripes out of the way first:-The interior ergonomics are weird.  I\\'m constantly adjusting my seat to get comfortable, and something as minor as a different set of shoes will throw off my entire driving position.  -The electronic components do, as said, degrade.  But as long as they don\\'t fail, it\\'s more of an irritation than a problem.  No, I can\\'t see all of the pixels on my trip computer and no, I don\\'t care.-The timing belt issue is real.  Pay attention to it, or you\\'re a fool otherwise.  But really, this boils down to simple, diligent maintenance.I bought mine at an auction house for around $8k in 2013.  It was cheaper to insure than the Subaru I\\'d been looking at, and did better in almost every category except passenger and storage space, which I didn\\'t really care about.  The previous owner had maintained it meticulously - he just didn\\'t do a good job paying for it.  When I got it, the ABS control module was out, so I had no ABS and no traction control system.  I have never bothered to fix this problem.  It\\'s better with standard brakes, human judgment and a fantastic set of tires.  Up in Montana where I am, we have janky roads and freakish weather.  This car handles great in all weather conditions: running Nokian winter tires (no studs) in winter - excellent traction on snow and ice and Hankook tires in summer getting over 40mpg.  The steering is so excellent and responsive it\\'s almost hard to cope with when I step into it from my truck (which has 90\\'s GM steering).  The clutch is very forgiving, if a bit stiff, and I don\\'t think it\\'s very easy to stall, either.  Sound system is bang on.This is an amazing car for a driver with the right mindset.  I don\\'t think I\\'d pay the price for it new, but as a pre-owned vehicle, I\\'ve never been happier. Audi TT my dream car!  2001 No repairs aside for maintenance for over ten years.  Recently put 6000 into it, transmission and instrument Pannel, now like new again! Great little car most new cars still can\\'t compete I\\'ve owned my TT Quattro coupe since 2006. Bought it used from a guy that was as meticulous with it as I am. The only issue was the timing belt. it let go and cost a good chunk to get the engine rebuilt (my fault for not changing it sooner)... better than new now. If you are looking for one, ask for receipts on repairs/upkeep!In the 9 years I\\'ve owned it... I\\'ve replaced or rebuilt: engine, fuel pump (very spendy there), drive lines, rotors and the water pump(this has plastic impellers from the factory - change out for metal impeller pump). Total about 6K in repairs... but waaay worth it. I know what issues it has had and what has been repaired... no new \\'can of worms\\' in some other used luxury sports car! It is at 124K miles now and should last me another 145K easy! Close to 30 mpg on the highway, 24-26 in the city (depending on my driving tendencies).I still get people staring and asking about it. I have the Black/black quattro. People are blown away when i tell them it is a 2001! 14 years old and still looks better and drives better than most cookie cutter \\'sports cars\\' put out these days. Not to mention the gas mileage is equal to or better than most 2015 models!Tis a great date night car with the wife. She still gets all giddy when i \\'let\\' her drive it! Do not buy! This is a very fun to drive and very cute sporty car but it\\'s not worth the trouble. I\\'ve owned this car 2 years and replaced the temperature sensor twice and the temperature housing. I\\'ve replaced all 4 tires, water pump, alternator, battery, shift rod, and had the transmission rebuilt. It kept blowing fuses I\\'d have to dig in and replace every few weeks. The oil change is expensive. I\\'ve spent more on this car than it\\'s worth just trying to maintain it. It just spent literally 2 months in the shop for the shift rod and transmission with parts being on back order and so on. The phrase \"cost an arm and a leg\" does not begin to cover it. This car has cost me my soul! It is the devil.  Can\\'t believe it I have read every review, looked at so many different cars and got lucky enough to find this one. I had heard of problems with the car, but in the 6 years that we have had it, it is the best car I ever owned.  Knock on wood, frequent oil changes and a timing belt change have been my only expenses.  It gets great mileage, is all wheel drive and can haul plenty of stuff. I now have 142,000 miles on it and it looks as good as the day we picked it up from the dealership.  When I tell people the how old it is, they cannot believe.  I have had a Boxster, miata, Nissan 350Z and this is still my favorite. Is it the fastest or best handling, no, but it looks great and performs well. Fun while it lasted I had my 2001 225 quattro for a little over 4 years and it was a fun, sporty car used as a daily driver (New England weather was no problem for it with some snow tires). However things started to go wrong around 60k and it was in and out of the shop for one thing or another during my last year of ownership. Small problems like faulty sensors and door locks not working to control arms breaking and some engine problems. Finally got rid of it when, at only 68k, the timing belt snapped and the top end was destroyed. I did buy it second hand with 23k on it so that could have played a huge roll since I have no idea how the previous owner treated it. Overall, good car, just have to take care of it. Disappointing & Unreliable Bought my TT certified/pre-owned.  Enjoyed the car for almost a year and then the saga began.  Towed to the dealership at least 3 times ($200 a pop),  had to take it in for oil and coolant leaks twice,  had to flush cooling system 3 times, overheating issues, mass flow air sensor broke,  immobilizer for keyless remote needed to be reprogrammed, ac stopped working, fan broke, speed sensor broke 1 mile after leaving service.  These weren\\'t even general maintenance!! Can\\'t believe I had to waste so much time and energy for this car. A beautiful speed machine! For the money, this is the best sports car on the road hands down. I\\'ve had this car (225HP-Quatro-AWD) almost 7 years now, and I\\'ve only had very minor issues. Looks incredible, and performs almost as well as it\\'s looks. I drive it in NYC/NJ/CT, and it can handle the road(one of the worst infrastructures around) as well as all the bad drivers due to its speed and handling. Performs very well in poor conditions, but I would recommend snow tires for extreme conditions. Good room, solid storage for its size, but you won\\'t be able to fit an adult in the back seat. Very well built and durable. I\\'m 6\\'3\" 225 and I\\'m very comfortable in it. Nice amenities-sound-seats-dash-controls-very user friendly! Huge pain, continually in the auto shop This car is pretty fun to drive, but I have had to bring it to the shop a minimum of 5 times EACH year that I\\'ve owned it. Aside from the irritation of continually having to schedule appts and be without my car, the European parts are expensive and an hour-long diagnostic is required before ANYTHING can be fixed.  End result:  even to replace a $20 brake light switch, there is a $90 charge for the diagnostic before anything is done for the car.  Because Audi was trying to be so artistic with this car, it\\'s a pain to do even the smallest thing such as putting on the spare tire and if you have a blowout once the tires are below a certain tread depth, you have to replace all 4 tires. The Best I\\'ve had my Audi TT for just about 6 years and it has been a dream.  I\\'m a drummer playing for small trios, amazingly I can fit my entire drum kit in the back if I put the back seats down and very comfortably.   I get more compliments on this car than any of my previous. Avoid this car. I have owned this car for over three years now. I have replaced or repaired the following: 2 o2 sensors ($750), MAF sensor ($400), timing belt & fuel pump ($600), CV boot X2 ($200), fuel sending unit ($675), both power windows motors ($1050), exhaust manifold ($1400), headlight bulbs X2 ($275), oil leak ($150), vacuum leak ($275), instrument cluster ($900).... there are other repairs I have done.... but just can\\'t recall right now. Add it up, it is about $7000 in repairs. Take my advice, this car is unreliable and normal repairs are very expensive. Avoid this car!! WAY too many maintenance issues I\\'ve owned this TT since February of 2002, and I would estimate that I\\'ve already had to take it into the dealer to be repaired at least 30 times - and this is not an exaggeration.  It\\'s a fun car with good styling but if I had to do it all over again, I\\'d buy a different car.  Inflated european repair costs aside, it\\'s a royal pain to have to bring this car to the dealership over & over again. There weren\\'t many comparable options when I bought my TT...but now that there are, I\\'m planning to sell mine and buy a japanese sports car instead so that I can spend more time driving it and less time leaving it at a repair shop. Fun but not without issues Bought my TT in Dec 03 with 39000 miles on it. Quick off the line and handled great but the car was constantly at the dealer. The issues I had: rear trunk lock broke, replaced rear deck lid, window motors replaced twice, turbo failed 5 times, a/c compressor went out twice and entire a/c system replaced-interior panels broke during removal and were replaced. New battery, alternator and O2 sensor. Multiple rattles and car would shake at idle especially when a/c on-dealer could not fix. Glove box broke but not covered under warranty- $900. Brakes under warranty $2000 and timing belt service $1700-found water pump leaking. Just got rid of because assured warranty up. TT Quattro Coupe This is the most wonderful car on the road.  It rates, to me, first class in everything. Drive one for yourself.  The price is worth the car.  I constantly have strangers come up to me and ask what kind of car it is. Solid and fun but won\\'t satisfy purists Car feels incredibly solid and tank-like.  This and other heavy hardware make for a heavy car.  Handling is tight but understeers too much and doesn\\'t transmit enough feel, same can be said for the steering and brakes. The engine is a mixed bag... truly fantastic midrange power from 2200-5500rpm, but gutless outside of that range when the turbo is not at full boost at low rpm and inefficient at high rpm, also MUCH less power in hot weather - not a true sports car engine really. Great gas mileage, 30mpg sometimes, averaging 25mpg.  Interior is very nice, but no standard CD player and the seatbelts are very hard to reach. Overall a solid car that\\'s fun to about 80% of its potential. Great bang for the buck... After deciding to replace my VW, I decided to \\rtry and get one of my \\'dream-cars,\" the Audi TT.\\rSpeaking with friends and trying their cars, combined with \\rfamilarity with the A4 convinced me to research the \\rAudi further.  After two months of research and \\rhunting down the exact color, mileage, and price, \\rand I couldn\\'t be happier (do the hunt, it\\'s worth it \\rin the end to get the exact ride you want).  You \\rreally can find this car at the right price. The car is \\ran  unbelievable value, it\\'s fast, torquey, handles like \\ra dream, corners like its on rails, is comfortable, \\rand just looks awesome.  Everybody looks twice at \\rthis car, even if they\\'re looking at your taillights as \\ryou pull away. 2001 Audi TT - Great Car I have received tons of compliments on my 2001 Audi\\rTT 225 quattro since I first purchased it. This car is \\rfour years old now and I still get looks in it. It delivers\\rgreat performance with its 225HP twin intercooled \\rturbo, 5V per cyl engine.  Witrh the all wheel drive, \\rit has it all. Great car to own, though has some quirks I\\'ve owned several Audi\\'s, and come to \\rbelieve that design is more important \\rthan quality from this manufacturer. \\rDon\\'t get me wrong, this car is more \\rfun to drive than any I have ever \\rowned. However, it rattles a bit and \\rcould have used more time getting all \\rthe kinks out before production. Audi \\rdoes not admit they made a mistake, \\rjust that their car\\'s have \"certain \\rcharacteristics\". Mixed bag... :( Awesome car if you approach it as a \\rnice looking sporty car! Far from a \\rreal sports car. My 16 year old M3 can \\rrun circles around it except in a \\rstraight line!!!\\r  Resale value makes me want to never \\rget an Audi ever. My first and last \\rAudi ever. Fun while it lasted, but I \\rcan\\'t afford to buy a car at $40K and \\rsell it at $16K every 3 years. Much \\rbetter value as a used car!!!! Better all the time It\\'s been 3 years since I bought my TT \\rand I am very pleased, overall.  My \\rgreen TT is dependable, comfortable, \\rsmooth, hip, fun and fast.  It is still \\rthe best looking car on the road and \\rthe interior still delights. I put on 4 \\rsnows in the winter and she\\'s a great \\rall weather (snow) car.   She\\'s quick \\roff the line and it\\'ll cruise \\rcomfortably at 120 if I\\'m so inclined. \\rIt\\'ll go 140 if you\\'re crazy.   Plus... \\rkids love it and I have gotten \\raccustomed to kids at red lights \\rcalling to me about my great car.   Just Plain Fun I love this car. Having owned many \\rAmercian made muscle cars and sports \\rcars, the ride, performance and \\rstyling of the Audi has made me in a \\rconvert to German made cars only!  Great Car Fun to drive, maintenance free, and \\rgreat design.  Only issue with vehicle \\rwas power at lower speeds.  The new \\r250HP models fixes this. Not what I expected I\\'ve owned this car less than 1 year \\rand I\\'m already selling it.  In that \\rtime the Mass Air flow sensor \\rmalfunctioned, the instrument cluster \\rdied, the remote works when it wants, \\rand the dealer stripped my oil drain \\rplug and blamed it on my local \\rmechanic.  I won\\'t be buying another \\rAudi. A REAL 10! I\\'ve been driving an Audi TT 225 \\rQuattro Coupe for almost three years \\rnow.  I have had nothing but pleasure \\rfrom it!  Not a single problem other \\rthan those I caused myself by driving \\rtoo fast!  It corners like it is on \\rrails!  Everyone loves it.  I get 28 \\rmpg, driving like a fool most of the \\rtime. style only owned a short time so i know \\rnothing of reliablility, but the \\rinterior and exterior are a knockout. a  Porsche Speedster for Less $$$$$ I bought the car new to be a winter  Little Bump Expensive Repairs It\\'s a great car to drive, just make \\rsure you don\\'t bump any wheel stops \\rin Mall parking lots. My little bump\\ris going to cost $1,500 to fix. I had\\ra Z3 and didn\\'t have this problem. Fun, when it\\'s not broken I was so excited when I bought my TT! \\rGreat looks, 225hp and all wheel drive \\rwhat more could I ask for? How about a \\rcar that can run more than a few weeks \\rwithout something going wrong with it. \\rI have had nothing but problems with my \\rTT!! Some of the problems include: \\rchronic noise/rattles, front-end \\rproblems so severe that after four \\rvisits they finally replaced everything \\rto remedy the original problem, anti-\\rlock brake problems, turbo problems, \\roil leaks and even the CD changer \\rbroke. All of this and only 26000 \\rmiles. The best $40,000.00 I ever spent \\r(sarcasm)I should have bought four \\rHyundai\\'s! Don\\'t make the same mistake \\rI made....... avoid Audi!! ettp The TT is not the most extreme \\rperformer in its class, but it does \\rmore things well at once than any \\rcompetitor.  It can keep up with 99% \\rof sports cars on the tight twisties, \\rbut it is also a pleasure to drive for \\rhundreds of miles and many hours on \\rend.  It is also the only car in its \\rclass that is likely to end up in an \\rart museum for its design alone.  Put \\rthis all together and no other car \\rcomes close. Fun car, but more rattles than a maraca I loved, absolutely loved my Audi TT. Great \\rride, handled beautifully, absolutely \\rWONDERFUL performance with the 225 HP \\r1.8T - I never had a moment where I wished \\rthe car had MORE power. Grip was wonderful \\rin the snow, the interior design was absolutely \\rclassic.\\r However, I eventually had to sell it due to just \\rtoo many recurring rattles that made it feel \\rlike you were driving a vehicle much cheaper \\rthan you were. TT coupe quattro This car was and continues to be a real  Funsville, USA The turbo and the quattro the key to \\rthe performance.  It leaps between 2nd, \\r3rd and 4th. Cruises effortlessly at 90-\\r95 in 5th.  And takes long mountain \\rcurves at 90+ like its nailed to the \\rroad.  \\r Was going to buy the classic silver, if \\rI got it new, but then saw the new \\rcolors; this one is denim blue, or as I \\rprefer VOODOO BLOO.\\r Plan to rechip it to take HP from 225 \\rto 265, add a diverter valve to get rid \\rof turbo lag, and may redo the air \\rintake and exhaust.  \\r Am actually trying to find a way to \\rrace this thing. Any ideas out there???? best this is the best car in the world. bar  Tons of Fun! Great car, nothing but tons of fun on \\rthe roadways.  After three years of \\rbeing on the market, the body style is \\rstill unique and catches the eye and \\rapproval of all.  Easily fits two sets \\rof golf clubs in back which make it a \\rvery practical sports car.  The TT does \\rnot have the same raw quickness and \\rfeel as a frind\\'s BMW Z3 3.0 , but not \\rmany cars do.  The TT certainly has \\renough get up and go and roadhugging \\rguts to satify all but the most \\rexperienced and trained drivers.  \\rSecond and third gearswhen pushed \\rthrough the 2000-6000 RPM range is \\rquite a rush.

Overall, a fun car to drive \\rand the design is as momumental as an \\rJag  XK120. I disagree with some of the \\reditor ratings- excellent storage for \\rthis type of car. Slightly regret not \\rhaving gotten the 225hp. TTrific A lot of the so-called expert reviewers \\rknock the TT for performance \\r(especially compared to peers such as \\rthe S2000). However,I think the car \\rperforms incredibly well for the avg. \\rroad driver and you\\'re likely to be \\rthrilled unless your an F-1 driver. \\rThe  style and quality of construction \\rhave been well documented and there is \\rno doubt in my mind that the TT is an \\rinstant classic destined to appreciate \\rin value over the long-term.

But \\rwith the seats down i was able to fit \\rin all four off my street tires when i \\rhad my tires and wheels changed for \\rwinter. Best Car Ever After having owned a BMW 635 and BMW M5  Zero defects over 18 months & 17000 mile Perhaps the most practical sports car in\\rthe market. Folding down the rear seats\\rand opening the hatch of my coupe\\rallowed me to transport a 25\" TV (in the\\rsales box!) Incredibly comfortable seats\\rand quiet cabin, as proven in a 28-hour\\rtrip (2 drivers). Highly responsive\\rsteering and braking. Automated HVAC\\rrapidly cools car from 100F and heats\\ralmost as fast from 10F.  HID lighting\\ris the best I\\'ve experienced in a stock\\rsystem. The quattro system with Dunlop\\rWinter Sport tyres make you scoff at\\rsnow storms (try that in a Boxster or\\rM3). This is my 6th Audi (and 2nd TT)\\rsince 1975 and the best of the bunch. Fun This is a fun car.  I don\\'t know what \\rpeople are complaining about--it\\'s a \\rsports car.  It\\'s small!  It\\'s not a \\rCaddy.  It\\'s going to be hard to get \\rinto. My big problem in 15000 miles is \\ra seat belt that catches and squeeking \\rwindshield wipers, both fixed \\rimmediately.  My dealer, Premier Motors \\rin Albuquerque, has been terriffic.  No \\rproblems with their service at all.  \\rI\\'m very happy with my TT.  I wouldn\\'t \\rtrade it for anyting else. TT= Tempermental transportation! I have owned the car for less than a \\ryear and it has been in the shop 2 1/2 \\rweeks. Audi has replaced the electronic \\rcentral locking system, the instrument \\rcluster twice (it is still not working \\rproperly), both horns, both window \\rmotors, the turbo bi valve, and had to \\rfix many rattles and creaks. I love the \\rcar but am quite frustrated with it and \\rI doubt if I can afford to keep it past \\rthe warranty period. This was going to \\rbe my dream car but it has turned into a \\rnightmare. The Audi corporation is \\rvirtually no help. I am glad I have a \\rgood dealer. They are as frustrated as I \\ram with the problems of the car.  Great \\rdesign, poor e Dissappointed I love the style and design and the \\rinterior touches.  Too bad you have to \\rbe a contortionist to get in and out of \\rthe car.  \\r The seats are unconfortable, the cup \\rholders useless, and the suspension \\rcreaks like an old lady every time you \\rgo over a speed bump at 3 MPH.\\r Someone tried to steal my car ( too bad \\rthey didn\\'t succeed).  The ignition \\rsystem was dammaged.  It only took 2 \\rmonths to get a duplicate coded key \\rfrom the Audi factory - all the way in \\rGermany.  It cost me $2,000 in rental \\rcar fees waiting for the parts.\\r  But a BMW 5 series and forget the TT- \\ror make me an offer and yo can have a \\rsilver 225 turbo.  Fire sale! Solid, great all-around car! Pros: Power 2200-5800 rpm, tight handling, killer brakes, gorgeous style, solid feel, safe, AWD, flashing  brights back at people who think HID\\'s are high-beams.\\rCons: Less balanced than a Boxster, loses power 6000+ rpm, limited visibility, rain water on rear window, no CD player standard in a $38000 car, cupholder placement (all these are niggles).  MountainScott, the car is a single turbo NOT a twin-turbo.  TT does not stand for twin turbo.  \"Go in knowing what you\\'re getting,\" as you say. In Love I would never consider myself a car fanatic but I couldn´t help but to fall in love with the sleek, sexy, TT. I just bought one and I drive it to make long commutes along the California highways. I honestly smile every time I see it. Driving it is a real pleasure. I am so crazy about it to the point that my husband jokingly asked me just not to  start praying to it! :D  Couldn\\'t be happier with my Roadster! great vehicle - had a tough time finding the color combo (white & navy blue) I wanted here on the east coast (they stopped making the white ...so I had to search the country for a \\'leftover\\' in 2004).  Have been VERY pleased with performance, reliability, appearance.  I bought it as a second/fun car, but I find I use it ALL the time (leaving my Mercedes SUV sitting in the garage most days)! TT is a GREAT car I\\'m 6\\' 6\", 245lbs., when a friend suggested I try a TT, I couldnt believe I could fit in it! I had a Cadillac Seville STS, and the TT has the same amount of legroom. The handling is incredible, and it\\'s no slouch when it comes to performance. I have beaten my share of Porsche Boxster S\\'s. I have gone through a set of tires. I\\'ve taken the car on the track at Talledega, and it is a joy to drive. I have not had any mechanical or body problems with the car. Exceeded my expecations. This Audi TT has exceeded my expectations in all aspects. It is fun and easy to drive, I was not looking for a super high performance Porsche 911. The quality of the interior work is flawless, fantastic leather seating along with really innovative styling. In my opinion it is designed in a true roadster style, it is not meant for a family vehicle. There is enough room for my wife and I to each pack a bag and go away for the weekend. I started to use the TT as my daily commute, not my original intent, it was just to be a weekend fun car. I have Ocean Blue with the Vanilla interior, what a great combination. It also has heated seats, CD changer, homelink and xenon headlights.  I LOVE this CAR!! This car is FABULOUS!  I traded a BMW 5 series for my little TT and it was the best thing I\\'ve ever done! There isn\\'t a day go by that I don\\'t tell my husband \"I LOVE THIS CAR!\"  Who knew a car could be this fun to drive!?! The TT is a head turner with great \\'get up and go\\' Did I mention I LOVE THIS CAR?! Love is this... After I got this car as a gift from my parents I was excited. They had to suffer because on weekends instead of going home, I take long trips to unknown places in Texas. I just love how I can trust this car in the middle of nowhere. No one can take it from me. This car is a magic on the empty highways on middle Texas. I am taking this car to Seattle from Austin, TX in two days and looking forward to the fun I will have. Just a delight, you will love how the world looks from the inside of this beauty. Believe me, you will fall in love with this car even if you don\\'t want to. Fun to drive by excellence Very powerful, fun to drive, very exclusive design, one of the best third car you can imagine to drive on the sunshine Fun to Drive This car is just so much fun to drive and there is not that many on the road so it is unique as well. Still a head turner-- I Love my 2005 Audi TT.  I switched from BMW 330 and haven\\'t regretted it. I have not experienced any problems since I drove out of dealership eight months ago. It is quick and really performs once you reach 80 mph. It offers superb handling and braking ability. I can\\'t wait for the 2006 model. Fabulous car My 2005 Audi TT is the nicest car that I have ever driven. It handles beautifully, both on road and highway. I have total control, even at high speeds. I wouldn\\'t change a thing but the coffee holder, which is in a lousy location. I can\\'t wait for nicer weather, so I can take the top down. So far so good in the snow and rain, which is a big relief here in Chicago. I\\'m glad that I bought this automobile! Good ... not great. This is my second TT. The first was a dream, the second has been a bit disappointing, with minor problems requiring service. Overall handling has improved, but I\\'ve driven other sports cars with better handling. Excellent braking, even in the rain. First gear is a bit sluggish, but you can really kick it in other gears. Interior comfort is excellent for a two-seater and the well-designed top keeps exterior noise to a minimum. Wind levels with the top down are poor at highway speeds, but that\\'s the price you pay for a ragtop. Audi continues to struggle with exterior finish quality. The finish is uneven and scratches and chips easily. Overall, it is a fun drive and a real attention getter. 2005 Audi TT - Love It My husband bought me this car (2005 Audi TT Roadster) because I\\'ve had my eye on it for the past 5 years....drooling with every look.  I always told him if he left me a widow, I would use the insurance money to buy myself a TT roadster.  He finally decided rather than wish himself dead, he\\'d rather live to see me enjoy the car! Anyway, we got our silver bullet in November 2004 and its lived up to ALL of my expectations.  I am totally in love with this car (can one really love sheet metal?? YOU BET!) Its the most fun you can have driving!  I love the Tiptronic tranny .. being able to choose manual or auto is da bomb!! The Best  I have owned every high end car one can drive. The BMW 3-, 5-, and 7-Series, Lexus, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and this is my favorite car. Aside from the heads turning when you pass by, this car is a blast to drive. The handling is similar to a BMW, you feel safe, the interior is what you expect from a sports car. After four years this car with 50,000 miles still looks new inside and out. If you want to feel alive this is the car to drive. Audi TT roadster Great ride. All wheel drive with regular tires great in rain/snow. New tiptronic is a blast. Hope no design problems with this new system as dealer just had to replace transmission. First to second gear was grinding with only 9000 miles on car. Tiptronic stays in gear past red line and doesn\\'t change, be careful. Audi Excellence The \\'05 Audi TT is a truly exemplory car. It\\ris a supurb driverr\\'s car with outstanding handling.\\rThe Quattro drive must be experienced \\rto be believed .  It is like riding on a \\rtrack no matter the rain conditions. It \\ris strongly recommended that a sports \\rcar winter tire be used durng snow \\rseason, e.g. Blizzak. With those tires, \\reven the Audi convertible is a great \\ryear round car in most regions. AUDI TT Performance This car is extraordinary in ever respect. While the curb weight errs on the heavy side, most of the weight reflects safety features rarely found in a sports car. A sound trade off given the acceleration stats of the vehicle. However, the \"best\" feature is the car\\'s roadability - like driving on a RR track. It is amazing how well this car hold the road. However, you must get winter snow tires or wheels as (with other sportscars) high speed performance tires don\\'t have the necessary grip. LOVE ALL AUDIS I\\'VE OWNWED AN AUDI 4000, 5OOO, AND A \\rA4 I PLAN ON BUYING AN A-8 NEXT YEAR. \\rIF AND WHEN AUDI MAKES AN SUV I\\'LL \\rPURCHASE THAT ALSO. Love my car baby! This was my mid-life crisis car, and it \\ris the most fun I have ever had driving. Awesome Ride This car is the best of all cars that I have owned. Is really fun to drive also very powerful and I will not sell it, I will enjoy every bit of it because it worth it. It got a beautiful design but the only down side that I have experienced is that the seats can\\'t be positioned the way you wanted to be comfortable while driving, but is not that bad is just not the best. I still going to say is the best car I have owned and I love it.  2005 Audi TT  This my first Audi vehicle  I decided to go with the TT . For in one simple word, economy. Fuel prices are outragous out here these days. And the large vehicle I had replaced it with was costing about $138.00 at each fill-up. Every single week. Also I wanted something in a 2 seater with a four cylinder, but with the turbo I still get the  punch needed to get past those tractor trailers on I-95. Since it\\'s my daily driver, I dont even mind those $48.00 fuel-ups. Yes, one unforseen expense, she goes thru high performance tires a lot, mostly in the right rear and the front right also. Overall its been a good expirience.  TT Envy It took three years to decide to buy and so far, so good. The TT is incredibly fun to drive. It\\'s speedy, but more of a cruiser than a bruiser. Style is the selling point.  Tony\\'s toy I have owned my 3.2 TT for 15 months and have driven over 20,000 miles with it. The  best thing is I\\'m stationed in Germanny with the US Army and as we all know there are no speed limits on the German autobahns! I purchased a european spec model because I wanted to insure the motor could take the sustained high speeds. I\\'m here to tell you that the TT is a great car to drive especially when you like to drive 130-150 MPH for miles and miles. I\\'ve had no problems with the car and love to get in and drive as fast as I want on the autobahns. The car handles like a dream at speeds over 130 MPH.  Audi TT  This car makes me smile every day at 4:30 when I get to drive it home. It is a wonderful car, zippy and gets 30 miles to a gallon and at 3.10 a gallon that is a huge plus. Have only taken it on one road trip where we zipped along at 75-80 and the ride was fairly smooth, but when you hit a bump or a pot hole you knew it.  There is plenty of room for all my stuff if I fold the rear seats down.  The sound system is awesome.  I shopped for this car for months trying to decide which sports coupe was right for me and I am sure I made the right decision. My third TT is my \"best buy.\" This certified 2004 250 3.2 TT with DSG is my best buy.  Price was right and warranty is for 5 more years and up to 100,000 miles.  The DSG is perfect for my commute which includes the I-80 \"parking lot\" in Berkeley.  Acceleration is brisk and fuel economy is good.  My first TT was a silver 2000 180 TTQC.  My second TT was a silver 2002 225 TTQC. It was a fine car,my bad left knee just got tired of shifting on my commute. This 3.2 TTQC with DSG is perfect for my present needs.  I love the interior and exterior design of the Audi TT.  Since I do not like the shield grille design change Audi is making on new models, I am pleased to own one of the original design models.  Certified makes sense. Fantastic ride I purchased the TT Quattro from a friend and fell in love with it.  The performance is fantastic, design, style and eye appeal is unequaled in my opinion.  I\\'ve owned many sport vehicles, but this one takes the prize!!   2005 Audi TT, Loving it! This car is pure pleasure. It handles wonderfully, has many fun features, and can handle Southern California freeways as well as mountain roads with comfort and ease. I have had it less than a month and we are having a hard time controlling ourselves to limit driving it! The Audi warranty is 4YR/50,000 miles bumper to bumper and I want to use it to its maximum advantage. It\\'s hard letting it sit in the garage cuz this car is made to be driven! UNBELIEVABLE My 2005 Auti TT is the greatest car that I\\'ve ever \\rowned. I also own a \\'66 Jaguar E-Type \\rand a \\'52 Jaguar XK120, so I know great \\rcars. The quattro all wheel drive is \\rjust unbelievable. Nothing can stay \\rwith it on a twisty road. The gas mileage \\ris great for a sportscar, I average 30 \\rmpg. I still never get tired of looking \\rat it, it has the best interior in the \\rbusiness. Having said this, I had a fuel pump go\\rout at 50,000 miles, which was inexcuseable. \\rOther than that, i\\'ve enjoyed the \\rownership experience. I plan on getting another \\rTT in four years, most likely the straight \\r6.  Love this car This car is just plain fun!  I smile every time I drive it, heck, even when I look at it.  My wife says it is more comfortable to ride in on a road trip that our Volvo.  My little 180hp engine has all the pep I\\'ll ever need and gives me 34MPG on the freeway.  The trunk storage space is amazing, great for trips. Also a neat city car to get into parking spaces. The back seat is just a great place to keep stuff you want handy, and once in a while you fold it down as you now have a mini-wagon.  Only problem was the airconditioner went out on a hot day, they fixed right away and has been fine.  I\\'m not really a car nut, but I\\'m nuts about this car. Most Exciting Car I have ever owned I still get excited every single time I \\rget into this car.  It is such a joy to \\rdrive and this thing can really fly if \\ryou spend about $500 on a performance \\rchip.  But anyway, it turns heads and \\ris just a blast to drive.  It is so \\runique. A perfect match with DSG and V6! Performance: Along with the \\rintroduction of V6 engine in TT, the \\rbiggest highlight has to be DSG or \\rDirect Shift Gearbox tranny. This \\rtranny has 2 clutches: 1st clutch for \\rgear 1-3-5 and 2nd clutch for gear 2-4-\\r6. The result is a shifting speed that \\ris quicker than any stick shift \\ravailable anywhere on the market.This \\rsequential gearbox also has very \\rsmooth and linear during gear \\rtransitions. \\r Great Sports Car This is a fantastic car. It has the looks, with the sound and performance to match. It drives like it looks, compact and powerful. Beautifully designed interior with lots of technology. The coupe offers a spacious interior with plenty of storage space. It’s the perfect sports car. Good but not great. We bought our turbo Quattro in early 2000 for its excellent all wheel drive and turbo performance. Excellent attributes for Colorado. Back then it\\'s performance, handling, traction, braking and overall quality were cutting edge. In 165,000 miles it was reliable and fuel mileage quite good. However expert views of its \"fashion statement\" persona then and now are fair. Sporty driving with the manual transmission was nearly impossible given the positioning of the brake and accelerator pedals and poor brake feel. In 2017 there are better choices if you want performance, quality and handling in a snowy high altitude world such as the turbo, all wheel drive BMWs we now own. total quatro fun I have owned my tt for 15 years now and have just had my first bad experience with it. the repair shop charged me 400 bucks to replace an o2 sensor and it still ran like crap...they wanted another 700 to fix the problem...well...first of all this has been the best car ive ever owned, I normally do all my own work and have made some major upgrades such as brembo brakes and rotors, heavy duty torsion bars, larger turbo/ exhaust/ racing ignition..from audi..larger tires and rims but these were made when they needed replacement, except the turbo which I still have. I have driven this car from main to calif to florida to washington. fully loaded with my wife as copilot and were extremely comfortable. Even with the extra hp..about 300..I still get 34 mpg highway and have had fun with a few dodge challengers with their hemis. I\\'m due for some shocks and a timing belt and hoping I find a reasonable shop to do that. my only [non-permissible content removed] is with audi, the dash acted up almost as soon as I bought it and they replaced it, then about a year later it happened again and I had to pay the second time. well it screwed up again but I have never gotten it fixed, the temp gauge never says its warm and the gas gauge light comes on at 1/2 tank saying its empty. in 2001 they changed the analog part of the dash and from then on their hasn\\'t been a problem. but audi never admitted their was a problem until 2010 and then you had to be the original owner of the vehicle to have it replaced, well I was exempt because I already had mine replaced..another scam. so I live with it and its really not that big a deal. the car has been used for everything from hauling construction material, groceries, cement, windows and doors, 2x4s. camping gear, moving. and my work car everyday. I love it and wish audi would make a motorcycle. YOUR WARNING HAS ARRIVED!!! Super angry!! Had this car for 6 months and my car has 40,000 miles on it!! This car isn\\'t a high mileage car. So where do I begin, lets start with the electrical, a bulb in the tail light went out and fried the whole lamp and some other electrical components- $1100. The radiator fans clutching system went out- $800. The cooling module went out- $900 (causing the turbo to malfunction). The suspension is going out- $????. At 40,000 miles I find this to be a little ridiculous!! In just 6 months! I think this is totally unacceptable!! Go look somewhere else!! I ignored the negative reviews because I thought this was what I wanted... Please don\\'t make the same mistake as me!! Save yourself!!! Love It, Can\\'t leave it.  The Audi TT MK1 was designed to remind us of the Auto Union cars. It was a pure form with Bauhaus influence being key to its creation. I didn\\'t originally agree with the design of the interior, but now I find it to be of such a quality that it puts most other automotive interiors to shame. The car is holding up well appearence wise. I maintain the car myself and find it\\'s upkeep to be easy. I don\\'t trust another mechanic working on my car. I\\'ve driven over eighty thousand milesa in my TT and it continues to run without any major events. Changed the timing belt at 66,000 miles. I\\'ve replaced the alternator once, the starter three times, the water pump once and other things. I still love it. Sports car station wagon This car continues to be fun to drive, even after eight years of ownership, the longest I have ever owned one vehicle. What I love most is that for me, it is the perfect compromise between sports car performance and practicality. I have driven it at Sears Point, the most fun I have ever had in two days. I would highly recommend attending track events with your Audi, it was a total blast. On the practical side, I love the outdoors and can stuff camping gear, and a foldable 14 foot kayak in the back (with the seats folded down) and still have sports car performance on the way. There isn\\'t another coupe with this versatility on the market. This is whats up Had this car for 10 months, bought it with 69,000 miles on it. Considering I bought it for 15,000 it was absolutely amazing. Very fun to drive, quite good in the curves except for the mild understeer, and considering the size of the engine (1.8l) very fast. This car also handles remarkably well in snow. Zipping past Wranglers and Tacomas in 10 inches of snow is always fun. Beautiful Car... But Lots of Problems II\\'ve owned my TT for 8+ years and 115,000 miles. It\\'s had it\\'s share of problems and is not cheap to fix: dead water pump, broken steering rack, two broken ABS sensors, broken wheel bearing, dead ECU, misfiring cylinder, two broken instrument clusters, blown Bose speaker, etc. I still feel its one of the best looking cars on the road and it STILL turns heards today eight years later but it\\'s dying at only 115,000 miles and I need to sell it and something at least a little bit reliable. There is nothing like this car out there anymore though. The new TTs just aren\\'t the same. TT -- a Great Car that has Issues I had always wanted a TT. It\\'s a beautiful, timeless, distinctive design. Have had many problems with this car so far. Replaced the clutch @ 44k and the water outlet (common problem), $2,500. Then we had window lift mechanism issues, ($1,000). The gas door switch broke ($125), headlight washer -- (the front bumper has to be removed $400). Problems with the back-up lights, etc. Have read other forums that the timing belt can break unexpectedly.  Buy a used one if you know how to work on cars. Edmunds repair estimates need to be adjusted upwards. However, the TT handles great and gets good MPG -- important in LA. Presents itself well anywhere. Easy to get in and out of.  Mean design, not so mean performance When I first took this car out, I was a little disappointed by its lack of pep.  Supposedly this car has the same engine that they put into the VW GTI that year, the same GTI that my friend has.  My friend\\'s GTI definitely had more go-power, especially in 3rd gear.  This car lacked that \"mean\" mentality even after dropping down from 4th to 3rd to get that extra rev boost. After coming off of a Honda Prelude, shifting seemed a bit sticky and lacked smooth transitions from 1st to 2nd especially. The car\\'s handling was phenomenal even on wet roads and felt glued to the ground the entire way.  I love this car because of its head-turning design, handling and ability to amuse! Worth it to buy but not for racing Very nice car, interior and exterior. RARE car so gets good attention. 180 hp is not that strong but you\\'re driving for style not for racing. Audi TT This is a hot car... it turns heads everywhere I go. Also, on the functional side it is very reliable, no problems at all with it. Best Bang for the Buck! I loved the design aspect of the TT.  I\\'ve been through a few frustrating repairs, but overall I have greatly enjoyed this car and will be purchasing a new TT when the next generation makes it to showrooms.  I would easily recommend the TT to anyone, with a side note of expensive repair bills, but it\\'s German... all German cars are expensive to repair. Fun little car I bought a 2000 Quattro (29,000 miles) in 05/2005. I drive this car HARD and so far no problems except for the instrument cluster, but this seems to be rather common. This is a fun little car which has a lot of room (I am 6\\'2, 300), and fits the wife and dog just fine! I would like this little coupe to have some extra horses and a 6th gear, but it handles on rails. You CANNOT beat this car in the snow. I love zooming past the tahoe/jeep/escalade drivers in 10 inches of snow, and seeing the look on their faces!  All in all a great car, as long as it holds up!!  Dream Car or Maintenance Nightmare? Driving my dream car is great but owning it is not.  Good thing I bought the extended warranty because I needed all I could squeeze out of it.  If my money is going to Europe, I want to go with it so I\\'m selling my TT.  I\\'ll miss driving it and parking in sports car row but not the too-frequent trips to the dealer and the bite on my finances.  And I\\'ll stop twitching when the gas warning tone goes off because I think something else has gone wrong.  This was my second German car and I\\'ll never buy another one.  Get AAA road service; you\\'ll need it.  Audi understands nothing about customer satisfaction or support.  Great All Year Round! I\\'ve owned 3 Audis in the past 5 years and the TT is by far the best.  It\\'s been practically fault-free.  Those who complain about the maintenance should know better; when you buy a German car, be prepared to pay a lot when something breaks!  This car is more VW than Audi, so parts are somewhat reasonably priced.  If not for the size, I\\'d definitely go for another TT! Just add snow... I traded in my BMW 740, so this was a huge change. This has been a great car overall.  The 180 hp is much too slow, so I had to add a chip and the MTM performance package.  Still too slow. I never appreciate my car more than when it snows, the TT Quattro is amazing in the snow and cold temperatures. You can\\'t buy a German car and complain of the cost for repairs, it comes with the territory and although it\\'s pricey you get what you pay for.  Really wish I had gotten the 225hp! Amazing Ride - When it\\'s not in the shop Wow...truley an impressive car!  World-class styling (inside and out), great performance, a real head turner!  I use this car for my every day vehicle and loathe the days when I can\\'t drive it!  It\\'s a shame that I\\'ll be getting rid of it soon, as I am unable to afford the monthly (sometimes bi-monthly) maintenance on it. Relatively simple repairs to unnecessary luxury features (i.e., headlight washers) should not cost $500!!  I have only had repair work on these little nuisances...never anything major.  The Certified Pre-Owned \"warranty\" offered by Audi is a load of garbage.  The TT really is an awesome (initially affordable) toy to have...as long as you have deep pockets for repair! The TT is peppy! Driver seat is comfortable, interior circle theme is interesting and catches everyone\\'s eye. This car has a reputation for being fast and upscale. Despite a 4 cylinder, this car quickly accelerates, the AWD feature must give it an extra jump.  Smooth ride at high speeds.  AWD does indeed help in the snow. The rumbling sound gives it a race car feel.  Small enough to fit in the tiniest of parking spaces.  Leather is first rate.  BOSE sound system is awsome. Large trunk when seats are folded down.  Red interior lights are cool. Downsides: 0 legroom in back, this car is made for 2 and  a couple of dogs.  Expensive oil changes. i\\'d buy one again The Audi TT 225hp quattro is a dream  Fun to drive This vehicle is just fun to drive.  It \\rfeels and is very fast and quick, and \\rthe quadro makes it feel like running \\ron rails.  We had a Corvette befor \\rthat , but this one is more fun. Fun car Fun car to drive and have people  best awd on the market and fun to drive had this car a year now and its been  German Reliability? Just traded my TT in...a sad day, \\rbecause it is one of the most \\rattractive production cars I\\'ve seen. \\rToo bad it spent so much time in the \\rshop as it was certainly fun to drive. \\rGood looks and performance though are \\ronly part of the equation. Nowadays, \\ryou expect a $30k to be designed and be \\rwell built. \\r Maybe it was just my model but \\rConsumers Report gives it the \"thumbs \\rdown\" for reliability as well. \\r It was also a happy day, as my payments \\rto the service department at Audi will \\rcease. \\r fantastic TT coupe Purchased this car used at 47,000 miles \\rand 2 years old. It has always started \\rand run flawlessly without any \\rmaintenance problems whatsoever. Now at \\r50,000 miles it still drives and looks \\rnew. Although only 180 horsepower, it \\rhas sufficient power, so I would\\'nt \\rbother chipping it - even though the \\rchip would produce 225 HP at a very low \\rprice ! The only problem, if you can \\rcall it that, is I had to put on snow \\rtires for NE snow. The standard tires \\rare 17\" high speed rated, so they are \\rno good for snow. I highly recommend \\rthis entertaining coupe to anyone. Fantastic Fun for all Seasons I never expected to own a sports car \\rbut I could not resist the test drive. \\rIt was so much fun!\\rThe 180hp engine gives plenty of power \\rto this small car, accelerating so fast \\rthat before you know it you have to \\rslow down to the speed limit.\\rThe 4WD grabs the road on every turn \\rand is really convenient an safe in the \\rsnow.\\rThe front seat is comfortable even for \\rme (6\\'2\"), which does not happen even \\rin some SUVs.\\rThe biggest surprise was the trunk, \\rmuch more space than I expected, \\rluggage for 2 people is easy to \\raccomodate.\\rAnd on top of all: It is BEAUTIFUL! \\rNecks turn to look at it all the time. nice, but needs fixin\\' i bought this car as a certified pre-\\rowned which included the extended \\rwarranty.  good thing.  the car has \\rrequired regular car and attention and \\rmany parts have been replaced similar \\rto the experience of other reviewers--\\rsuspension, problems with alignment, \\retc.  i have the same problem with the \\rwheels and i am not convinced the \\rwheels are ever balanced and aligned.\\r the car is fun to drive, performs well \\ron the road and is terrific for \\rpassing and moving up in the pack at \\rhigh speed.  shifting is tight and the \\rclutch seems a bit \"delicate\" so \\rshifting smoothly is not always easily. Audi TT problems (car is not a turbo) Within 5 months of purchasing this car \\rI was left stranded on vacation. I was \\rtold the clutch was bad and I was not \\rable to shift into any gear but 3rd. I \\rhad 2 clutches replaced and the \\rtransmission before it was finally \\rrepaired. In addition over the next 2 \\ryears the rear suspension was replaced, \\relectronics for speedometer and the \\rfront windshield due to a stress crack. \\rThe low profile tires are terrible. \\rReplaced a total of 8 tires before \\rhitting 25000 miles. The wheels \\rconstantly get scratched since they \\rprotrude out from the tire. The area \\rinside the gas cap gets plugged and \\rwhen it rains the water is retained.    \\r     Really Nice Automobile. We purchased our TT used and have had \\rno major problems. There is not a Audi \\rdealership in Charleston, sc, yet, so \\rwe have to take it to Columbia, for \\rservice, and any warranty work. I agree \\rwith the other reviews. I love it on \\rthe interstate at about 85-90 mph. It \\ralways gets a few looks where ever we \\rare.   audi tt Bauhaus on wheels. Great syling, nice \\rperformance, lots of attention. Fun to \\rdrive and look at. Audi TT - still the best As one of the earliest TT\\'s, had some\\rrecalls and small failures, like window\\rmotors and cd changer, but all repairs\\rhave resulted in no follow-up problems.\\rStill the best looking car on the road,\\rstill smells new inside, still a\\rpleasure all the way around. The Audi you\\'ll remember This might be the best car I\\'ve ever \\rowned.  A few minor issues - wheels \\rseem to need to be \\'aligned\\' a little \\rto often.   It handles very well, very \\rvery well.   No complaints about \\rhorsepower - although I know a few \\rpeople have.  Seats are very \\rcomfortable and the interior and \\rexterior are eye catchers everywhere \\ryou go. Lemon This Audi I bought was \"Assured\" and \\rCertified!  It was in the shop more \\rthan 15 times in one year!  I have 2 \\rfriends with other Audi\\'s and they \\rhave simular problems.  Audi \"Customer \\rCare\" wouldn\\'t do anything since the \\rAssured warranty went over 2 months \\rbefore I called.  They are so cute to \\rlook at, but a major pain in the  &#@ \\rto take care of. Great!.. .but some 1st model yr bugs The TT is incredibly fun to drive.  The \\rquattro provides great feel for the \\rroad at high passing speeds as well as \\rin cornering.  I expected to sacrifice \\rsome reliability in return for having a \\runique car the first few years, but \\rAudi has had their problems coming to \\rterms with how to satisfy their \\rcustomers.  Go to the audiTT forum \\rwebsite (use your search engine) and \\ryou\\'ll see for yourself.  I would \\rrecommend the 225jp version if power is \\ryour main desire, but the 180hp version \\rcan satisfy most. You won\\'t find \\ranother car that looks as good for the \\r$, so be willing to put up with a few \\rservice inconveniences.  I love my TT. Driving the 2000 Audi TT Really fun to drive.  No mechanical  It works for me. We LOVE this car. Bought it new 3/1/00 \\rand have loved it ever since. Have had \\ra few minor problems but nothing of \\rany major concern. People still look \\rat it like the piece of art it is. And \\rit crosses all lines, it\\'s loved by \\rkids, seniors, black, white, young, \\rold, whatever...everybody wants to \\rknow \"what IS that???\" And it is as \\rmuch fun to drive today as it was two \\rand a half years ago. It\\'s better than the editors rate I bought the front wheel drive, 180 hp \\rmodel.  I don\\'t drive it in snow so I \\ropted for the cheap way out.  It\\'s \\rdeceptive.  It seems really quick, but \\rif you read the automotive reviews, \\rthey show it around 7 sec to 60.  I \\rthink that\\'s because of the \"slow\" \\rshift from 1-2.  If you\\'re like me \\r(middle aged, want a sporty car) then \\rthis is a good choice.  The seats are a \\rtad tight for someone of my weight \\r(250) but at 6\\'2\" this fits me fine.\\r The base stereo stinks.  I hate Bose\\'s \\rbut if I get another I will opt for \\rthat or do a custom installation. I Love My TT!! I\\'m a 57 yr. old grandmother & always \\rdesired a small sporty car. First time \\rI saw a TT coupe on the road I fell in \\rlove with it. I sped up to get close \\renough to find out what it was. All I \\rcould think about was the cute curved \\rshape. When I found out it had a small \\rback seat that folded down to make \\rextra room in the trunk, that was it \\rfor me. I had to be able to get all \\rmy \"stuff\" in the trunk for trips-\\rluggage, golf clubs, etc. It was a yr \\rbefore I drove the TT, all the time \\rthinking to myself \"this isn\\'t going to \\rbe all I\\'ve dreamed of this past yr\", \\rbut sure enough it was and much more.  \\rIt\\'s so peppy on acceleration and hugs \\rthe curves(quattro). Audi TT Coupe This with out question is the most fun  Unbelievable Quality & Workmanship Purchased car new in Feb 2000 and have  Volkswagen on Steroids This car is for everyone who put a 356 Still the one I have been driving my TT ( at every \\ropportunity ) since May 99. I purchased \\rit off of the floor at an auto show. I \\rfiguered as good as it looked, if it \\rdidn\\'t drive well I would use it as a \\rsculpture. As it turned out, nothing to \\rworry about about, the ride is great, \\rthe music sounds great and the inside \\ris as nice to look at as the exterior. \\rIf it is reliable over time, it will be \\ra long while before I look for another \\rcar. Owner Flawless.. o9nly car I have not gotten tired of.. it\\'s like a new car after 3 years.. just as much fun to drive each time. Great ride, great look great everything. Best car I have ever owned. Power, stability and beautiful design. One thing is definitely bothersome sometimes is that indeed you have a great machine with the tech entertainment of a 1990\\'s VW - Bluetooth connectivity does not support music (which even the cheapest cars do nowadays). Nothing else to complain about. Squeaky brakes Loved the car, want another, yet skeptical because when pulling up at a red light, loud squeaky brakes when coming to a stop. The best Great car, I known own theee of them.  Nothing else I need to say. The best car I have ever owned Awesome Audi TT Quattro First time I have owned an Audi.  I purchased the TT Convertible for my wife.  I must say this car is amazing!!  For the money it is so much fun to drive and always gets lots of looks and comments - Nice Car!!  Bright Yellow with a black top and interior 😀👍🏻 Audi TT Convertible May 2016  Is Good! Nice upgrade from a new 2016 Mazda Miata but miss the manual gearbox. Dynamic and Sport mode are good but Auto and Comfort frustrating to drive. Engine is near silent although dynamic mode pipes a false exhaust sound through the radio speakers - blah! I just had a performance exhaust installed by Remus and you can hear the engine now but still not loud. MPG ranges from 13 to 17 mpg according to the dash readout. Maybe in comfort mode it would be better but that\\'s like driving a Corolla. Fit and finish very good, looks great and tons of new tech. Much cheaper than a boxster.  Excellent German engineering all round but lacking that excitement factor. Nothing else really compares at this price point. No Regrets!  Audi for life Overall a really great car. I have driven the car about 1200 miles now over the last month. The only complaint I have is in normal drive (not sport mode), the car shifts too quickly causing lower rpm and sluggish performance at the low rpm, the engine almost starts knocking. Once you punch the accelerator, it downshifts quickly and performance is great. In sport mode, the car drives perfectly, shifting smoothly with incredible acceleration. In dynamic drive, the car handles like a race car, hugging corners with no body roll. Paddle shifts are easy to use, just need to get used to them since I am use to a normal manual transmission. Don\\'t put anyone in the back seats, it is good for holding bags. Love our TT Really fun to drive, fast and great on winding roads.  Great sound from B&O stereo. Seats are comfortable. Having the navigation directly in front of driver is great.  Rear seat is a nice thought, if you can sit sideways. It would have been better to have more flat storage space. TT and Fun The backseat really isn\\'t practical My sixth TT and the best yet OK, so I am a TT fanatic.  I\\'ve owned or leased 2 first generation, 3 second generation and now my third generation TT.  This is the best yet in all respects:  design, performance, miles-per-gallon, technology and fun.  Even one of my relatives who is not a car person marveled at the car and was especially impressed with the safety features, including the blind spot warning feature.  It\\'s beautiful on the outside with just enough edge to keep it fresh but still maintains the overall sophistication and timeless design of the original.  It hugs the road like no other, and I find myself accelerating into curves.  The seats are exceptionally comfortable and adjustable.  I\\'m not a race care driver, but I\\'ve certainly had no trouble getting this car up to 70-80 MPH in no time at all.  I still love the automatic spoiler.  But it\\'s the technology that\\'s the true star.  The virtual cockpit is amazing.  While it took my maybe half a day to get used to it (definitely worth reading the owner\\'s manual), once I did, it became intuitive.  You barely have to take your eyes off the road (just a simple glance down) and never have to take your hands off the wheel to manage any and all functions.  While not necessary, I have opted for Audi Connect and find myself using it more than I thought I would.  I especially like that I can have the system read my texts and emails to me out loud.  I feel obligated to find something to criticize; the only thing I would request is to be able to adjust the lumbar support up and down more -- a wider range of vertical motion.  Other than that, the car is perfect in my eyes. Awesome Audi TT This car is a technological show case!  It is quick, responsive, comfortable and solid.  Mine is the base model and still awesome.  I will find out about the quattro all wheel drive this winter.  With its\\' weight distribution it should be great.  The body being aluminum is great for corrosion resistance and light weight strength.This car allows you to adjust drive settings to your liking.  It is better than I anticipated. Great Car To Own I drove my TT for 12.5 years and loved it. I will recommend this car to anyone loves sports car. A Joy Every Time I Get In It Bought it secondhand, w/ low miles. Blast to drive! At 40K, no problems, but I have a reputable independent mechanic do preventative maintenance & proactively replaced the timing belt, etc. Very sport-oriented: firm ride, short gear throws, purpose-over-comfort cockpit, all fine - I wanted a sports car - but even for this driving enthusiast more than five hours in it is a little much. Top up, poor rear visibility - backing out of a parking space, especially with so many SUVs around, you can\\'t see. Best to park backwards. Also, top-down requires a manually installed tonneau, which you have to keep with you, limiting trunk space. Research the forums - they\\'re why I decided on the manual trans. My Audi is 12 Years Old ! This car drives/looks brand new. I sure get respect when I drive anywhere. The people at Pete Moore Chevrolet in Pensacola have treated me very well. My interior has the baseball optic which looks impressive. Turns on a dime, fast take-off and stop. It can be a little noisy, (road noise) but who cares, especially when the Bose is cranked up.Good car to purchase. Auditt Head turning all the time. Just cool and practical with front-wheel drive. What a blast! This car is the most fun I have had in a long time.  I can feel myself smile each time I get into it and start the engine.  Everything just fits and feels great and the engine purrs like a lion.  I wish it had a 6 disc CD in- dash but my i-Pod and i-Trip work great with the radio and to complain about CD capacity in an otherwise perfect vehicle just seems petty.  The handling and performance are right on target for daily driving and road trip fun and the seats are about the most comfortable of any in this class of vehicle.  I strongly recommend this car.  better than my Pontiac GTP in every way I have always owned GM products, now I see the reason people are buying the foreign autos, I love the head and leg room, the fuel economy, the sheer performance of this little 4 cylinder, manual/automatic car. 130 MPH smooth as silk in my 180 HP weeney model, it is pure fun, my wife and me have had more fun with this car than any car, bike, truck or camper we own, Wouldn\\'t trade it for the WORLD. . .Well Maybe. . .The DSG is amazing and the \\rcar handles so well.  I just love the \\rway that it moves.  It makes me smile \\reverytime I get in the car, that can \\rbe very hard to do in Los Angeles!  It \\rreally is the greatist. My DSG Rocks There are very few cars that have the \\rcomplete package: styling, \\rperformance, and comfort. This car has \\rit all. The shape of this car is a \\rtimeless as the 911. No one comes \\rclose to the interior styling. There \\rare faster cars, but none of them are \\ras fun to drive. Believe me, I drove \\revery sports car between $35,000 and \\r$60,000 (except the Vette)before I \\rpurchased my DSG roadster. Worth it I had previously driven an Audi TTR \\r225 roadster. While I enjoyed it to \\rthe end I was constantly hounded by \\rthe turbo lag that seem to be \\runpredictable in tight situations. I \\ram not aggressive but there are times \\rwhen turbo lag can affect safety.\\r I now drive the 3.2 DSG roadster. \\rOther than the problem albeit fixable \\rone that I encountered with the \\roverfilled compressor, it was a worthy \\rchange. No turbo lag. Though heavier, \\rit still responds well. The tighter \\rsuspension also makes the drive more \\rfun. my TT looks like a million bucks but only  YEEEE HAWWWw So far it has been a complete joy to \\rdrive whether short trips to the store \\ror on long highway drives.  I find the \\rcar to be quite comfortabe to drive and \\reasy to handle.  The best part is, it \\ralways makes me smile when I sit in it. Pocket Rocket    Traded in my BMW330ci for this \\rlittle monster. Got tired of seeing \\rmyself come and go at every light and \\rthis TT is distinctive.\\r    More than enough zip-- Sufficient \\rroom for 2 and luggage, this is a head \\rturner. Quick, tight and FUN to drive,\\rI love it. Proof that you can improve on perfection I was a prior Porsche owner when I got \\rmy 2000 TT. When, in 2002, a 6 speed \\rALM became available, I simply had to \\rhave that red coupe.  The 6 speed \\rmanual made driving such a pleasure, \\reven in traffic. I so loved that car, I \\rknew I would keep it forever.  But then \\rthe 3.2 was introduced and a review by \\rTechTV impressed me.  I had to have \\rthat new transmission and it was time \\rfor a convertible. I have never \\rregretted the decision.  Great  Roadster.. Log in 500 miles on my TT so far and \\rthe car has exceeded my expectations.  \\rThe car acceration is extremely quick \\rfrom a dead stop.  Handling is very \\rresponsive on tight turns, you also \\rfeel in control.  Ergonomically the \\rinstrument panel is flawless and \\rextremely easy to operate. The cabin \\rspace is fairly spacious for a 2 \\rseater, much more spacious than the \\rZ4.  The TT is extremely fun to drive \\rand worth every penny!    Best I\\'ve owned in 40 yrs of Luxury cars No problems and great fun...drives like  What a car!! This is the most enjoyable car I ever\\rdriven. It is a car that respond quickly\\rto acceleration and the ransmission is \\rsmooth and sporty.  The car with the\\rsoft top on, appears ordinary, however\\ryou lower the top and the fun begin. \\rThe car I drive car has a Bose system\\rand capacity for six cd\\'s. which allow\\rme to enjoy music for a long time, and\\rthat is a good thing because the access\\rto the cd changer is cumbersome to say\\rthe least.  The instrumentation readings\\rtook a couple of weeks to handle it, now\\ris just perfect for me. This is a good\\rlooking car that I recommend, especially\\rto those people living in places with\\rplenty of sunny days.   AUDI TT ROADSTER LOVE THE CAR.  IT\\'S BEAUTIFUL AND  Audi TT Fun to drive.  Quality throughout in \\rfit and finish.  The only sports car to \\rhave in the snow.  A bit underpowered, \\rparticulary off the line. This is a keeper! Bought the car with 2,000 mi and in\\ralmost a year only one minor\\radjustment....great drive....electric\\rtop is perfect...plenty of power in the\\rlittle 4 banger with the turbo....and\\rhigh marks for Champion\\rMotors...excellent sales and service\\rpersonnel. Audi TT is the best sports car going I\\'ve only own my TT for 1 year, but \\rI\\'ve been wishing for one longer than \\rthat.  It\\'s the most refine, tight \\rsports car I\\'ve ever had (and I\\'ve had \\rothers).  I can\\'t imagine anyone having \\ra TT and not being in a good mood after \\rdriving it.   This is a performance car The articles I have read on the \\rinternet regarding the Audi TT must be \\rreferring to the four cylinder \\rversions.  The 3.2 DSG has exceptional \\rpower and handling.  The exhaust note \\ris particularly impressive and it is \\ramazing to drive.\\r The only problems I have with the car \\rare due to it\\'s size.  Their is very \\rlittle room in the cabin, the \\rcupholders are useless, no armrest and \\rthe trunk is ridiculously small.\\r With that said this car is not meant to \\rbe practical.  It is meant to be a fun \\rcar with performance and it lives up to \\rthat billing. Sams Review I like it a lot because yeah my dad got  Art in Motion The Audi TT is a work of automotive art.\\rEvery piece and detail is well thought \\rout and made of top material. In a \\rworld where most auto makers give the \\rlook of aluminum and leather. The Audi \\rTT is the real deal. Nothing fake or \\rcheap in this car, high-end all the \\rway. This car is for people thats been \\raround sportscars and have that \"Been \\rthere, Done that\" mentality with \\rPorsche\\'s, Vette\\'s,etc.. Audi WILL \\rimpress you. Quality is in the details \\rand the TT\\'s beauty is more than skin \\rdeep. If Looks Could Kill! We tested other roadsters and settled \\ron the TT because it felt \"tighter\" in \\rsteering and suspension. We choose the \\r1.8L automatic only to discover that \\rit has four modes: normal drive, sport \\rdrive, push shift, and steering wheel \\rpaddles (I\\'ve never seen the latter \\rmentioned in a review). The sport \\rdrive has higher shift points for a \\rsound and feel identical to a manual \\rtransmission. And looks? The visual \\rimpact of our neon yellow TT with \\rblack roof is stunning!  Heads turn \\rwhen cars pass on the Interstate. Audi TT roadster I just got this car not even a week ago  Love the Car Teh car is fun to drive and has been  Perfect Great car !! Great buy !! I love it !!  Sweet Little Car! The TT is very fun to drive.  Excellent \\rturning radius, handles great with \\rplenty of power on the take off.  It is \\ra little noisy on the open road, but \\rthe sound system is so wonderful who \\rwill notice.  Some very nice, classy \\rextras like the wipers on the \\rheadlights and the the power wind \\rscreen.  The power top is quick and \\reasy to operate.  The greatest thing is \\rthe reliablity.  The car has never been \\rin the shop except for maintance, what \\ra wonderful change! I LOVE IT!!!! One of the most comforable roadsters  2004 TT I\\'ve owned the car for almost 5 \\rmonths.  It has been a pleasure to \\rdrive.  I had a Saab 9-3 convertible, \\rwhich was a nice car, but it didn\\'t not \\rperform as well...had a lot of shake \\rfor a convertible.   My audi tt I love it, Its fun to drive, a very \\rstylish car. Its great to cruise around \\rin. Everything in the interior is \\rbeautiful. Its super fast too! 2004 Audi TT Roadster 3.2L  Great looking car! I get many  pony I love the style of my TT, it handles \\rexcelently around curves and the \\racceleration is perfect. eleven out of 10 an auto where form and function meld  Impressive Non conformist style. Geared for the \\rindividualist. Driving not \\rfor \"xtreme\"ist pleasure but raucous to \\rplain old fun is available.  The Best of Sports Cars No need to go into detail.......The  Audi quttaro roadster A sheer pleasure to drive every time I  TT from Mexico Extremely fun! unfortunatelly not the \\rbest suspension for Mexico\\'s driveways, \\rbut lovely on highways. I do agree with \\rVALuptuous about the blindspot. Z3\\'s \\rhas nothing to do with the TT not even \\rthe 3.0 lts. Girls love it... I love my Audi TT I love my car!  I have never had so \\rmuch fun driving to work--or anywhere \\relse for that matter.  I bought my car \\rand took off on a \"road trip\" to \\rChicago.   Top down--Bose speakers--and \\rall that Jazz.  It\\'s a FUN car to own \\rand drive! The Perfect Accessory Its only been a few days with this \\r2004, and I like the style, the \\rinterior just makes me feel happy. Love \\rthe little metal portholes that adjust \\rthe vents. The instruments could be \\rmore intuitive but you get used to the \\rlayout after use... took me a couple \\rtries to figure out how the wipers \\rworked... and where the light switch \\rwas... its zippy and cute and just too \\rfun to drive with the top down. So far \\rit\\'s the best... cruising down LSD \\rthese summer nights... we\\'ll see how \\rChicago winter goes (but kept the sedan \\rjust in case)...  As good as it gets. This car is art in motion. Quality and  Steady, underrated and a good GT car You can pick up 1st generation TT\\'s, convertible or coupe for under $5k today.  If Audi built it today, it would be $60k in material to build it. Own a contemporary classic for chump change. Just do timing belt and h2o pump every 70k and you will be good. Don\\'t expect a wicked fast sports car, but a go in the snow GT.Update 2018: 14 years in, and still a great car.  Recently did a 400 mile day and driving normally, got close to 36 mpg. First car I\\'ve owned that I can\\'t fix myself ...but I love it all the same.  Got my TT Quattro Coupe for a song - while working at a VW/Porsche/Audi dealership.  Best thing about the job was leaving with the Audi.  It\\'s been a stalwart car.  More a GT than a sports car, it\\'s a little slow off the line, but really shines at 50mph - +90mph.  I live in a mountain community, and I often times just snick the transmission into neutral and coast.  It\\'s a great little sleeper car; on the open road, I get mileage in the high 30\\'s.   And storage, with the seats down, two full kegs of beer fit.  I know this to be true. My bomber Be aware of the dual clutch automatic needs regular (frequent) servicing at a dealer, the hydraulic shifting controller must be in top shape to prevent a jerky ride in traffic.  On the interstate you won\\'t notice. Disapointed with Audi TT I bought this car 5 years ago in 2008 with only 28K miles and even though its fun to drive the repairs has been ridiculous. The factory warranty expires at 48K/4years. The car was 4yrs and 5 months when I bought it. At 32kthe instrument cluster needed replacement at a cost of 1,250. At 40K the water pump needed to be replaced 1,850. At 45k the transmission needed to be replaced 5,200. At 56k the alternator, belt and tensor were replaced 1,650. At 72k the alternator was replaced again for 595.Audi should\\'ve replaced the the instrument cluster and the transmission because both failed before 50k but they washed their hands. After this experience I\\'ll stay with BMW,never buy an Audi again. Pick of the litter of the MK1 TT\\'s  This is my third TT of the MK1 series and is the best of the three in my opinion. The VR6 is a better engine than the 1.8 turbo. I have no timing belt woes to worry about, for example, because the cams are chain-driven. TT Dolomite I bought this car as a CPO car in September 2007.  It had come off of a lease and was immaculate.  The styling is untouchable, the Audi rings are enviable.  Boy racers (WRX, Evo, etc) don\\'t even come close to the classiness of this car.  Now the fun!  With some computer reprogramming and bolt-on performance modifications, this car will behave according to its image.  Chip tuning, water injection, exhaust upgrade, and AWD controller upgrade make this car the car that the factory should have produced. Really Disapointed I must have just gotten the odd lemon based on the other reviews. After 75,000 miles in 3 years, I have spent over $10,000 in repairs and maintenance. This includes $5400 for a timing belt at just over 50,000 miles. The car is got a lot of pick up after the brief hesitation waiting for the turbo to kick in. It corners well and the stereo system is great, but that\\'s about it. I have no desire to own another Audi. I have spent more repairs on this car than on my last 3 Toyotas combined and this car was far less reliable than my last two Volvos.   Audi TT 3.2L DSG is a different TT My favorite car. Before this I owned the 1.8L Quattro TT coupe.  The normally aspirated 6 cylinder with DSG gear box is a lot more sports car - it is what the TT should have been from the start.  I never thought that I would like a sports car without a traditional stick, but Audi\\'s DSG is great. The paddle shifters are great. My first TT had reliability issues, especially with the electrical system.  Through 30 months, this one has been flawless needing only routine maintenance.  Get special order outside mirrors to eliminate the TT blindspot. Change the oil often to prevent sludge. Awesome Car that needs very little I have had my 3.2 TT DSG for about 6 months now.  It is an excellent vehicle both in design and function.  A thrill to drive everyday.  Great handling characteristics with the quattro system.  The DSG and the 3.2 coupled together works smoothly in conjunction with each other matching speed to the revs of the engine for no jerking motions as in a normal stick shift.  Nothing like feeling the car might be out of position in the corner and knowing you need to give it more gas and not braking to pull thru it. Test Drivw at your own risk! The best vehicle that I have ever been \\rin?  No.  The best vehicle that I have \\rever owned or driven?  Absolutely!!  \\rMore fun than I could have believed.  \\rAfter my wife and I test drove a tt \\r225 coupe we agreed that this was the \\rcar that we had to have.  It is \\reverything that I had hoped for.  \\rResponsive, fast, nimble, very \\rcomfortable and also very cool.  Our \\rtt turns heads and puts smiles on the \\rfaces of everyone who rides in it or \\rwho dares to drive it.  Do not test \\rdrive this car unless you are ready to \\rpurchase one.  From the crisp Bose \\rsound system to the heated seats this \\rcar is luxury and sport come together \\rwith just the right blend. All wheel \\rdrive, 100+ MPH & city streets at 27 \\rMPG! Great little Car! The Audi TT is truly a drivers car.  \\rYour get great \"bang\" for your \\rpurchasing dollar not only with the TT \\rbut wit any Audi product.  The TT is \\rresponsive to the touch of the gas \\rpedal in any gear and blasts you along \\rthe road in style, comfort and look.  \\rThis is a great performing car that is \\rsuper on sunny days and will keep you \\rsmiling no matter how difficult your \\rday at work was. Instant Classic! What\\'s not to like about this car?  \\rEven though it\\'s been around for 5 \\ryears, it still turns heads.  I bought \\rmine a week and a half ago and it \\rlooks better every day.  It\\'s fun to \\rdrive, very comfortable, and not to \\rjarring for a car that handles so \\rwell.  The fit and finish is excellent \\rand everything is well put together.  \\rBuild quality is second to none.  I \\rlook forward to years of exciting \\rcommutes to work and can\\'t wait to see \\rwhat it can do in the snow this winter. A fun car I bought this car because it reminded \\rme of the old Karmann Ghias.  It \\rdoesn\\'t drive like one though.  Its \\rzippy, powerful and a blast to drive. A even more fun car with DSG and V6 What more I can say?! Fun to drive. V6 \\rand DSG push the car to another level. \\rEspecially DSG, you have to try it to \\rbelieve it.  So quick and smooth.  And \\rthe tuned sound from the exhuasts, it \\rmakes you feel like you are inside a \\rF1.  4WD takes me anywhere I want to \\rgo even a trip to the nearest skiing \\rresort in the winter.  So versatile, I \\rcan put 2 golf bags at the back (both \\rrear seats have to be folded down) \\rwithout any problem.  Put a car seat \\rat the back(Yes, you can put a car \\rseat at the back. My 2 year old \\rdaughter loves to ride in my red TT), \\rit becomes my family sport wagon.  GreaTT Vehicle What\\'s not to like about this car. \\rEverything is simply well engineered \\rand designed. From the curves of the \\rbody to the comfort of the seats, from \\rthe quick acceleration to the superb \\rhandling, from the all wheel drive to \\rthe ergonomic steering wheel, from the \\rlow gas milage to the cool gas cap and \\rso on.  This car compares with non \\rother I have driven, and I test drove \\rseveral other sport coupesin its price \\rrange and above. I look forward to \\rdriving the car to its limits everyday \\rand I have not found them yet!  Would buy another I have owned an A4 and thought that was \\rterrific. Wow, to my surprise this is \\reven better. When my warranty is up I \\rwill get another right away. This car \\ris so much fun to drive!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAR! This car is great!  I haven\\'t had it  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAR! I\\'ve had my TT now for about 2 weeks  more speed  This is a car to show off in! It has a \\rstyle all its own,right down to the gas \\rcap with an interior that compliments \\rthe rest of the car.  My 2001 Silver Audi TT Coupe I love the car.  The only knock has \\rbeen aimed at the electrical system and \\ron board compter.  Too many false \\rreadings.  With the Audi assurance \\rpackage, however, all reapirs are \\rcovered and usually performed quickly.  \\rI bought my 2001 used.  There have been \\rfewer problems recently.  Audi must be \\rgetting their act otgether and learning \\rfrom past mistakes. SJT Audi TT A wonderful little car. Excellent \\rhandling, good acceleration and \\rbreaking. I love this car!! audi 3.2 coupe great car, fun to drive.  with the new \\rv6, power is plenty.  the dsg gearbox \\ris very smooth with instantaneous \\rshifts.  the ride is a bit choppy. Understated Style This is a car for those who is tired  All I want is a headrush... The TT is a fun, sporty and very \\rstylish city car, which is what I \\rbought it for.  It is easy to \\rmanipulate through traffic and speedy \\renough to get you through tough spots \\ron the freeways.  If you are single, \\rthis is the perfect little car.  Tons \\rof fun to drive and to look at; people \\ralways love it. cool well just cool i had it for a year so  Review at 12,500 Miles Very stylish car that is fun to crank  AUDI TT ITS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE awd My audi is outstanding. I drove through  Lisa\\'s Go-Cart This is my second TT.  I totaled my \\r2001 about a year ago.  This has to be \\rone of the safest cars on the road.  My \\rcar flipped a few times & I didn\\'t have \\rany injuries.  Thankfully I was wearing \\rmy seatbelt.  I just bought a 2004 and \\rI couldn\\'t be happier.  I know as long \\ras I don\\'t get hit by a train, I am \\rsafe. Great Car As long as a 2-person vehicle is roomy \\renough for you, you can\\'t do any better \\rthan the TT.  The car handles as well \\ras you could hope for in this price \\rrange, and it looks superb.  It is the \\rmost fun car I have had in a long time. I\\'m going to throw this car... WOW - I should have nver bought this\\r$36,000 headache.  At 5 months old, this\\rcar cries with more aches than a $2000\\rGeo -I took this heap of junk into\\rservice 4 times already to fix my\\rpiercing brake noise problem (probably\\rwith more visits to come), had the\\rwindow motor replaced after its second\\rrepair visit and to top it off, my TT\\rdecides it wants to stall out on me when\\rI start it up.  When I met with the\\rRegional Rep., he questioned, \"Well,\\rwould you want to have unreliable brakes\\rhave reliable brakes that squeal?\" Did\\rthose words actually come out of his\\rmouth? - So, do all safe brakes squeal?\\r Ugh\\x85I should\\'ve talked to a wall instead Great Four Season Sports Coupe Great fun car.  Able to go anywhere any \\rseason.  Quattro is great in the snow \\r(with Blizzaks). Comfortable for 6+ \\rfooter, unlike most sporty cars. Good \\rluggage space for size. I easily fit \\rtwo sets of golf clubs. Excellent power \\rand handling. Although others may excel \\rat the track, as an everyday driver, \\rthis car is superb. the best i have purchased this audi as a used \\rvehicle with 3000 miles on it. it is an \\r02 and i find it to be fun to drive and \\rvery stylish.  i am 6\\'3, 250 lbs. and \\rthis was one of few sports cars that i \\rcould fit into.  the other sports car \\rwas a corvette.  its handling and \\rperformance is far superior than a \\rnormal driving car. The good life in a beautiful car I\\'ve been shopping for an Audi model \\rfor a year now initially my first \\rchoice was the Allroad, then an A$ \\rAvant, then an A4 cabriolet, then an \\rS6 Avant. I\\'m now the proud owner of \\rthe TT 3.2 Quattro, and I\\'m absolutely \\rloving it. It handles like a dream, \\rit\\'s fast, and it looks extremely \\rsexy. What more can I say. It\\'s been a \\rlong journey, but well worth it. The Law Of Driving Although I have had the new and \\rimproved 250hp TT only a few months and \\rthe weather has not been so cooperative \\rhere in NY, I am thrilled about the \\rpower, the ride and excitement of this \\rTT. It took a little getting used to \\rthe sporty ride but well worth it. The \\rupgrades make this car, including the \\rV6 and exterior lines. As indicated \\rabove the law of driving must include \\rfun and excitement, tempered with \\rthrills and some real guts. My new TT \\rdelivers. MAY I HAVE ANOTHER PLEASE.. I am coming up on the end of my TT \\rlease in a few months and I have \\renjoyed this car so much I think I am \\rgoing to get another.  There is not \\ranother car on the market that is \\rsuited to my driving needs and \\rpreferences.  I live in a snowy \\rclimate, and once I put on snow tires \\rthis car was more sure footed than my \\rJeep. The cornering is phenominal, and \\rthe styling is the best in it\\'s class.  \\rAs far as repairs I have only had this \\rcar in the shop once to replace a power \\rwindow regulator, not too bad for \\rinitial quality.  I would and do \\rrecommend this car to anyone who wants \\ra fun drive, with a reasonable cost of \\rownership. tt quatro 6 spd The vehicle has lived up to my \\rexpectations.  It performs and handles \\rgreat, is reliable and comfortable. Its \\rsporty, yet practical, 4 seats and a \\rgood size trunk/hatch. Way2Fun Way2Fun is the personalized plate I \\rhope to have on my brand new TT 3.2 \\rQuattro!  It is Imola Yellow and \\rgorgeous inside and out.  Distinctive, \\rcomfortable, and appeals to my \\rpractical side: year-round driving, a \\rhatchback, a small, but useful backseat \\rfor little things.  The sound system is \\rgreat as well.  I drove it in the snow \\rand cold yesterday for the first time \\rand, wow, great performance! (With snow \\rtires on.) I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT!!!!!! Fun Car Fun car to drive, fast and holds the \\rroad well under all conditions.The \\rengine is very smooth with no power lag \\rwhen shifting gears. Wonderful daily driver\\'s car I put in about 120-150 miles per day on my TT \\r- most of them on windy backroads. I\\'ve driven \\rand owned many RWD dedicated sports cars \\rand unless you are on the track at or near the \\rlimits, the TT provides a superior experience. \\rThe Quattro system makes this a great car in \\rrain or snow (if you put on some Michelin Pilot \\rSport A/Ss). Don\\'t pass it up. BREAK SYSTEM SQUEALS!! I purchased my TT back in September -\\rback then, when the temperature was\\rmild, I had no problem with my breaks. \\rNow that winter has arrived, anytime the\\rtemperature is below 40 degreees\\rFahrenheit, my breaks produce a HIGH\\rpitch squeal, as if someone is running\\rtheir fingers down a chalkboard!!! The\\rdealership told me that \"sometimes\\rthings like this happens to cars.\" \\rWHAT?? A car worth $35,000 should not\\rsound like its in pain. Not even a\\r$15,000 Corolla squeals when it\\'s cold\\routside.  If this problem has occurred\\rwith anyone else, PLEASE let me know -\\rIf I would have known about this in the\\rfirst place, I would have NEVER wasted\\rmy money on this car. The most fun car I\\'ve ever owned We own 3 convertibles and this is by \\rfar the most fun. The body style is \\runique, looks like a more traditional \\rroadster. What a blast! The ride is very firm but not \\rpunishing, even driving 800 miles in a \\rday.  Steering is immediate and has \\rexcellent road feel. The suspension \\rimprovements give the car excellent \\rhandling.  Altitude does not seem to \\rhave an effect on the pulling power of \\rthe V-6.  This car draws a LOT of \\rattention from other motorists, so be \\rprepared to answer questions when you \\rstop.  The dsg handles up and \\rdownshifts with no fuss.  A nice \\rfeature is being able to downshift by \\rpulling the paddles by the steering \\rwheel to use engine braking, even when \\rthe transmission is in D or S.  Fuel \\reconomy is very good for a high \\rperformance car, averaging 26 mpg so \\rfar. it good but... Pickup is good but a sports car witout  Lemon Law the TT I am lemon lawing this vehicle!  \\rNothing works correctly, my TT has \\rbeen out of service for 23 days and I \\rhave only had it for 10 months. It was \\ra brand new car when I bought it.  If \\ryou buy this car, be prepared for lots \\rof time at the shop and plan on \\rdriving a loaner.   TT 225 Yhis car is exelent great performance  Problems with Audi TT Not a 2004 TT, but a 2000.  Problems \\rencountered out of warranty:  AC \\rCompressor - $1,500.  Cooling Fan - \\r$300.  Belt Tensioner - $280.  \\rInsulation fell into AC Blower - $275.  \\rBroken Wire to Turbo - $115.  CD \\rChanger Stopped Working - $350.  Oyxgen \\rSensors - $700.  Electrical problems \\rcome & go.  Car is serviced regularly, \\rnever abused and looks like new, but \\rhesitate to go more than 25 miles from \\rhome. Outstanding German car Best car I have ever had love it cant wait i can not wait untill the 3.2 audi tt  TT Aesthetically, the TT is still one of \\rthe most pleasing cars around, inside \\rand out. The TT drives like a go-kart; \\rturn the wheel and the car goes with \\rrigidity and assurance. There are cars \\rwith more power available (and more \\rpower and less weight would be a good \\rthing for the TT), but quarter-mile \\rtimes and top speed are not what TT \\rdrivers should be looking for. The TT \\rcomes into its own on windy country \\rroads, where it is simply a blast to \\rdrive. Art In Motion WOW. With the new 250 HP engine, the TT \\rdelivers even more zoom than before. If \\ryou\\'re looking to buy any other coupe \\ryou owe it to yourself to drive this \\rcar first. One thing is for certain \\rabout this car, unless you buy a $100K \\r+ exotic you will never get more stares \\rand compliments on your car than with a \\rTT. This is one fun Car!! Let me just start off by saying that \\rthis is one fun car to drive.  I have \\rread a lot of articles talking about \\rhow it\\'s not as fast as some other cars \\rout there.  Let me tell you I have \\rdriven the 350Z and the boxter.  Once \\ryou get past the launch.  this car is \\revery bit as fast. It is just harder to \\rget the car going from a standing \\rstart. And what a lot of these articles \\rforget is the allwheel drive, it is \\ramazing.  It handles like a dream, very \\rpresise.  Definatly a sporty ride. Very \\rlittle body roll.  I have never owned a \\rcar that makes me want to go into the \\rgarage in the middle of the night and \\rjust look at it.  This car does!   Like they say,  The design, both interior and exterior, \\rof this car is 22nd century.  It \\rhandles pretty good as well.  Not the \\rfastest machine on the road, but fast \\renough to feel that the car \"goes\" when \\rone wants it to go.   great greatest car i\\'ve ever driven. Blindspot Good job, Hans and Frans! \\rThose Germans know how to make good beer\\rand cars - this car hugs curves, just\\rlike how my playmate hugs my rump.   I love my roadster I just bought mine used w/98,000 miles on it.  Other than hitting a bear (yes, a bear) not more than 14 miles from home the day I purchased it, I have thoroughly loved my car.  It\\'s the perfect \"Divorce Revenge\"!  My car handles beautifully.  I trust it!  Everything except the inside trunk release works.  That\\'s going to be fixed soon.  I love the top down or up!  It\\'s so fancy, stylish & with the great gas mileage, I\\'m enjoying my 2 hour ride into work.  I\\'ve always wanted a convertible & am not disappointed w/my choice.  It\\'s solid, very quiet & drop dead gorgeous.  Love the turbo!   My warranty is amazing too!  The trunk space is very adequate.  The seats are ultra comfy.  I\\'m enjoying my 2 hour ride into work now! 2003 Audi TT convertible We just red picked up this car yesterday from a small dealer in the San Francisco area. It\\'s beautiful, clean inside & out. There was a minor glitch resetting the radio security code but we got that fixed.  We do have a squeak coming from the front left but are going to deal with it until we can get it checked out. The automatic convertible top works great which is s bonus for our California to Philly road trip. All in all were happy. Hot car Purchased as 2nd owner from dealer. 35K on the clock in 7 years. Since it is almost new, I expect NO problems and haven\\'t been disappointed [yet]. Powerful, fun to drive, great handling, eye-catching and real economy - 30 mpg, suburb stereo. This car has all the bells and whistles I\\'ll ever need.  Plan on keeping this car a long time only driven in summers. Will do maintenance as recommended by factory - my best attempt at forestalling potential problems. New to me Purchased a one-owner roadster in almost showroom condition and I\\'m sure NOT sorry about that move [further down the road, I may change my mind]. Plan on continuing with the factory maintenance schedule to prevent any problems.  This car is very fun to drive and very temping to get into the turbo boost - gotta be careful because it is easy to speed before you know it.  Has all the creature comforts my Sebring convertible lacked. Feels very solid, tight and a high level of build quality is evident. It\\'s a tough act to follow Although the first few months of ownership were filled with computer related and dealer repair problems (almost 1 month to get is all working). It is tough to find a replacement vehicle, at this price, that offers the style and design features of the TT Roadster. The Baseball Optic leather seats with dark blue and blue canvas roof and brushed metal hardware are striking and hold up to wear well. They speak to the high standards of Audi\\'s designers and engineers. The power train and exhaust have been reliable. There is more than enough hp/torque for an everyday vehicle and the all-wheel drive has served when needed. \"Keyless\" entry occasionally needs reprogramming it eats batteries. Good Beats Bad I bought mine used with 63xxx and in impeccable shape. With or without the top down, you get noticed in this car, a lot. The car handles extremely well, especially at higher speeds. The engine purrs, but does not have a strong kick at the starting gate. The ride is harsh and noisy. Lots of metal rattles underneath and in the rear, none of which the dealer can figure out!  Heating/cooling and stereo are outstanding. Bottom line:  the good far outweighs the negative. Audi TT Car has ben in shop 3 times since purchase for minor maintenance.  More of a nuisance than anything else. Even Used Its Great ! I purchased a certified, brilliant red roadster 180 FWD automatic just for fun. What a great little vehicle. Love to cruise around as I don\\'t see many other TT\\'s in South Dakota ! People ask about it all the time ... red color really helps.  Fun in the Sun Fun factor is high. plenty of z4\\'s out  2003 Audi TT roadster I selected this vehicle because of it\\'s \\runique design and available performance \\rupgrade options. In my opinion, audi is \\rone of the most innovative automakers \\rand I respect their innovation in \\rproducing vehicles such as the TT and \\rthe Lemans concept. Eye Candy This hot little sportster is a eye\\rcatching whiz.  Everybody looks,\\reverybody wants to know how much it is!\\r I have only one problem--the tilt wheel\\rdoes not move the wheel far enough down\\ror up as other car models do.  Other\\rthan that the car is packed with fun\\raccessories and a nice little learning\\rcurve on how to use them! Pers[ective audi My audi TT is quite reliable.needibg no  TT after 3 months I purchased this car as a 25th wedding \\ranniversary present for my wife.  She \\rtypically doesn\\'t get excited about \\rcars, but really went crazy over the \\rTT.  \\rI\\'ve had various convertibles for over \\r17 years. I drove a Z4 and and a \\rBoxster (tiptronic) for comparison.  \\rTT won out on styling, interior \\rquality and what I would label as 80% \\rdriving - that stuff we all do during \\rour daily trips around town.  Z4 was a \\rclose competitor, but I just couldn\\'t \\rget used to the looks.  Boxster (with \\rtiptronic) was a dog to drive around \\rtown, and it\\'s interior was pretty \\rspartan (read cheap looking) compared \\rto the other two.  killer Favorite car of all time My Toy Roadster Power plant is acceptable for this kind \\rof vehicle. Performance is great... \\racceleration is superb, although scary. \\rDMV threat me with revoking my license \\ris I get another fine. It cruises at 80 \\rmph with no effort. Style and design \\rprovokes in others curiosity and \\radmiration. It\\'s a simple fun to drive \\rand owned german roadster. I will not \\rhave it any other way! Nice! This car is very thoughtfully \\rdesigned.  I was comparing it with the \\rBoxster, which I thought had an edge on \\rthe exterior styling but the TT\\'s \\rinterior styling is nicer.  Plus, I get \\ra lot more car for less money -- rear \\rglass window, retractable rear wind \\rdeflector.  And I love the silver cover \\ron the audio system.  It\\'s such a nice \\rtouch.  The construction is very \\rsolid.  You can tell when you close the \\rdoors and trunk.  It\\'s very solid. autobahn excellent car, drives great, looks \\rgood...must stay off intersate \\rroads...to many pot holes... Wonderful Thi has been a wonderful car.  As a 6\"3 \\rguy, for a long distance car, not the \\rgreatet, but to have around town it is \\rawsome.  Love the way it handle, fun to \\rdrive. A very reliable car Fun to drive This car is very fun to drive. Also is  TT Lover Loved the styling at first sight, but\\rwhat really sold us was the comfortable,\\rroomy interior when we took it out for a\\rtest drive!  WOW!  It\\'s just what we\\rwanted in a convertible, quick, easy,\\rlots of FUN.  Not a copycat design; has\\rall the features you could want for\\rcomfort and convinence.  The maintenance\\rplan was a big plus too.  The seats hold\\ryou in while you\\'re doing those\\rimpossible sharp turns...those tires\\rreally hold on tight and no body roll to\\rspeak of.  Driving it everyday to and\\rfron work with the sun and wind in my\\rhair is a great attitude adjuster...LIFE\\rIS GOOD! BamBams TT love affair excellent , used to drive a Boxter and\\rnow would only get an Audi Awsome Those who say the TT isnt a \\rperformer..it depends on the driver.  \\rMotor Trend even said its almost up to \\rBoxster S on back roads.  If u want \\rsomething fast in a straight line get a \\rCamero SS.  I\\'ve raced Boxsters and \\rsmoked them on back roads.  Also you \\rcan do so much with the 1.8 litre \\rengine, eventually getting it well past \\r300 hp.  You dont need anything \\rfaster..trust me. TTs a blast to drive I bought this car in Idaho Falls &  Looks ain\\'t everything Unreliable, poor gas milage, unsecure\\rsteering, cramped cockpit, lousy ride\\rafter a few hours...but WOW!!!  It LOOKS\\rGREAT!! NEW TO PERFORMANCE CARS THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A\\rPERFORMANCE CAR, THE CLOSEST I HAVE\\rBEEN INVOLVED WITH PRIOR WAS THE\\rMITSUBISHI 3000GT. THIS AUTO IS A REAL\\rKICK TO DRIVE AN HAVE THE TURBO KICK IN\\rTO ACCELERATE WHEN NEEDED, THE AWD MADE\\rIT GREAT ON TIGHT TURNS LIKE ENTERING OR\\rLEAVING A THRUWAY AQT HIUGHWAY SPEEDS.\\rTHE BASEBALL GLOVE LEATHER INTERIOR\\rCAUGHT EVERYONE\\'S ATTENTION WHEN RIDING\\rWITH THE TOP DOWN. I LOVE MY TT I LOVE MY TT. IT HANDLES GREAT, IT \\rLOOKS AWESOME WITH THE TOP UP OR DOWN. This is my second TT! I just traded my 2000 TT Coupe in for a new \\rTT Roadster. I love this car so much!!! \\rBeautifully built and designed. Not the fastest \\rcar in its class, but who cares? It\\'s swift \\renough and the turbo is fun. Test drove the \\rrest of the competition before making my \\rchoice on another TT. I\\'m in love with this \\rcar!!! TT for Tina I totally love my Audi TT, I am a car \\rnut and I used to race when I was \\ryounger, this car drives like a dream \\rand I am so happy with it as you can \\rtell that I recommend it to all who are \\rwilling to smile from the moment they \\rget in until pulling into your \\rdriveway.You will also notice people \\rstareing at you and the TT but do not \\rlet that bother you. ENJOY THE RIDE Awesome Performance Lots of Fun This car is pure fun!  The acceleration \\ris excellent-especially fun to feel it \\ropen up from second to third! Great \\rhandling in turns, smooth ride, low \\rnoise, great engineering.  With the top \\rdown it is also impressive - unlike \\rsome convertibles this car is \\rengineered with passenger comfort in \\rmind with the top down.  The balance of \\rair flow is perfect to keep passengers \\rcomfortable in higher heat or in cooler \\rweather.  Good sound system - but \\rprobably the only thing I would \\rupgrade.  Seats are extremely \\rcomfortable and the visibility is very \\rgood for a convertible.  The interior \\rtrim is awesome.  Very sleek, fun \\rvehicle.  I have enjoyed every moment!   my baby this car is my baby, im 18 and this was \\rmy first car and i love it to death... \\ri know im a spoiled little daddies girl \\rbut i grew up around cars and i know a \\rgreat car when i drive it, im the envy \\rof all my friends, everyone wishes they \\rhad an audi, but im the only one who \\rhas one and that makes it that much \\rbetter. I love the special touches i \\rmade to it, i got it painted light pink \\rand got light pink stitching to the \\rinterior, its my baby Great Car Bad Dealership I love the car but don\\'t by from Rusnak \\rPasadena.  The customere service is \\rhorrible.  Okay back to the car.  Great \\rto drive and really fun.  A little \\rsmall at first, but you get used to it.\\rOverall very satisfied with the car. Convertible Fanatic I have owned a new Miata (fun but too \\rsmall if you are 6feet or taller), new \\rChrysler Sebring convertible(nice \\runderpowered family convertible), a \\rJag XJS cabriolet (pretty but junk)and \\ra BMW 328i convertible (Great \\rPerformance Car, but high maintenance)\\r The TT is a great design, great ride \\rand lots of fun.  The Audi service \\rplan built into the price lowers your \\rannual operating costs as well and \\rthat made it very attractive.  Also, \\rto go with the great styling and mid-\\rrange performance, there are great \\rdeals on this car right now! I Love my TT I have had no problems, and have loved \\revery mile I have driven the car.  I \\rhad trouble believing that I did not \\rneed to take the car back to the dealer \\rfor 10,000 miles or one year and \\rchanged the oil after 2,500 miles and \\rabout 6 months.  It is not awesome in \\rspeed, I had a 911 before and this car \\rdoes not have the same torque, but it \\ris quick and it is fun.  jon it is a great car  with lots of speed  Very classy comfortable! PROS:  Fun to drive and look at.  The \\rtrunk is much larger than it appears \\rfrom the outside.  The detail in the \\rdesign of the interior is very \"James \\rBond\".  CONS: Steering wheel jerks to \\rleft with acceleration.  Windshield is \\rin your line of sight unless you are a \\rsmall person.   Overall, this car is \\rmade for its exquisite appeal and not \\rnecessarily for a luxurious drive. Buyer Beware This is a warning to all those \\rconsidering this car.  It is a horrible \\rcar with an extremely poor build- \\rquality.  The car looks great, both on \\rthe inside and outside.  It is \\rcomfortable and is a fairly nice ride.  \\rHowever, the reliability and \\rworkmanship are so poor that I would \\rnever recommend it to anyone of my \\rfriends.  My car was in the shop at \\rleast 16 times in 18 months.  If you \\rare considering this car, I would \\rhighly recommend that you look at other \\roptions.  This is a very, very poorly \\rbuilt car.  This is not just my \\ropinion.  I have several friends who \\ralso own this car and fully agree. Best car purchase I\\'ve ever made! I first saw the Audi TT concept car in \\ran auto magazine in 1995 and thought it \\rwas just another concept car that was \\rexactly what I wanted, but would never \\rmake it to market.  Happily, I was \\rwrong!  \\r It\\x92s now a year after I purchased my \\r225 HP Quattro TT Roadster, and I still \\rget the same thrill driving it I did \\rthe day I took it home.  Let me add by \\rsaying that driving the TT at dusk with \\rthe top down is about as close to \\rautomotive heaven as I have ever come. \\rAnd, you\\x92ll definitely turn several \\rheads with this car.  The styling has \\rturned more then a few heads and the \\rbaseball glove interior is also a \\rconversation piece at social get-\\rtogethers.\\r 20,000 Mile Review Have had my TT for nearly 2 years. The \\rcar has been outstanding..  Styling, \\rquality, performance and still turns \\rheads.  Only mechanical problem was a \\rdefective turbo replaced at 3,000 miles. Pocket Rocket This was my dream car when it came  Style is everything The best designed car I have ever seen. Classic Roadster Certainly the most fun I have ever had Quality and Performance One of the best vehicles I\\'ve owned.. hot tt This car is spectacular. Audi TT This car is about as fun as it gets. It \\rmay not be as fast off the blocks as \\rthe Porsche but it\\'s got the retro \\rstyling that distinguishes it from the \\rrest. There are distinct styling \\rfeatures imprinted throughout the car. \\rHandling is impeccable with very slight \\rundersteer. No skimping in the details. \\rIt would be nice to put an Audi \\rperformance chip in it, but that would \\rvoid the warranty. Awesome Care Great little car.  Very sexy. Modern Classic Stunning compact roadster is a modern \\rclassic. This car grows on you the \\rlonger you own it with interior styling \\rthat makes sitting inside the car as \\rpleasing as looking at the sleek \\rchassis design. Get black exterior \\rwith \"baseball\" optic leather and you \\rhave a vehicle that never stops turning \\rheads. Life is good in my little TT The TT Roadster is one of the most fun \\rand good looking cars out on the market \\rtoday.  Unfortunately, it is a bit slow \\rout of first. With the one exception, \\rit is the best little car I have owned. Fun to Drive, Expensive to Repair Great little car that is unfortunately over-engineered and very difficult to repair.  Even minor repairs may require partial disassembly.  Labor charges are high, and since the parts usually must be ordered from Germany, their cost are also high.  Expect to spend as much or more on repairs as you spend on the purchase price (for a used TT). Problems Had it for 6 years and had nothing but problems- had to replace the battery 3 times. Had problems with both windows (replaced motors), Glove box broken (kept it shut not able to use $700 to replace) , had to replace the dashboard controls as the gas guage was giving false readings. Also, had to replace fron front rotors at 40K miles.Keyless entry had to be replaced as I think it ate up the battery.Replace various hoses etc at 60K miles. Classic As an Audi Collector I believe this one will be an Audi Classic in due time. I\\'ve owned this one for 6 yrs and the only probs have been the electronics (windows, etc.). It is still as tight as the day bought and the 1.8 engine is a miniature work-horse. It\\'s a solid machine that will be kept for ages. Believer I am 2 years into my used TT. It is picture perfect and fun to drive. 33 MPG on the HW 29 in town and I have a heavy foot. Best snow car I have ever owned (lived in CO for 29 years). Would get an extended protection plan as repairs are pricey. I love my car and always get asked about it. Fun Got it used and had it for a year.  It turned out to be what it was advertised to be - fun and great to drive.  Very good acceleration, handling, fantastic in the snow with snow tires. Long-term review 2003 180HP TT Coupe Driving before the turbo kicks in is painful. The paint is EXTREMELY susceptible to scraches, dents, and road damage. The Tiptronic chip had to be replaced along with the battery at 8000 miles. The instrument cluster had a problem at 28000 miles. The glove compartment handle broke during normal operation at 5000 miles. It tookthe dealer two CD changers (CDC) and several complaints to get the CDC working right. The brakes would \"scarily push back at your foot when depressed harshly\"; the dealer never found anything wrong. Just like the exterior, all the nice brushed aluminum accents are extremely susceptible to damage/scratches. Love the car, never again Have the TT for over three years.  Love the way it rides. Fun, handles great, though alittle heavy. Inside a little claustrophobic with many blind spots. Most disappointing is reliability.  The car has 6400 miles. So far the electrical system, air cond. system, dash cluster fuel gauge, glove box have been repaired. Need I say more? Would think twice about the 2003 TT. Experience with my Audi TT \\'03  I purchased my TT on 06/03.  A month later, I added a 6-CD changer for $350.  It took over a month for the changer to arrive at the dealer, and it was incorrectly installed (lid kept popping).  The tiptronic tranmission chip had to be replaced at about 10000 miles, the handle of the glove compartment broke when pulled with average strength, the battery died at 12000 miles and had to be replaced, an indicator cover (on the side front of the car) was loose and had to be replaced, the lamps on the trunk, etc... Overpriced Two plus years into owning a TT is disappointing.  I have had model cars that held paint better.  Chips and pits galore.  The keyless remotes constantly require reprogramming, and the Audi comprehensive warranty is not all it is that good.  The dealer will decide when you get what fixed, regardless of your feedback.  Brakes wear, well we understand they are soft but they are within .000001 inch, so no replacement.  Come back after the 50,000 mile waranty and we will be happy to replace them for a fee.  My first and last Audi, just to much money for an underperforming vehicle. Never in the garage!  The grocery getter has been retired! From a \\rVolvo XC to an Audi TT, I\\'ll never look back. My \\rTT never sees the garage as I\\'m too busy \\renjoying the drives around the winding \\rcountry and city roads of Northern California!  Love my 225QC!!!! I just bought the last 2003 TTC225Q \\rfrom the dealership nearby.  This is \\rthe car I\\'ve lusted after for 4 years \\rnow, and I\\'m definately not \\rdissappointed.  I love the way it \\rmoves when I floor it, and the turbo \\rlag isn\\'t THAT bad.  This is my first \\rturbo car (previously had 2 GTI \\rVR6\\'s), and it\\'s a blast to drive.  \\rThe build quality is exceptional.  I \\rcan\\'t wait to drive this for years to \\rcome. Ooo-La-La I love my TT. Plain and simple. I\\'ve \\rridden in and driven corvettes, \\rporsches, bmw M3s M5s, lancer evo, wrk \\rsti, etc. Mostly while shopping for my \\rgirl recently. None just felt as right \\ras my TT. After each drive I hop back \\rin the audi and suddenly I\\'m reminded \\rof why I work 50 hours a week to drive \\rthis car. Oh and for the love of god \\rplease don\\'t buy a roadster. Please.  Much Fun, but with an annoying squeek. I bought my \\'03 TT new. At about 2,000 \\rmiles it developed an annoying squeek \\remanating from somewhere in the right \\rrear hatch area. I took it to the \\rdealer who did some \"insulation\" work \\rwhich helped for a short time, but then \\rit came back. A week ago I \\rhauled 4 bags of seed topper from \\rHome Depot and the squeek went away for \\rthe most part. I\\'m wondering if the \\rproblem could be related to the right \\rrear strut mounting. Could a bushing be \\rthe culprit? Otherwise, the TT is a \\rblast! The Quattro is fantastic in the \\rwet; when everyone else is lifting, the \\rTT tracks along like it\\'s on rails. I \\rgive it a 9 overall. Audi TT A great car, and a blast to drive -- \\rnot much to complain about.  Got the \\r225HP, and wouldn\\'t mind just a little \\rmore power.  But amazing performance \\rfor a 1.8 litre 4 .. and awesome fuel \\rmileage for a true sports car.  We get \\rabout 31MPG.  It\\'s my wife\\'s car, and \\ris perfect for her.  I\\'m 5\\'11\" and it\\'s \\rjust barely big enough to be \\rcomfortable for me.  If you\\'re over 6\\', \\rthis probably isn\\'t the car for you. I love this car!! I just picked up my car yesterday, I \\rLOVE it.  I\\'m going to be 50 next year \\rand I decided to trade in my 2002 \\rLexus ES 300 on something fun.  Life \\ris just too short!  I\\'m very picky \\rwhen it comes to quality.  I don\\'t see \\ranything about the TT I don\\'t like.  I \\rdecided on the automatic, simply \\rbecause the traffic is so bad around \\rhere, I didn\\'t want to do a lot of \\rshifting.  Audi even makes it fun to \\rdrive an automatic!   Dream Maker The Audi TT (220 hp)is the car of my \\rdreams. I believe the 180 is a waste of \\rtime.(Nice copy of the 220...but not \\reven close to the REAL thing) They \\rspared no expense in making it all \\rluxury as well as being the ULTIMATE \\rsports car. Audi know\\'s how to pamper \\rdrivers by making the experience the \\rmost pleasure you can get with your \\rclothes on!!! I love my car and will \\rcontinue a relationship with \\rAudi/Porche for my next purchase. \\rThat\\'s IF I EVER give up my TT!!\\rThank you\\rCheryl Bellows\\rNashua, NH TT4ME Although I\\'ve only owned the TT for a \\rlittle over a month, I am thoroughly \\rpleased with every aspect of the car. \\rThe TT has plenty of power, excellent \\rbuild quality, and, for a sports car, a \\rcomfortable ride.  The four year old \\rdesign still looks fresh and modern.  \\rIt is a blast to drive! crouch rocket the most enjoyable vehicles i have  nice ride no problems with my 2003 TT 225 coup. \\rTest drove- boxster, lost it in a curve \\rat 70 tt held on, Z350 - nice power \\rnice exterior, plastic iterior not \\rfunctional for golf clubs- lexus 430- \\rheavy, hated the shifter and the 911- \\rexcellent a little too pricy and again \\rgolf club issue. Live in NE and no \\rproblem with al the snow wehad great \\rcar lots of looks and comments LOVE THE TT This is the BEST sports car out there.   Difficult to ask for more.... The Audi TT Coupe is a very interesting \\rcar in many ways.  It is a head-turning \\rattention getter that has one of the \\rmost amazing interiors of any car I\\'ve \\rever seen, much less owned.  The power, \\rwhile criticized by some reviewers, is \\rmore than adequate unless you plan on \\rracing regularly (not me).  You get a \\rgreat deal of car for the price, with \\rvery few problems.  As for comfort, you \\rget a nice ride that, again, is \\radequate for most anyone.    The \\rcontrols are excellently placed.  \\rFunctionality is almost perfect, except \\rfor the flaws below. Great Fun Great sytle, great handling, better \\rthan average power, more cargo space \\rthan a sports car, good sound system,   \\rI can drive it every day of the year, \\rand it\\'s a head turner.  What\\'s not to \\rlike?  Well, the blind spots caused by \\rthe body style, but you get use to them. All looks While the ext/int design is incredible, \\rthe mat\\'ls & fit and finish make a \\rgreat 1st impression, it can\\'t hide the \\rVW Golf roots.  The handling is all \\rundersteer.  The all on/all off \\rthrottle make the tubo lag feel worse & \\rthe engine shakes at idle.\\r The 6 speed autotrans is excellent & \\rmasks the turbo lag some.  Shifts are \\rcrisp, smooth & timely, making the most \\rof the engine.\\r Rear 3/4 blind spots are huge.  The \\rview out feels like an igloo with low \\rset windows.  My head hits the roof \\rgetting in and out.  \\r This is rolling sculpture. It\\'s not a \\rsports car.  As long as priorities fit, \\rthis is a great car.  The wife loves it.\\r more than expected traveling 1400 miles seemed like \\rnothing.  the ride, enjoyment and ease \\rof driving made the \"road trip\" melt to \\ra simple around the block cruse.  \\raveraging 80+ mph and 35 mpg is not \\ryour average sport car trip, not to \\rmention the comfort and ease of driving.\\r Z who?  I had one.  This car has style, \\rand is an original.  Like the original \\rZ it sets the trend and others  follow.\\r sure other sport cars have more power, \\rbut none have more syle, comfort and \\roriginality. Read all the magizines \\rcomparisons you want.  I will take my \\rTT anyday over the competion.  I\\'ll be \\rdriving while they pump gas.    tt review great fun to drive ... coasts at 100 mph. superb acceleration from 70 -  90 mph TT Times 2 My second TT (the first a 180HP coupe) \\rhas taken the fun up another notch.  \\rThe 225 hp 1.8 liter coupled with the \\r6-speed is a huge improvement in \\rcapability.  Both of my TT\\'s were \\rQuattro-equipped and I wouldn\\'t have \\rit any other way - the stability of \\rthe car on the road is never in \\rquestion.  The ESP makes cutting loose \\ron gravel much more enjoyable since it \\rkeeps the nose pointed where you steer \\rit.  I recommend a switch to all-\\rseason tires from the factory \\rperformance treads if you live near \\rsnow.  Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t change a \\rthing!\\r I\\'ve never enjoyed driving \\rmore...that\\'s even including my \\ryounger days driving Triumph ragtops. TIME FOR AUDI Since I bought my TT back in February \\r2002 I have had nothing but pure fun. \\rEvery time We are in the car we get \\rlots of attention. People here in \\rHawaii still point whenever we pass by. \\rAlthough I think it should have more \\rhorsepower, everything else about this \\rcar is just great. I feel like I\\'ve \\rbeen driving this car all my life. The Mother of all Sports Coupes This car has been out since 2000, and \\rit still turns heads.  It has a great \\rengine sound.  The car is very fast. It \\rmight not beat a 350z or GS Coupe 6MT, \\rbut its styling and build quality blow \\raway any similarly priced sport coupe.  \\rThe seats are firm.  The gears are \\rshort and easy to find.  The turbo lag \\ris negligible.  The quattro handling is \\rlike nothing you\\'ve ever experienced.  \\rOne would have to be very reckless and \\rmake many mistakes to get into trouble \\rwith this car.  The car is solidly \\rbuilt and can be driven every day. hot looks, with a real soul watch out for the first and second gear \\rshifts, it needs to be tightened up.  \\ralso make sure the seats are adjusted \\rproperly to your liking before you \\rdrive. seat adjustments are manual.  \\ronce you kick into third gear, it is \\rquick as lightning and the handling is \\rgreat.  also watch your head when \\rentering.  otherwise, it is an awesome, \\reye catching performance sports coupe. My second TT When the lease ended on my 180hp 2000 \\rTT, I wanted a change, so I \\rheaded to the dealerships to find a \\rreplacement.\\rThe Infiniti G35 felt more like a \\rCadillac than a sports car, and \\rundersteered at 25MPH on a corner that \\rI take daily in the TT at 35. The \\rPorshe Boxter was faster, the \\rBMW330 and Mercedes CLK a smoother \\rride, but somehow none gave me the \\rsmile that the TT has for 3 years. \\rI\\'m now the proud owner of a 2003 \\r225Hp TTQ. Turbo lag is more \\rpronounced than it was on the 180Hp, \\rbut the extra 45 horses are a welcome \\raddition. It still turns heads, and \\rthe interior fits like a glove; it \\rcouldn\\'t feel more natural or \\rcomfortable to drive. TT Quattro is a great car I own a 2002 TT.  I live in Germany and \\rhave to traverse a windy mountain road \\rto get to work.  The ride is made \\renjoyable by the car.  It\\'s also a \\rgreat car on the autobahn.  I can \\rappreciate the reviews about not \\rholding the line in a curve as well as \\rPorche and BMW, however I can drive my \\rcar in the winter while they are in the \\rgarage.  There is always a trade off. Love my TT! I have so much fun driving my TT. The \\rone drawback is all the attention you \\rget in it, people are sometimes a \\rlittle aggressive to want to see it, \\rsit in it, etc. perfect car i think this is the most beautiful car  One Awesome Car This car is hot!  I bought it because I \\rwanted a sports car I could drive year \\rround in Colorado, and of course \\rcouldn\\'t bring myself to buy another \\rfront wheel drive vehicle.  The AWD \\rhandling is making me rethink my \\rpreference for the rear wheel drive, \\ractually.  The Quattro system is a \\rdream drive and nothing I\\'ve ever \\rdriven handles small, winding, Colorado \\rmountain roads like this car.  While it \\rmay not have the top acceleration of \\rthe Porche, the power it has for a 4 \\rcylinder at this price level is \\rincredible, really.  A true bargain! Audi TT is the best its so cute and fast, its the best car \\rever made. My Little Rocket I\\'m 53 and wanted something fun to  uhhh... this is a good car, but i wouldnt \\rsuggest it to everyone, get a different \\rcar for the same price, and you might \\rget a better deal. AwesomeTT! Well, I must say that the first thing \\rthat I noticed about the 2003 TT\\'s was \\rthat the 6 spoke rims that come \\rstandard on the quattro model is so \\rnice and elegant compared to last \\ryear\\'s model.  Also worth noting is \\rjust the AWD feature that the 225 has!  \\rYou can take 25mph turns going 50mph \\rand still feel like you are in complete \\rcontrol of the car.  I didn\\'t really \\rbuy the whole \"useless\" backseats quote \\runtil I actually got in to it.  But \\rlet\\'s face it, you are not buying the \\rTT as a family car. TT is a great car Absolutely a great car even given it  This is the best This is the best car I have ever driven, it is sooooo awesome! Awesome find. I got a great price for a 2002 Audi TT. Everything seemed to work great until i ran out of gas on what seemed to be a full tank. Fuel sender must be broken. Other than that, its a really fun car. 8 years & counting Fun to drive, love the 180 for around town drives because of the early & flat torque curve. It\\'s as quick as the 225 for normal use for this reason (full torque @ 1950 rpm) & this is the last year for the true manual shift- which is a preferred feature for us- wanting a true old school style sports car. Burns Premium only. The trunk is roomy, AC is great. Had some minor issues- dip stick crumbled, cheap cd storage latch broke twice. We plan to keep this baby many years & are aware of timing belt issues that bear watching. It\\'s a great sports car in the old tradition, but without the leaks & rattles of the old Brits. Run, don\\'t walk, away from this car I purchased this car on 12/16/2009. In February 2010 I had to replace the front brakes for $600, timing belt and water pump for $1,000. Now in March, The temp gauge sensor is not working ($115), fuel gauge sensor is not working ($650), the center display on dash is starting to go out ($1,800), throw out bearing is starting to go out ($2,000), brake lights keep getting stuck on, and last but not least it eats oil.  What a car! This is not the first sports car that I have owned but, it could be the best.  The turbo charged 4 cylinder is a great engine and really pushes the car around.  The convertible adds that extra touch that makes the car a real pleasure to drive.  I love the handling of the car through the turns of a winding road. Best used car I have ever purchased Purchased used in Jan 07 in NY (I live FL), certified and only 19800 miles on car. No problems at all, runs great and I replaced the ugly rims with something that finishes the car much better than stock wheels. Averaged 28 miles to the gallon on trip back from NY... this car will be a classic one day. Great fun drive Gets looks everywhere. In love with the turbo.Tremendous fun to drive. No comparison with the others. Very reliable and trouble free. Already 12 service visits? I purchased this car new in Oct \\'02.  Of\\rcourse the interior and exterior design\\rare unparalleled, the quality of the\\rworkmanship is something to be desired.\\r Since new, I have been to the service\\rdept. 12 times, all for petty things,\\rsuch as blown speakers, stuck glovebox,\\rnew climate control unit, new instrument\\rcluster, and many others.  I love\\rdriving this car, but I expect better\\rquality from such an elite marque. \\rGuess I\\'ll be buying a Lexus next time\\raround. granoley\\'s TT This has been a great, and fun car and \\rwould recomend it highly. The smiles \\rand looks you get are also quite nice.  Better than Porsche After shopping the Z3 and the Boxter, \\rI chose the TT. 65,000 miles later I \\rknow I made the right choice. Much \\rmore confortable,with lots of features \\rthe others do not have, gorgeous \\rinterior, all wheather usability, and \\ralmost the same performance. Gets \\rlooks everywhere. Tremendous fun to \\rdrive. No comparison with the \\rothers.Very reliable and trouble free \\rafter 65,000 miles! A truly great car. Audi\\'s Suck My vehicle has been in for service 48 \\rdays and is not yet 2 years old \\rintermitently does not start-dealership \\rcannot find problem. Sway bars replaced \\r3 times, stereo replaced- insturment \\rcluster failed,CD player had to be \\rreplaced- build quality is crap- DO NOT \\rBUY-Mercedes,BMW,Infinity first-many \\relectrical problems-I am having to sue \\rAudi-Audi corp policy- THEY DO NOT \\rREPURCHASE THERE VEHICLES- YOU DO HAVE \\rTO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO SUE THEM- not \\rsmart for a car company that wants to \\rretain it customers- and really bad \\rpolicy!!! So Cal Audi rep should be \\rfired!!! Audi TT - CA Lemon Law Works! Replaced turbo, sway bars, dash \\rcomputer twice, drivers seat and horn - \\r14 WEEKS+ in service.  Burns 1 quart \\roil every 900 miles. Rear suspension \\rcreaks over uneven surfaces such as \\rspeed bumps, driveway entrances.  I \\rrequested the Audi service manager and \\rAudi Factory 800# to set-up a meeting \\rwith the local Audi Factory Rep \\x96 it \\rnever materialized.  After 20 months of \\rrun-around, I hired an attorney and WON \\rmy case using the CA Lemon Law.  Audi \\ragreed to repurchase the car including \\rtax, license.  Bottom line:  The Audi \\rFactory rep that handles Torrance, CA \\rarea - should be terminated \\x96 his/her \\rnon-response is the only reason I hired \\rthe attorney. Love the stares Have nothing but fun with this car.  classic Most reviews about sports cars in the \\rstates are written by americans for \\ramerican cars, american muscle cars are \\rnot the same as european sports cars.  \\rDon\\'t compare european cars with \\ramerican cars, they don\\'t mean the same \\rthing, its not always about 0 to 60, \\rbut how you feel when you arrive or how \\ryou feel when driving.  This car has \\rlines and character that should make it \\ra desirable collector car later in \\rlife.  Today it\\'s a great car and fun \\rto drive.  It looks good, drives well \\rand certainly is a great car to drive. Fun under the sun all positive in first sixteen months \\rand 11,700 miles. Dealer (Steve \\rWhite in Greenville, S.C.) is top \\rnotch.\\rImpossible to pay for anything but gas \\rand tires once the car is yours and \\rthat sure makes driving easy on the \\rwallet.\\rmy wife likes it as much or more than \\rthe Boxster she had and the quattro \\rawd system is terrific. Best in it\\'s class I just took an early retirement and \\rbought this as my toy, with my wife\\'s \\rapproval. This car is the most fun to \\rdrive since I had a 67 shelby GT 500. \\rEvery time I take it out I receive \\rcomments from total strangers. NO \\rregrets at all. choose wisely initially, we thought we would never \\rsel this car. Boy were we wrong.\\r Handling and performance are great, \\rbut what a dissapointment in terms \\rof maintenance and aggrivation.\\r small plastic pieces (knobs, buttons, \\rlevers, etc. ) are CONSTANTLY \\rpopping-off or breaking. \\rReplacement parts take FOREVER \\rto come to the dealer. - BEWARE!!. TT Roadster This car has been a joy! If you want to \\rwatch some heads turn, drive the TT. I \\rthink the TT has the best looking \\rinterior(baseball stitch) I\\'ve seen. \\rIt\\'s a very unique and solid built \\rautomobile. Love this car!! Great car with lots of room even though  Float like a butterfly... Although the trunk might be small, \\rand the drink-holders hard to reach, \\rthis car is pure fun to drive. The \\rsound of the 225\\'s dual exhaust \\relicits chills, and the car\\'s yummy \\rlines summon one more look over \\rthe shoulder of even the most \\rcalloused driver. The other woman... Wanna find out if your significant \\rother is the jealous type, then you \\rhave found the car to fall in love \\rwith!  A pleasure to drive and a dream \\rto own - turns heads everywhere, people \\rcan\\'t help but talk to you about it.  \\rMinor parts quality issues aren\\'t a \\rconcern with exemplary dealer \\rservice/care.  Interior is divine. Better value than SLK About a year and a half ago I wanted to \\rbuy a convertible.  I went down to \\rcheck out the 3-series convertible, and \\rthe salesman wouldn\\'t even take me \\rseriously because I was 26.  Looked at \\ran SLK, and similarly equipped was \\raround $47000.  Got mine for just under \\r40k, and I tell ya, it gets more looks \\rthen either of those cars.  More looks \\rthan a Boxter even.  Sure, the Boxter \\ris a better street performer.. But \\reverybody has a Z3 and a Boxter.  It \\rhas more headroom than the SLK too.  \\rIt\\'s everything a stylish roadster \\rsould be.  I love it.  Audi has found a \\rlife-time customer. Great sports car Driving a six-speed, turbocharged, \\rfive-valve per cylinder, all-wheel-\\rdrive, convertible sports car with \\rbrushed aluminum accents and fine \\rleather on the interior and stylish \\rexterior is about as good as it gets. pretty good car Well when I saw it I knew that I had to Looks good, not so great Audi took an exceptionally styled \\rvehicle and went nowhere with it.  The \\rpaint quality does not maintain a shine \\rand scratches very easily.  Power \\rleaves much to be desired at lower \\rrpm.  Interior design is well done, \\ralthough a little more storage space \\rwould be helpful.  It has a VERY rough \\rride on imperfect pavement. Great FUN great car with great looks! i really \\renjoy to drive her, not just on sunny \\rdays (even during wintertime in \\rswitzerland)! after 6 months still \\rcan\\'t get my eyes off her! best buy so \\rfar! it looks awseome all that matters is it is the hottest  Just in time for summer!! This car is perfect.  Looks like no \\rother car on the road.  Driving it is \\rpure fun.  I look forward to long \\rtrips.  Handles great, and feels solid \\ron turns and at high speeds.  Even the \\rgas mileage is great for a sports car \\r(25 mpg!).  The interior is a perfect \\rbalance of sportiness and comfort.  \\rI\\'ve leased this car, but I\\'m probably \\rgoing to buy it at lease end. fun fun  to drive i have so much fun driving it for the \\rlast 2 years,(i think i was the first \\rone in th e metro ny )and yes i can \\rtell you many stories................... Practicle fun Great ride. Excellent value. Excelent Good Car Buy it Living in Europe Excellent vehicle, have used it in the racetrack and has proven to be a purebread roadster. Excellent roadhandling but a a bit harder suspension is requiered over 120 MPH, Pretty good top too at that speed !!\\r Hey that´s the advantage of living in Europe !!! 100 MPH + all the time!! After 2 Miatas I\\'m finally having as much fun on I95 as on the back roads of Cape Cod.  In NYC, I have to nurse the accelerator to avoid rocketing up the turbo power curve (not to mention living in dread at what the pot holes might do to the low profile tires).  Otherwise, it\\'s fun, fun, fun. Perfection After test driving many compact roadsters such as the BMW Z3, Porsche Boxter S, and the Audi TT, I decided the Audi was by far the most competant all around car in this class you can buy.  It is a GREAT CAR!!\\r tt roadster -- quatro great turbo delivery. at 2500 rpm, what fun. An old guy with a fun car! It took me over 3 years to find this car.  I flew to different parts of the country, including Florida to Arizona, to satisfy my wants.  I know when you purchase an older used car there will be needs and always expect them.  Needless to say an Audi dealership inspected the car and helped me understand future needs.  Tires, brakes and rotors, timing belt, water pump have been major improvements as of this date.  All expected!  Just love this car and my preferred mode of travel for short distances.  It is a third car in a two driver family and my other cars are a Mercedes and BMW.  These used for long distance driving.  I\\'m 6\\' tall and weigh 200 lbs.  More than adequate room and comfort.  My age makes it a bit difficult getting out.  Again, a most enjoyable ride. Look at everyone stare as you go by Car is one of a kind without a doubt, great engine (had water pump replaced with metal impellar version for reliability, ecu raflashed, new dv, and p-flo intake. It is now where it needs to be for being a sports car with more turbo kick and less restriction on the engine. Great to drive anywhere anytime, handles unbelievably well on all roads. Only minor problems have occurred but nothing that cant be fixed by joining a forum online and a little bit of mechanical common sense. I highly recommend purchasing used, with the 225 engine with a 6 speed, its all fun when you want it and feels great driving through town watching everyone\\'s jaw drop at the styling and sound. Want a sports car? Go buy a greyhound. TT coupe is without a doubt the best car I have owned. Beware, this is not a sports car. The engine lacks power and needs a re-map for true performance, and the handling in corners while better than most typical US cars and SUVs is terrible in standard trim with excessive understeer and roll. Having said that it is fast enough to eat most other traffic for breakfast and great fun on rural roads - especially if there are no proper corners. Fuel economy is pretty special considering the performance and the design is iconic and fast becoming a classic. If you can live with the unreliability and couldn\\'t care less customer service from Audi, you should buy one. 20 year Z guy gone Audi The exterior lines of the 1st generation Audi TT are destined to be classic. With a factory spoiler it evokes thoughts more of a classic Porsche than a Golf or Beetle. Not only did the car redefine Audi, making cars like the R8 possible, but it also redefined a segment of which the 350z took many notes.  As far as things falling apart, we will see.  From experience, when a typical American is faced with a knob, switch or lever we are not familiar with, what do we do...we wrench, wiggle, push and pull on it until we brake it. God forbid we get out the manual!  Handling is fantastic. Braking is better than anything I have ever driven. 370z included.  Backseats, perfect, for my 2yr old. Don\\'t buy a TT I bought my dream car used 2 years ago. Since then it has had one problem after another. The timing belt breaks prematurely with these cars and Audi USA knows this and does nothing about it. Instrument cluster fails, fuel cell broken 3x, automatic window motor goes out. If you get a flat tire you have to buy a whole set of new tires because they have to have the same tread wear as it is AWD. And even the most minor thing to fix is very expensive I had a blast driving it when it wasnt broken, but it seems to be breaking more and more and the car is only 6 yrs old. Don\\'t buy this car no matter how \"pretty\" it is.  Buy Used Save Money Have Fun Car still had full warranty for 10 months. Just know what you\\'re buying. You cannot go wrong with an Audi. Parts are expensive, but check salvage yards   The car shifts smooth, corners great. Invest in good tyres always, do not have to be the most pricey ones. It rides a little stiff but it is supposed to.  German Precision American Vision The car lacks power but has EYE appeal galore. I added a Borla catback system, a D-BOV both of which make great sound, power and Looks. P-flo air. Euro tail lights, short shifter, custom mats, red LEDs inside and paint wax custom front full bra. I have a ride I can be proud of set of tires are General 225/45/17 never thought I would own GENERALS but made by Uniroyal great tyres. TT holds the corners and going up hill it keeps giving you more power. My wife drove it and could not believe the power it has she said it never quit  when she demanded more it was there for her. My Little Red Coupe This car has provided me with the most fun of any car I\\'ve ever owned.  Handles great in the snow and ice, and amazingly on mountain passes.  Good thing skis became shorter in the past years, as there\\'s not a lot of room inside, and Audi stopped making their racks for the TT.   Audi service has been fantastic to deal with - I\\'ve had very few issues over the four years I\\'ve had the car.   I think I\\'ll end up keeping this one until the wheels fall off.   Can\\'t think of another car at the price range that packs the punch that the 225 hp TT has in terms of performance and craftsmanship.  A blast to own! This car caught my attention when it first came out.  It was always a dream of mine to own one and now I do!  I cannot go anywhere with out getting a compliment on the car.  People always love the red interior and want to ask questions about the vehicle in general.  If get the opportunity to own one of these beauties be prepared for a lot of attention, especially outside of affluent areas. However, there is a down side.  There have been a number of problems with the drive train on the car and Audi of America has been less than helpful at some of the turns.  Be prepared to go through some hassles.  But if you can take it in stride it will pay you back! Get the extended warranty I have had many small problems. Some of which I\\'ve had fixed by Audi service only to have the problem come back. Never left me stranded or embarrassed.  I get lots of looks, kind of a funny sounding wimpy idle. Handles like it\\'s on rails but could use a little more power. Tons of space for a small car. It\\'s my work truck, I have seriously fit a 32\"X80\" door into it just fine. Half dozen 2X4\\'s no problem. Can get 7 5-gallon buckets and my tools. my dream car... It is all you need on a car!! Fast and reliable! Since I was a kid I was dreaming about the car!!  The only problem: cops! they really chase you all around!!  Audi\\'s warranty is also awesome!! They really take care of you and your car!!   Lemon or not? I have dreamed of owning an Audi TT for years.  I found an \\'02 with 14K miles on it, garage kept (impeccable condition). Still smells new. I thought I was getting a real good deal for paying $23,900. I thought there can\\'t be anything wrong with this baby. Well, I bought it on a friday evening, took it home had it for the weekend and noticed a knocking noise coming from the front driver\\'s side tire. Called dealership where was purchased, said you have to call audi, had it picked up monday, shipped to San Antonio TX, they kept if for 2 weeks, received it friday. Drove it 2 miles and same loud knocking. It\\'s getting picked up mon again and god only knows how long it will be before i get to enjoy. My little TT This was a fun car to own, however my biggest disappointment was that in 3 years the dealer could not make it stop rattling. Also, the cargo cover in the trunk is really a piece of junk - a primary source of rattles. Other than that it was quick, reliable and fun to drive. My second TT I had an early 2000 TT with the 180hp engine, and loved it, but yearned for a bit more engine.  Two years later and a really good lease deal and my yearning is satisfied.  My green 225hp is a perfect blend of great performance, fabulous looks and even excellent fuel economy! My only mistake was the lease which means I\\'ll have to find a replacement - possibly my third TT if Audi doesn\\'t mess with it too much in the coming model year. Style over substance This was my first German car after one Toyota, one Honda, and two Acuras.  This was such a wonderful change from the Asian generic look of my previous cars, but the warranty issues were not something I was used to dealing with (bad clutch at 12K, haywire windows, faulty airbag, dead radio, oil burning).  Regardless of these issues, I still love the car.  Woefully underpowered for $39,800, it all comes down to the look.  I have never been looked at more in any car I have ever owned.  My relationship with the car was so strong that I forgave all its deficiencies....almost....see improvement needs.... Live Close to a Dealer I love this car!  this is my second Audi purchase - \\rboth similar stories: In the shop every \\r4-8 weeks.  Just make sure you have \\rready access to a dealer nearby and  \\rexpect to get to know them.  But, hey, \\ryou\\'ll love the car  - reliable or \\rnot!!! Cool Fun From the moment I saw the prototype of \\rthis car I knew it was a classic.After \\ryears of lusting for it I finally \\rpurchased the red ALMS.Its a classy \\rcar, loads of fun to drive and always \\rgets a thumbs up on the road.No \\rmechanical problems after 2 years and \\rmy weekend ritual is keeping it clean. \\rI put a computer chip in it and changed \\rthe exhaust system for a little more \\rkick. A sunroof would be nice but \\rreally its a great car! Still my dream car... After 2 1/2 years of ownership I\\'m still in love \\rwith this car.  The design of this car is \\rtimeless and I can\\'t imagine ever owning \\ranother sports car.  In the twisties, it drives \\rlike a slot car (even in the rain with Quattro all \\rwheel drive.)  The interior design fits the \\roverall design theme and I have plenty of \\rroom (I\\'m 6\\' 2\".)  It\\'s surprisingly roomy for \\rsuch a small car.  It\\'s also very comfortable on \\rlong trips (no driver fatigue.)  I also like not \\rseeing multiples of my model of car everyday.  \\rSometimes I go days without seeing another \\rTT....and I don\\'t live in the boonies!   AUDI ALMS Edition TT Quattro Turbo I\\'ve had the Audi ALMS Edition TT \\rQuattro for over two years now, and I \\rstill love getting into it! Timeless \\rStyle that continues to turn heads... Can\\'t Leave The Driver\\'s Seat Oh my gosh, this has to be one of the \\rmost fun driving cars ever.  I went to \\ra car show and was strolling around and \\rfound an Audi and there was a TT Coupe \\rand i had to sit in it.  Once closing \\rthe door I fell in love.  I couldn\\'t \\rfigure out wether it was how quiet the \\rcabin was or how it felt like I was \\rgoing fast while standing still.  So \\rwhen I got home I researched them and \\rdecided to buy used and got a 2002 Audi \\rTT Coupe 225 Hp and am never getting \\ranother car until this one quits.  No \\rmatter how fast your going with the \\rquattro you can whip it in and out of \\rthe curves with no slipage and the \\rengine keeps pumping out RPM\\'s. my tt I love this car.  Fun to drive, and in \\rgood driving/weather conditions it \\rtakes care of you.  I have the \\rperformance tires so snow & ice can be \\rtricky, but the all wheel drive is \\rwonderful in the snow.  This car has \\rvery confident acceleration, and \\rhandling.   ALMS for me I\\'ve loved this car from the first day I took \\rpossession of it. With the turbocharged \\rengine, nicely matched 6-speed manual \\rand quattro all-wheel drive this car provides \\rall the performance of cars priced thousands \\rhigher. The TT is really in it\\'s element on \\ropen, twisting roads - but I\\'ve found that it is \\rfun to slalom through the ponderously large \\rSUV\\'s which congest our urban freeways! \\rThe details of this car are designed to \\rdelight - all the way down to the beautifully \\rdesigned gas filler - makes filling the tank \\rmarginally enjoyable. In the two years I\\'ve \\rhad the car I have had had no mechanical \\rproblems and only minor issues with the \\rradio system. just info I haven\\'t had any problems with the  Everyday is raceday at Le Mans Have had the ALMS for just over a year and \\ra half and i never get tired of looking at it. \\rGot the Avus silver with red leather interior \\rand its the most beautiful interior i\\'ve ever \\rseen in a car regardless of price. Being \\rsingle, this car doesn\\'t dissappoint. Great \\rhandling car, could use better steering feel \\rand weight and less turbo lag. Definately \\rneed a radar detector with this one..... Pre-Owned TT Fun, fun, fun, to drive. Wheather the \\rcar is parked or on the road, it always \\rturns heads.  Too fun to drive I traded a 1999 A4 in for this car and \\rmy first impression was wow what a \\rdifference. The car tracks as if it\\'s \\ron rails. No problems in 16K miles. The \\r225 HP turbocharged engine pulls like a \\rraped ape! There is some turbo lag but \\ryou get used to it quickly. My wife and \\rI constantly fight over who gets to \\rdrive it too work. Talk about a head \\rturner, too bad I\\'m not single again. What my Porsche Carrera 4S wasn\\'t The Audi TT ALMS is everything my C4S \\rwasn\\'t, and what I expected it to be.  \\rMy C4S was fast, handled well, and was \\rawd.  That\\'s where the similarities \\rend.  The C4S had switches from a JC \\rWhitney catalog. The wipers screamed \\rold generation VW bug.  The ALMS TT is \\rcomfortable, well built, and has \\rstorage to boot, and at about 50K less \\rthan the C4, it\\'s a steal.  Anyone who \\rcomplains about this car should buy an \\rexotic, and live in it for one week, \\rand realize what a great car they are \\rdriving Nice Little Rocket I love the TT, it is quick nimble and \\rjust a hoot to drive!  My wife love to \\rdrive it too, she thinks it\\'s the \\rsexiest car on the road.  if i could \\rchange 2 things, 1. give it more \\rpower.  I had an M Roadster and, to me \\rthe TT seems too slow for something \\rthis cool.  2. sloppy shifter.  Once \\ragain, the BMW\\'s shifter was much more \\rprecise.  Overall, we love out TT and \\rnever plan on selling. Know what you\\'re buying Purchased a 225 ALMS edition in Sept \\r02. Pros: fast, great design, ALMS red \\rand 18\" wheels, TT look is a head \\rturner; Gearbox is smooth; Trunk \\rstorage adequate in back for golf clubs \\ror Costco runs; Complaints: significant \\rturbo lag in 1st gear (much more than \\rthe 180hp), some rattles at 3K miles \\r(!!). Annoying support frame (for \\rcenter console) makes it a little \\runcomfortable for tall drivers.The \\rTT is a gocart - fast and nimble; and a \\rpleasure to drive. Great handling at \\rhigh speeds on mountain roads. After 6 \\rmonths no problems. TT puts it all into \\rone package - nimble, fast, fun and a \\rhead turner to boot. It\\'s OK, but.... The 180hp is weak.  I was going to \\rtrade mine for a 2003 automatic but \\rwithout the manual this is a dog to \\rdrive.  For the same trade difference I \\rgot a new 350Z with about $7500 in \\roptions not on a similarily priced \\rAudi. After 3 BMW\\'s and one Audi, I\\'ve \\rhad it with overpriced underpowered \\rGerman quality. No Regrets Here! Handles great and it is extremely fun \\rto drive...this car turns some heads! \\rGreat in all weather conditions. The \\rinterior warms up fast, even in single-\\rdigit temps. Drives solid like a larger \\rvehicle with the manuverability of a \\rsports car. I highly recommend getting \\rthe Bose Audio System for the ultimate \\rTT experience! The sets are very \\rcomfortable and the manual transmission \\ris smooth. A little disappointed that \\rit doesn\\'t have power seats, but the \\roverall design and engineering of this \\rcar is superb-right down to the \\rheadlight spray/washer. Definately get \\rthe 225hp rather than the 180hp. Too much fun In a world of vanilla, where every car now looks just about like every other \\rcar, the TT stands out.  The proportions are perfect.  The lines are perfect.  \\rAnd the Bauhaus approach--use good materials, include it only if it is \\rfunctional--works.  There\\'s a feeling that everything you need is there and \\rintuitive to find and use.  And, there\\'s no excess or cheap materials.  It is so \\rmuch fun to drive that it turns this 50-something into a kid again.  And, in a \\rcountry in which bigger is always better, it is emotionally satisfying not to be \\rcontributing to the \"my SUVs bigger and beefier than yours\" syndrome. happy driver a great car, it is the practical sports \\rcar, fun to drive, great in bad \\rwheather and can carry golf clubs or \\rskies Lots of Fun for Small People This car is a blast to drive.  Great \\rtraction in all weather conditions, \\rnice turn ratio and great overall \\rhandling.  It\\'s a very spunky car; \\rgood \"get up and go.\" WHAT FUN I bought my TT Quattro 3 days ago. What  Two years of fun After having owned this car for almost \\rtwo years, I have to say that I am very \\rsatisfied with the purchse. Build \\rquality is excellent, and this car ages \\rbeautifully. This car handles and \\rperforms well enough for anything I \\rtypically use it for, and there is also \\ra surprisingly large trunk once the \\rseats are folded down. While visibility \\risn\\'t great, the small windows \\rbeneficially allow little sunlight in, \\rmaking this car cooler than most if you \\rpark it outside all day. 225QC What a great car. People underestimate \\rthe performance of the TT, but it is a \\rperformer. 225hp from a 1.8 liter; \\rthat\\'s just amazing. You also get \\rworld class interior and exterior that \\rdoesn\\'t look like anything else.  225QC What a great car.

After 10 months the Audi TT has become  A best car by AUDI A great car to drive in any wheather Best car Ive owned I was hesitant to even look at a TT  Audi wins at Lemans and my garage. This is the third Audi I have owned, \\rand I love each one progressivley more \\rthan the previous.  To date I have had \\rzero problems with the car, which holds \\rtrue with the quality of my other \\rAudis.  The car is a blast to drive, \\rand garners lots of looks. best of the best: Audi TT ...I researched, shopped and compared \\rfor nearly a year. At 6\\'3\" & 245 lbs \\rnot every sports car could accomodate \\rme in COMFORT & style. The TT beat the \\rCorvette, Mercedes Kompressor, and BMW \\rZ-3. Without a doubt this is the finest \\rsports car for the dollar available in \\rthe marketplace today! one gorgeous \"steel midget\" Got stuck on the \"FORM\", but missed out \\rthe whole \"performance\" on this car. :(\\rIt took me a whole year \\'til finally \\rcould live with the turbolag issue. But \\rit\\'s legendary quattro system sure is \\rundeniably awesome, and I just fall \\rhead over heels with the handling of \\rthis \"lil\\' David\" (\"in the Goliath\\'s \\rworld\", of course !). Fun car to drive I love my TT! It\\'s such a fun car to drive. It handles well and the interior looks like nothing else you have ever seen. Simply beautiful TT at last I had been planning on buying this car for some time, and now at last I have it. I am very happy with it, only one tiny thing to report. The back panel on top of the boot creaks, but this will be replaced as soon as the replacement part arrives. Apart from that the car is just as and if not better than I expected. Great design, amazing performance... TT is King its nice TT= FUN FUN After test driving several coupes the TT is not only lots of fun in the highway and country roads but its an eye catcher for city driving. after 8 months no complaints. Wonderful TT\\'s With the exception of a few minor electrical problems this has been an excellent vehicle. at 20,000 miles the drivers electric window motor was replace and some of the electrics in the instrument panel have failed several times.\\r It is a fine comfortable touring car, and can carry a good bit of luggage with the back seat down. Trips of  up to 500 miles pass quickly. Big FAT Tall Guy TT is 15 months old and I love driving it.  The best part -- looks & comments from people --  -- \"It is a beautiful car\"! HOW MUCH\\r  I am 6 \\' 2 \" talk and a big man and I fit into this car very well.  Seats are comfortable.\\r  It handles well on the road, and on the interstate -- it is a dream.\\r  Trunk space is better than all of the other cars in it\\'s class.  We do all of our shopping in this car and I have never had a problem fitting anything in the hatchback area.  \\r  This was a big selling point for me.  It has more room than all Z3s, boxsters, and hondas etc.\\r  It is fun and it does the job and it looks good.  Most of all it makes you feel good. Great Car The TT is an amazing car.  You are guaranteed to recieve attention in this car.  I\\'d recomend it to any person looking to buy in this price range. Mine mine all mine! This is my Audi TT 3.2L quattro cabriolet.  I\\'ve owned it for multiple years now and every time I think I want to look at other cars for a possible trade, I get in and drive and realize it still holds my heart.  This is a nice little sports car that gives great handling, great acceleration and puts a smile on the face of the driver.  Every time.  I did extensive searching when I made the change from my previous car (\\'99 Sebring convertible) and was determined to have another convertible.  I looked at just about every convertible in the market at that time and no other had the combination of perks and handling for which I searched.  Once that decision was made, finding this car took another six months--there just weren\\'t that many with the 3.2L engine out there that were for sale!  I ended up having it shipped from Chicago down to the Dallas area.  Since then it has been my daily driver and I have learned all its quirks and joys.  Its acceleration is beyond fun and when I put it into launch mode, it borders on scary.  I know many complain that an automatic transmission is just boring, but for my needs I find it to be just right.  And when I want to get aggressive with my driving, going into Sport mode and using those flappy paddles is just great.            CONS:  One thing I have noted as a minus is the ease of tires braking loose during heavy braking.  It took me a while to get used to how the brakes work on this car, but once that was done, it\\'s been resolved.  My only real complaint I would lodge against the car is the navigation system, but I have the same gripe on every other car I\\'ve driven that includes it (Audi A8L, Chevrolet Impala and Malibu).  The nav systems are ALL slow to respond, much less helpful than a Garmin or other dedicated GPS.  For that reason, I\\'ve always maintained a Garmin, especially for trips.         MAINTENANCE has not been too much of a problem with this car, but I would note I have had issues with the convertible action.  While still under warranty I had the motors for that replaced.  There also seems to be a real issue with keeping the top down sensor adjusted correctly and has had to be serviced on multiple occasions.  Their statement that you can be driving up to 18 mph and open/close the top is a LIE, so much so that their technicians state I should only actuate the roof when parked on a level surface with the brake held in place.  Perhaps in the past decade they have repaired that function, but I would suspect not.  I will be needing to take it in to get this irritation looked at AGAIN.  As it stands presently, I frequently have to spend a couple of minutes lowering/raising/lowering the top until the status light goes out.  If I don\\'t it beeps out a warning that the top is not completely opened every couple of minutes--very irritating.  IN CONCLUSION, I would say this is a great little car to drive and I would recommend you try one out before just putting thoughts of a TT out of your mind since it\\'s not a BMW or Benz or whatever else you might be considering.  You might be pleasantly surprised. My Last Car It\\'s a German sportin vagan with all the driving fun that I can handle. A little hard to get in and out of but I knew that that would not be a deturant.  No back up camera so I purchased a back up camera for my Garmin, which works better than nothing. My Audi TT had only 20000 miles on it and I will only drive it occasionally so I should have many care free and trouble free miles of fun.... Assume car Reliable, fun car to drive all seasons. Last forever with proper maintenance. One year anniversary It\\'s been a year now and I still love this car.  I did have a problem with the top locking up.  Now there is a recall for that part(s). I\\'m over 6 feet but I sit comfortably in this convertible. Kicking myself for not purchasing the Audi Care Service for $740 in IL.  Maybe they will let me buy it before the 15k service? Love the paddle shifters.  Hate the Ipod interface.  I have to guess at the playlist, album, artists. My wife used regular unleaded against my wishes and it has not affected my 28mpg! Where can I get some track time and properly learn how to push this car to its limits. My fourth--and favorite--TT Three years ago, after having three TTs, I traded the last one for an A3. But when the redesigned TT model came out, I couldn\\'t resist. The 2008 coupe (3.2 quattro with S-tronic) is a step above the previous models in every respect: power, handling, styling, sophistication, fun. I especially like the smoothness of the S-tronic, which hesitated quite a bit in the last two cars I had. The larger interior is just enough to make friends say it no longer feels cramped.  Audi TT Roadster 08 What can I say. It\\'s summer time and I like to drive with my top off. I still need to get used to it since I only drove it for a week. It\\'s a head turner for sure. I couldn\\'t do that with my old car, so I am pretty happy with it. I have yet to test the S drive and the S tronic though, but the D drive has been exciting so far  Dont Drive on Redbull This car is amazing! Style, performance, and quality are all 10. The 4cyl turbo is great, plenty of kick to it.  Peformance and economy, my last fill up was averaged at 30mpg. I was hesitant to purchase an automatic, what\\'s the fun of a sports car that you can\\'t shift? However, the paddle shifters are a lot of fun, and make up for a spouse that can\\'t drive stick. The top drops smooth and speedy. Nice to be able to put it up or down when moving. The launch control feature is a blast! It will light the tires up like it had 400 horses under the hood. Great in the snow as FWD only.  I won this baby and WOW! I won a 08 TT coupe in Bixoli, MS at the Grand Casino and traded it for a Roadster with 47 miles on it at the dealer. I have had 6 convertibles before this and never an Audi (3 MGs, 1 Mustang, 1 LeSabre, 1 Miata). This baby takes the cake, it is smooth and agressive at the same time. I just love this car. It is a real eye turner also. Drives well in the city and runs like a scalded dog when you put your foot into it on the interstate. I love when the automatic spooler goes up at 75mph (you can manually do it also in town ) and people point at you with amazement as you pass. Drop dead gorgeous and a fun ride! Really wonderful except the gas mileage. After having owned three 225hp TT Roadster before I have to admit I really like the sound of the engine. Compared to the 225hp experiences before however this 6cyl consumes considerably more fuel (hwy 25 vs hwy 29). Obviously the first TT almost made me a die-hard TT fan, but there have been considerable improvements to the new generation, such as a larger trunk (no lie: it can manage two gold bags), a better top, great GPS and customizable computer. Needless to say that I just love the design. All wheel makes it a safer ride even under challenging circumstances. Too Topless My second Audi TT is red. It is a great looking car. The top has broken and gets stuck down. This has happened twice in one month. It was fixed and only lasted a few weeks. Also the passenger window doesn\\'t lay flush with the door after several repair attempts. It looks better with the window not sticking up a little. I could use some help with this. Obviously I loved the TT enough to lease another one.  I was hoping it would work well like the 2004 TT I leased for 4 happy years. Happy TT Driver I am a previous 2003 TT roadster owner and I was very happy with this car.  However, the improvements of the 2008 made it a car I had to have. I was reluctant to give up my turbo to the v6 but I have to say I have not missed it much.  This car still has quick pickup and speed whenever I need it.  I love the optional navigation, ipod interface, and bluetooth.  I also love the manageability of the cars computer view on the console.  I shopped for many months before purchasing a new car and it came down to the Z06 and the TT.  Yeah, some V8 corvette lover is laughing at me right now but bang for the buck I got the better car. I have been an owner of both cars and in the end best car won. 2008 Audi TT Nothing but fun to drive for me with the Stronic gear box and my wife can still drive it like an auto. 08 Audi TT I have only had the car for less than a month but love it. I traded an 03 Audi TT which I thought was a great car but it pales in comparison to the new one.  Extremely fun to drive but be careful, I just got my first speeding ticket in 10 years with it.  Very tight, responsive, and roomy for a 2 seater. Bluetooth has not worked properly since I bought it and am taking it back to service (again) next week. The bluetooth receives very clearly but transmission is broken up to the point the other person can barely understand what I am saying. Excessive Fun Wait -- let me wipe the silly grin off my face. How much fun can you have in a car?  Design, build, performance are all first rate.  First Audi I have owned and I am impressed.  It\\'s quick, nimble, but comfortable and accomodating.  The interior looks and feels so much better than the Mercedes and BMW we test drove (forego the standard Alcantara upholstery - the Napa leather upgrades are worth the extra money).  It turns heads wherever it goes. Just Leased an 08 TT Just got the 08 TT roadster convertible Sahara Silver with Baseball Glove leather interior, and mag ride.  I am amazed at how fun the car is to drive, being my first convertible, first german car ever, and with cornering/acceleration that is way fun.  I cannot imagine springing for the 3.2 when my turbo 4 cyl is as much fun as I\\'d want to have.  I\\'m not dragging it at the track or anything.   The clincher is that the color and style is out of this world beautiful.  I believe it\\'s an instant classic.  I\\'m hoping it\\'s sufficiently reliable, though as a 4th car (parked except for weekends and special occasions), I\\'m willing to tolerate some compromises and shop time for its charms. Love my Audi TT Mark II Took delivery in late July after ordering the 1st of May. Could not be happier. My last convertible was 17 years ago, a Silver Buick Reatta. Reatta needed more power and was much heavier than the TT and had vague steering compared to razor sharp feel now.  I flashed the chip with APR software and the car moves very responsively and smoothly. Also replaced the fogs with PIAA HIDs and put in bright amber DRLs.  I plan to install an air intake system and rework the exhaust in the near future. The car will be a project, with mods installed as they come to market. I may even put in a higher- performance turbo in the future, with nitrous being considered.  Best car I\\'ve ever had! I\\'ve had the new Audi TT Roadster for around 2 weeks and it is by far the best car I have ever owned! I\\'ve had the Z4 and the 2006 Boxster and none of the come even close to the 2008 TT Roadster. Everything about this car is flawless! Bullet Proof Great performing car...8 years of driving pleasure....no major repairs .....acceleration and auto shifts are terrific.... Nothing drives like an Audi! If you like precision, accuracy, speed then Audi TT is for you.  Don\\'t expect plush comforts. It\\'s a real sportscar! 2008 2.0 TT Bought this car used with 40k miles on her already. Paid as much for it as I could have for a NEW fully equiped GTI which is a similar car since they share the same platform, engine and technology. After almost a year of ownership I don\\'t regret buying the used TT over a new GTI. The exterior and interior styling combined with the lighter weight chasis makes the difference for me. The only penalty I feel is the cargo space but I have a second car for the days when I need it. Major big plus is that I average 400 miles to a tank and I\\'m not a light footed driver. I do about 50/50 city, highway driving and I love to get on the throttle as much as possible.  Everything I wanted and expected I\\'m very happy with my decision to purchase this car.  I\\'ve been looking at it since they came out and have just been waiting for the right price on a used one. The car is quick and handles great. It\\'s very comfortable considering it\\'s size. The interior is roomy for the front passengers. The back seats are fine for really small children for short durations. Bose sound system isn\\'t horrible,but it could use more bottom end. The only thing my car didn\\'t have was the nav. I mostly wanted it for the display and the SD card readers, but the 6 disc mp3 changer in the dash works well.  It displays text unlike the ipod interface. Torque makes driving the manual easier in traffic. The TT is a good car. My previous cars were a 2005 Lotus Elise and a 2000 Boxster S before that. I need a 4 seater for my baby son and the TT was the only car that really interested me short of a 911.  Comparatively, the TT is very capable in the real world. Its handling is decent, however the steering a bit light and there\\'s too much understeer in the canyons.  Acceleration is decent and brake is excellent.  Storage is adequate.  It\\'s a good daily driver car.  I did compare payment to a similar spec VW GTi (no interest in it but just doing due diligence) and the TT is about $125 more a month so it\\'s not a bad deal. Excellent, any way you look at it! Got this 3.2 coupe used and am loving it!  Handles like a dream and the dual clutch tranny is by far the best feature.  Would buy a 4 cylinder if buying new, but wanted to Quattro and saved.  08 3.2 was my only option for Quattro given used and value.  As for gas mileage, averaging about 22 and am happy with it.  It hard to compare the gas mileage in my mind when this thing wants to run well above the speed limit.  If you want to push it off the line every time then the numbers will drop, and yes, so will they in any car. I\\'m very impressed with the style throughout, and cannot get over the attention to detail in the beauty.  Beauty Perfect in every way. Love the headlights, tail lights, interior, exterior, and 10 spoke bicolor rims that stand out. Oh What a Feeling! I have been driving my 1995 Audi 90 for over 13 years when I upgraded to a slightly used 2008 Audi TT. Wow, what a difference a decade makes. I am amazed at the power of the 2.0T, along with the smoothnessof the whole vehicle. I\\'ve owned Audi\\'s for over 25 years, so I am a fan - but of course there are some things that could be improved. Highly Recommended! This is a nice little car. Convenient as the size allows easy parking everywhere. Gas mileage is acceptable, not as good as the 2.0 version. Interior is outstanding (enhanced leather interior), the rear seats work well with my 2 children (ages 9 and 6) for short rides. The suspension feels a little harsh (I don\\'t have magnetic suspension), which might be a deal breaker for some. However, no car is perfect and this one is not the exception.   Wife says: \"Best Car Ever\" Bought this for my wife, she needed one last sports car before we she got \"old\". She had an old 1976 Porsche 911 but loves this car better, in fact she\\'s says the TT is her best car ever.  Bought a red color coupe and she loves it. It\\'s perfect for her petite size and I know she loves getting all the attention. The handling is great, it wants to be driven and before she knows it the spolier pops up and she notices that she\\'s going 80 miles plus. The trunk is big enough for a weekend trip. I\\'m just a bit too big for the seat which is too confining for me on a long drive but it\\'s a her car and she loves it.. When Mama\\'s happy everybody\\'s happy. Great car I love to drive this car.  I had a car that got better gas mileage, and just couldn\\'t give up driving this fun sports car. Too early really to tell about reliability.  With numerous frost heave \"speedbumps\" and potholes around here, I started hearing a knocking noise in the front end when going over a bump. The dealership however didn\\'t hear it.  Of course, I\\'m still under warranty. They also told me that the 2 bent rims are \"slight\" although I have a tire/rim warranty.  The rear tires are worn out at around 17,000 miles.  They stick like glue to the road however.  Would I buy this car again?  You bet! Fun, fun, fun car This car is simply a blast to drive.  I have the basic 4cyl turbo model and it flies. Car is built to be driven hard. I have a stop and go and highway commute and its is happy doing both.  It is tight and responsive and loves to be pushed. Driving this car will actually make you smile every single time you get in. You will find yourself looking for reasons to go for a drive. Everyone will look at you in this car simply b/c there are so few out there on the road. Truly a fun car to own and pleasure to drive Stop thinking and buy it! I first saw the Audi TT on the road and immediately started to do my research. After attending the Chicago auto show, I was sold on the TT and had to have one  I now own a 3.2L 6 speed manual and can desribe this vehicle in one word: powerful.  Driving this car is truly an experience and we cannot wait to take it for a long drive. The car handles so well that I can drive 90 mph and not feel any vibration. If you are thinking of buying this vehicle, stop thinking and buy. You will love it! Fun to drive factor! My new Audi replaces a 2002 TT 225 Quattro 6 speed manual. I almost expect to have minor electrical and mechanical issues, but it\\'s a compromise when driving this great road going car. The new TT has only a few hundred miles, but it is easy to see and feel the differences. It is a better appointed interior, and the DSG has become very smooth in its delivery. The gusty exhaust note is what I listen to most when I drive, though the basic factory stereo sounds great. Bought the car for Quattro and when I had a FWD A3 for loaner, it was apparent I made the right decision. I\\'ll check back after I get through the self imposed 5k mile \"keep the RPM under 3500) break-in period. Easier said than done My Dream Car! Had my TT for 1 week and loving it! Fully loaded excl. nav and mag. ride. Was considering an \\'04/\\'05 but then saw the \\'08 and it was all over. I test drove the 2.0 but decided on the 3.2 due to power and Quattro - I expect to keep this car for a long time. Audi TT 2008 Bought the TT after having an Audi Cab for many years. Loved the car at first sight and had to have it. It has never disappointed me. Handles in snow and ice without any difficulties or worries.  THE Perfect Car I have had this car for 8 months and I still get all giddy when I see it.  I feel that the seats fit my body so well that when I sit down in them, my happy tt is giving me a hug.  Its fast, its sexy and handles well.  I have never felt that the car has put me in danger and I love how noisy the exhaust is (but its not an annoying noise like from some modified cars).  I feel bad for people who have chosen to buy other cars in its class. Sloppy transmission I have had some problems with my AUTOMATIC transmission.  When I am stopped on a hill and then try to go, the car rolls backward like I have a manual transmission.  There does not seem to be a hill-holder feature. What is maddening, is that this only happens occasionally.  I must put my foot on the brake AND gas to keep from hitting the car behind me.  When I reported the problem to the dealership, they said it was a normal characteristic of the car.    Also, the car rolls backward an inch, or so, when I put it in park on a hill.  The transmission seems loose, or sloppy.  My dealership can find nothing wrong.  I can\\'t believe this is a NORMAL characteristic of the car.  Cool winter driving & hot for the summer My first Audi. I love it. The styling blows me away everytime I go to drive. I can\\'t believe that the best car in any parking lot is my mine. Loads of room in the front and the trunk. The rear seats are good for shopping or our medium sized dog. Even if I\\'m stuck in traffic I can enjoy the elegance of this car, until, that is, there is an opportunity to use all the power - exhilarating! 2 (optional) suspension modes (sport/regular) and 4 transmission  choices (auto, sport, paddle override and clutchless manual -  great combinations. The quattro AWD drive is superb in the snow. I am hoping reliability is good but I\\'ve only had it 3 months. As an only car, for a kid free couple it\\'s fantastic Awesome! This is my first European car, and so far it has exceeded my high expectations. The styling is beautiful, the ride is comfortable and solid, it\\'s very zippy, very nimble, steering is very comfortable, fuel economy is great even if you like to accelerate quickly.  The interior is composed of high quality materials and a soothing variety of textures and finishes.  The controls are all at your fingertips and easy to operate. It also has very decent cargo capacity that is actually accessible. I could go on, but suffice it to say it\\'s a truly exceptional experience to drive! Awesome Car I have only had the car for 2 days but I am in love! After test driving several the Infiniti G35X, Acura TL Type S, BMW 328xi I was set to buy the TL-S when I stopped by my Audi dealer.  When I saw the new 2008 TT coupe, I stopped dead in my tracks - I don\\'t think there is a better looking car on the road.  I drove both the 3.2 Quattro and 2.0T and while the former has a little extra punch and impeccable handling, the 2.0T was plenty strong and nimble.  And it fit my wallet better.  I have a hard time finding any faults with the TT, but even a harder time wiping the smile off my face when driving it.  I truly think this car is a good value compared to the competition. Best Car I Have EVER Driven I drove this car today at work and I have to say it\\'s the best car I have ever driven in my life.  It\\'s really solid, stable in the corners, pretty good ride for a sports car with performance tires.  The exterior design is exceptional.  Plenty of interior room for me, being 6\\'1\" New England Tourer Much better value than the Porsche/Mercedes equivalent. A real gem at good price plus the reliability of Quattro AWD.Second TT and loving it. A True Joy to Own Expensive car - yes. But great for driving in the city, on the highway, and in the country with the top down. I have driven thousands of miles in the mountains of Colorado with the top down, over mountain passes and switchbacks. Comfortable in winter with heated seats. Slide around snow-packed corners with confidence.Great in snow as long as you have performance all season tires. 33mpg on highway. Drives like a go-cart with the sports suspension selected.Lots of positive comments on the looks. New generation Audi The new generation Audi TT Roadster is an exceptional sports car with blistering performance, superior handling and all the comfort features you could ask for. The price is high but residual value significantly tops the competitors. A must car for the discriminating buyer. First Time Audi Owner! Knew 2009 was my year for getting a convertible. Researched a number of different types from Miata to 350Z and finally Audi. Although I liked the Miata, wanted a little more and was deciding between the Z and Audi. Two major drawbacks to conisder on the Z: 1) Poor interior quality and look for what you are spending; 2) Horrible fuel economy. The Z seems to be perfect for brute power in a nice package. After spending the day test driving the Audi, decision was clear. For about the same price, the Audi delivers beauty, responsiveness, kuxury interior!! Top or down, awesome car to drive!! Also, there aren\\'t as many on the road so you don\\'t just blend into the sea of cars. Check it out. Beautiful car, some maintenance issues Outstanding interior and nice body design. The leather seats offer excellent back support. Unfortunately I\\'ve had to have the ignition switch, windshield wiper pump and the engine coolant pump replaced. Today the S tronic transmission indicator light came on and the transmission was slipping. It is in the repair shop. The dealer said it could cost over $10,000 to repair. Update: the dealer said the transmission lost fluid because of a seal leak they missed - so they fixed it at no charge. Sophisticated Sport This car loves corners.  It is fun to drive and makes my commute to work enjoyable.  I decided on the Audi over Porsche, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti and have enjoyed the decision daily. Consistently surprised at how quickly I get up to traffic speed with torque to spare when I want to pass someone. Brakes are quick to engage without being too grippy.    My wife and I had no plans to take our girls in it, but they love it.  Lots of fun to drop off at school surrounded by monster SUVs and minivans.  Booster shopping was a challenge.  For as small and low as the car is, there has not been a grocery or Costco run it has not yet been able to handle. Thoroughly enjoying my mid-life crisis mobile. Outstanding You can have the BMW\\'s and the Cayman, this is one outstanding car.  It may not have the tooth jarring aspects of a raw sports car but it is a perfect combination of luxury and performance. The build quality is typical Audi and even with the 2.0 the torque and power is more than enough.  Traded an \\'03 FWD TT for this one and I couldn\\'t be happier with the styling, performance and Quattro.  It is a real head turner and so fun to drive especially with the paddle shifters which can be used at any time in any mode.  It\\'s just a great car.   Great Package! The TT provides a great balance of performance, handling, safety and economy.  The power is more than adequate, particularly considering the great low end torque.  The S-Tronic transmission is a super design - I use it as an automatic around town and switch to the paddle shifters for spirited driving on the twisties.  I\\'ve averaged 28 mpg overall and seen 34 mpg on trips.  The quattro AWD is smooth and effective in snow.  The fun-to-drive factor is way high.  The build quality and interior and exterior materials are excellent.  This car brings a smile every time I get behind the wheel. Awesome Audi The 2006 Audi TT 225HP Roadster is a blast to drive. It handles very well thanks to AWD and can fly in the straightaways also. Cannot be Duplicated I being 6\\'2\" find it slightly uncomfortable with an upright seating position. However, this roadster provides a thrill that is unique. The power is adequate (could use a little more HP) for an amazingly light but sturdy car. The DSG transmission zips through gears seamlessly as if it was a continously variable. The contact and firm grip of the road through Quattro gives you the best position for off-the-line starts. The paddle-shifter located on the steering wheel gives a fun sport to driving but allows you to command more power (and speed) when you take the road. In addition, the convertible can set a mood for scenic cruising or \"in-car-flight.\" GREAT CAR!!! Such a fun ride, though I must say after 1 week my battery died,,kind of a fluke I guess, but other than that it\\'s been tons of fun. Handles extremely well, twin turbo really kicks in at around 4500rpm\\'s. pretty cool I traded in an \\'03 M3 for this car for a little more fun.. esp in the summer. The engine could use a little more hp but it is a blast to drive w/ great paddle shifters. Why can\\'t BMW get it right w/ SMG?? One small problem is with the seat adjustment.. you can\\'t get it to lean back any, as I am 6\\'3\" so you are sitting up pretty straight up. Had a boxster S before M3 and TT is almost as much fun but can drive all year long in northeast.. big plus for me. Another Quattro for me My 1989 Audi 100 Quattro served me well for 17 years, so when I finally decided to get a new car, Audi was the car to beat. I checked out the competition, but nothing came close.  Although the TT is much different than a 4-door sedan, it still has the quality feel and classic style I loved in my old car.  Soon after I purchased the vehicle, I set out on a 3-week, 3000-mi roadtrip to see if anything needed fine-tuning by the dealer.  Everything worked and performed perfectly. Now the new car feels like a part of me when I drive, just like my old one did. I made the switch... you should too! I have owned BMWs and several Mercedes including two SLKs and I may never go back to those brands again. I was tempted to get the new SLK, but I decided to take a chance on the TT. I definitely made the right move. From interior and exterior styling that may be years old, but still ahead of the pack of newbies to comfort and handling... once you try out this car, you may never want to drive another again. I thought my Mercedes was fun, but all I want to do is just jump into this car and run to the store for nothing at all, just to be behind the wheel. Gas mileage is great as well and the meter which tells you how many miles you have left is priceless. I would recommend getting the audio pkg. Great Car Great Car, fast, handles great, backseats are fine for small children, Great interior, comfy seats  drive it all day all year I own two of these, one for me and one for the wife.  This is simply a great car.  Fun to drive, quick, fast and very agile.  Enough room to drive in comfort and enough power to do it quickly.  Top speed of 150 mph is just a blast.  Everything is in the right place and it all works like a truly well built machine. Not a c4s cab or a db9, which I also own, but a seriously fun everyday driver.   Fun Little Car This car is incredible.  It is fun to drive for both male and female drivers.  The interior is slick and the upgrade stereo system is a must have.  Do not consider this car to be more then a 2 seater.  You can barely fit two small people in the back.  Consider the back seat to be bonus space.  It does come in very handy.  For the size of the car, the trunk space is big.  You\\'ll be surprised how big it is when comparing it to a 350z or any other 2 seater cars.  My girl friend took this car on a 5-hour trip and she was very comfortable and got incredible gas mileage thanks to the sixth gear overdrive.  We have not run into any major problems with the car.  So far it has 20,000 miles.  Fun but Risky I loved my little TT for the 5 months I owned it except I would only suggest it to people than can pay for repairs. I had the vehicle two months and the heater stopped working on it. Thankfully the dealership I bought it from understood my frustration and only charged $100. It ran very well and strong the next few months, no signs of loss of power in hard on-ramp pulls or quick passing over-takes of slow moving cars. But then, one day put her in drive and the car lurched forward and my dash lit up with several warning lights. After only 5 months, my engine had blown without any warning - and not to mention the dealer had just checked it out only 3 months prior to. It would have cost over $10k to fix if I had not had the after-market dealership warranty. But by the point I was disappointed my very fun car had been so much work after only owning her for 5 months that I got rid of her. Buy it if you want to have LOTS of fun in the sun and/or snow and have the money to fix her when she throws a fit. Ignore the reviewers!  600 miles in on an S-line TT purchased Labor Day despite the reviewers hating on it. She is practically perfect!!! My 120 mile, mostly highway commute to D.C. often becomes stop & go. It often flurries and/or rains in rush hour. She is easy to park, has good brakes, fits 2+a small dog crate w/the seats folded down, has AWD w/ a reputation for being great on wet roads & gets decent mileage. I know its not a \"real sportscar\" (we have an S2000 so I know the difference) but I think most people who think they want a sportscar really want an eye-catching fast daily driver.Strangers compliment her. Her IBIS white is extremely visible. Build quality seems as good as husband\\'s Mercedes ML. 7 Years and I Still Get Excited To Drive my TT! The only downside to this car is having no back seat. It also does lack some of the high tech toys available on the sedan models but most people by a roadster for bare bones fun. There is nothing bare bones about this fun car! The quality and craftsmanship are top notch. They use real aluminum and metal inlays and not plastic painted silver. The handling is amazing with the Quattro (all-wheel) drive system. I have never driven a car that sticks so firmly to the road.  I will never go back to rear wheel drive systems again It also has great gas mileage partially because it\\'s a 4 cylinder but the turbo makes this car go from zero to 60 in less than 6 seconds. It definitely stands out from other cars on the road! A unique design, classic style and German engineering are all you need to get your heart rate going when you hit the gas. Big performance in compact package This is my third TT and it is the best, Agile handling.Fast pickup.A lot of car in an iconic package. Unique and Fun Great gas mileage for a roadster, fun to drive and a unique looking design make this car my favorite!The sound system is incredible. Smooth ride,  set ride It needs high test to perform assy is peak.  Biy Michelin tires, made ther fixer smooth and quiet. The navigation is difficult,  probably will use google. The are no USB ports,  not made for gadgets... only one cigarette lighter charging. MMI does have connection for an Ipad in the glove box. A car you can Drive all year round There are cars you ride in and cars you drive. This is a driver. Skip the FWD car with the CVT transmission. You want the quattro version with the magnificent ZF 8HP transmission. Car feels solid like a block of granite, with little wind noise. Over MPH in winter time is around 22-25 on premium fuel. Turbo motor feels like a v6 or larger car, with no turbo lag. Interior is nice and heated seats are a must in cold climates, as is the back up camera, as the only thing you see out the back is the sky. B&O stereo is very nice but don\\'t pass on the standard Audi stereo as that too sounds goodUpdate 8/23/16 Still love the A5 but one has to wonder if the people who design these cars actually drive them. For instance the window drops down when you open the car. Know what happens in the winter when at work when it sleets out. The window freezes up and will not drop down so you can\\'t open the door, or if you can open the door you can\\'t close it. Of course remote start would help but Audi will not offer one even though  VW does. Another thing, eighteen inch low profile tires. I\\'m on the third set in 20,000 miles.  Hitting a pot hole rattles the fillings, and then you can expect side wall damage or an outright blowout. Does not matter what brand of tire either. Water pump failure at 30K would cost over $1000 if not under warranty.  Crank case ventilation valve bad at 35K have to replace the entire valve cover, really? Yep.  Warped brake rotors a 35K miles. I do love this car but, but when we went shopping for an SUV instead of buying an Q5 we purchased a Venza. bluetooth, terrible all in all, a great car. love it , but the bluetooth connection to any phone is awful! . all othermanufacturers have it figured out. i used to hink because i have the cabriolet the cause was the vibration in the pliiars, but no. its all about the microphones. supposedly they are recalling them, but its been 2 years ! come on........... i drive all day and use my phone all day. I need a bluetooth that works. I may sell the car just because oif this reason, arrrrgggg Beautiful Car, Poor Gas Mileage and Ride Lovely exterior, nicest interior I\\'ve ever experienced. I\\'m proud to be seen in this car. However, gas mileage is nowhere near EPA\\'s 21/29 rating. I get a disgraceful 16-17 mpg in town, doing little highway driving -- and I\\'m anything but a leadfoot. In typical German fashion, controls/infotainment are way too complicated, very hard to learn. Also, I find the ride very stiff and rough, especially on some of West L.A.\\'s pitted streets. This is probably my first and last Audi. (I kept my previous car, a 1996 Mercedes C280, for 16 years, and I miss its simplicity.) UPDATE, February 2016: My 3-year lease of this A5 ended in December 2014. I had said it was probably my last Audi, but my wife bought an Audi Q3 compact crossover SUV in January 2015 and I drive that (reluctantly). I miss the A5\\'s looks but not its rough ride and its disappointing fuel efficiency. Dreams wrapped in metal This car is simply amazing.It is everything you could ever want in a grand touring sports coupe.You get looks everywhere you go. The car is super smooth and gets great gas mileage.The A5 is one of the most comfortable cars I have ever owned/ridden in.The sport package is a must because the seats are that much better then the standard offerings.I look forward to many years of bliss with this car. My 13th convertible and this is the best! I have owned Triumphs, Austin Healy’s, 3 BMW’s, a Boxster, 2 Miata’s, etc., and this is by far the most overall enjoyable convertible and car I have owned.  I really liked BMW’s evolution to hardtop convertibles until I bought my Audi A5.  The soft top is every bit as quiet as the hardtop convertibles, but the additional trunk space when the top is down is significant (means I can get my golf clubs in the trunk versus back seat)!  The power in the A5 is quite impressive, and I have even gotten up to 38 MPG on the highway.  This is a very smooth driving and accelerating car, with slightly less road feel that my 05 BMW 3 series, but comparable feel to the BMW 4 series.  The technology and sound system are second to none, and I have found them very user friendly and easy to learn and use.  With the wind stop in place and windows up with the top down, there is minimal wind buffeting.  If too hot, the ventilated seats keep you much cooler (BMW does not have this helpful feature).  And the rear seats are adequately comfortable around town for adults, but getting in and out is a challenge.    This  Audi A5 will likely be a long term keeper for me, for it may be the best overall car I have driven! Work on your tan!! Fun car to drive in the summer. The acceleration and comfort of the drive is phenomenal. You’ll be doing 100 and not even realize it! The aerodynamic styling is very sharp looking. On the negative side the cup holders in front are in a bad location, they block some of the controls.  The glove box has lost some space from previous years, the owner’s manual doesn’t even fit in it. The small storage box to the left of the steeling wheel also is to small for the owners manual. The pockets on the door awkward to get items in and out. Overall the car is fun to drive in the summer (I have yet to own it during a winter season). Riding with the top down What more can you say. I bought a convertible S5 from Walters Audi in riverside and could not be more happier thanks to Todd Bellis my salesman and the financing staff. I have always wanted a convertible and more so an Audi. Here is to riding with the top down! Too New To Know This is my 4th convertible.  They were/are 1964 Ford 500 XL (a big boat of a car), 1976 Fiat Spyder (a real fun car), 1997 Sebring (a sedan with a top that went down) and the Audi 5A.  The \"car\" before the Audi was a Rav4 SUV.  (Also a couple of station wagons along the way between convertibles.)  Stepping up in size is not a problem, stepping down is taking some getting use to.  With less than one month ownership I have taken a trip from Chicago area around Lake Michigan and a second trip to Door County in WI.  I am learning that a 77 year old body is not as flexible as a 35 year old one.  Getting in, sitting and driving is not the problem.  It is getting out after a few hours of driving.  One problem is blocking the sun with the top up or down.  The driver sun screen is very small.  The Rav4 had a sun screen that when on the side window could be slide back to do a good job of blocking the sun from the side.  The Audi does not.  Most of the other \"issues\" with the car are due to lack of knowledge and education.  Hopefully these will decrease with time.  Biggest problem is finding cheap high octane gasoline for the car.  Pulled into one station where regular was $2.83 and the hi test was $3.83.  I did not buy there.  But still paying 40 to 70 cents a gallon more.  Have been told mid-grade gasoline should do an adequate job.  Will try that since it is only about 20 cents more than regular. Audi outdid themselves on this redesign This is my 4th A5 Cab. Obviously this is the first redesign. Wow !!! is all I can say. The car is fantastic, solid, bold, head turning, powerful enough, just a joy to get behind the wheel of. Yes the tech is overwhelming and lots to learn but I am getting it. Its a great combo of luxury and sport. I own a 2017 E Class Benz. That car cannot hold a candle to this one. Night and day in my opinion. Having a soft top gives you lots of trunk space even the top is down. I have seen a convertible that has more trunk space. Audi nailed it on this one. There is a learning curve!! This car is the best I have ever owned. The technology for both the entertainment and the driving systems is fantastic. It takes a little while to learn where all the menu items are and what they all do. But well worth the learning involved. And I get envious looks every time I drive it. I have read some reviews that adults can sit in the back seat. Maybe, just not if there is a driver in the front seat! Not even big enough for children back there. But it is MY convertible, so I don\\'t care. 2018 Audi A5 Cabriolet Its loaded with tech and the new design is a real eye catcher/head turner! Worthwhile Upgrade From 2014 Audi A5 Cabriolet This is my second consecutive Audi A5 Cabriolet and I\\'m an enthusiastic supporter of this car.  I traded out of my low mileage 2014 model entirely based on the migration of virtually all of the latest technology & safety features from the higher end Audi models to the current A4 & A5 platforms.  Especially important to me was inclusion of Audi\\'s version of cross traffic (rear) monitoring; although my 2014 had \"Blind Spot Monitoring\", this back-up feature was not previously available in the A5.  IMO, this is an almost essential safety feature where I live because of the number of large cars & pick-up trucks which make backing out of parking spaces a nightmare.  I also enjoy the convenience of the Heads Up Display and the Virtual Cockpit rendering of the main display.  The optional adaptive cruise control provides semi-autonomous driving and has been of great assistance while driving in the stop and go traffic conditions which I encounter on a daily basis. The 2018 model has a more powerful engine and there has been further improvement of the suspension system.  My Prestige trim level\\'s insulated cloth top now provides better sound insulation than in the 2014 model and there has been an improvement in the way in which the top stores in the trunk (relative to storage capacity).  I preferred the more classic body style of the 2014 A5, as the newly sharpened/enhanced sheet metal lines seem only to have been changed to compete with BMW & M-B.  I truly dislike what has been done to the interior of the car.  Compared to the \"quiet\" and integrated European appearance of the 2014 A5.  To me, the straight across dashboard of the 2018 looks like a mid-80s GM product.  Optional wood veneers shriek \"plastic\" and the standard shiny metal trim doesn\\'t match the other metallic components in the cockpit.  I\\'m not a fan of the new non-retractable separate (top center dash mounted) display screen which has become favored by European makers; note that this display is NOT a touch screen, but is controlled by a large (\"MMI\") knob in the center console.  It is convenient, however, to be able to show different displays on this screen and the virtual cockpit, giving the driver exceptional control of information.  The 2018 A5 accepts Android Auto and Apple Car Play and there is seamless integration of these programs with regards to navigation and media; unfortunately, Audi does not currently permit \"Waze\" or other non-media applications in Android Auto (compared with other manufacturers).   My biggest disappointment is with the lack of interior space in the cabin.  The glove box is now essentially useless, as Audi has moved the bulky CD & SD card player to that location from the center stack; there isn\\'t even enough room to put the owner\\'s manual case there (I\\'ve NEVER owned a car with that limitation).   The center console storage space is VERY shallow and not completely covered by the adjustable center arm rest; a small covered cubbyhole is provided in the lower dash to the left of the driver in a location which is not easy to safely access while driving.  Please note that Audi does not provide ANY ability to equip the A5 with an ash tray & lighter/receptacle, not even as a build option when ordering the car to specifications from Germany (this option is available in Europe).  It seems that there was little (if any) input from actual drivers regarding these convenience features.  Setting aside my complaints about the shortcomings of the interior space, I absolutely LOVE the 2018 A5.  Its combination of all precise wheel drive handling in any weather/road condition, more powerful engine and outstanding/state-of-the-art technology made it a no-brainer for me to upgrade from an already superb 2014 A5 Cabriolet. Best value for style and tech This is an amazing vehicle with so many positive aspects, the looks, style, technology,  acceleration, handeling and comfort. Only downsides I have are smaller back seats that barely handle children and unexpectedly lower gas mileage. I can only imagine it’s gas mileage was based in a cool climate where the start stop function could be utilized. I’m in AZ where the AC is used all the time so the start/stop does not work while that’s on, therefore gas mileage is closer to high teens low 20’s if you drive very conservatively. Other than those 2 items, this is an amazing vehicle! Traded for Volvo S90 It’s a pretty car but became too cramped.  I became tired of the heavy and long doors getting in and out of parking spaces, and missed having an easy to use touchscreen.  Also, the Google gps is cool but over time impractable.  I didn’t need to see stuff so far to the left and right as laid out horizontally on the dash. Finally, the Audi dealer would not refund the maintenance plan a month after we bought it.  Very inflexible dealer.  I traded for the new and much larger Volvo S90 and love it.  For the same cost, it has Auto pilot and a huge touch screen similar to the Tesla.  It also has a huge back seat and drives like the Audi and with same gas mileage.  I’m much happier with my Volvo and use the auto pilot all the time.  I no longer mess with the Audi mouse and click on my touch screen directly.  Also, the screen is vertical so I can see more of what’s ahead of me and not wasted space like in the Audi screen.  Lastly, the Volvo has amazing headlights that turn with auto bright at night that makes night look like day. Love this car So I\\'m pretty frugal. And when my 2000 Volkswagen Jetta 1.8 T finally died 17 years after I bought it brand new, I figured it was time for an upgrade.   I skipped VW and went straight to the Audi dealership. The S8 was lovely, but a bit out of my price range. The A3, with that high roof, looked too much like my old Jetta.  It would make a nice Pope-mobile. And then there sat the A5. The four door is nice but I wasn\\'t going to be hauling my family around in this car. We have a Yukon XL for that. This one is just to move my butt up and down the George Washington Parkway, alone, in comfort--it had to be a Coupe.   If you compare the coupe to the sportback, well there is no contest. I guess if you have  three kids, you may be compelled to buy the sportback, which gives you an extra seat in the middle. I have more than three kids, so I might as well have been buying a Ducati. I was a little apprehensive about the 2.0T, which powers quite a few smaller VWs in lesser forms, but this car flies: 0-60 in 5 sec.  Good enough for me, who has no plans to take it to the drag strip.  It\\'s a great car. A nice but unexciting car This is my second Audi A5 prestige model coupe. My last one was a 2010, and I loved the car - but it had gotten long in the tooth. The 2018 prestige coupe seems much better mechanically than the 2010, and both the engine and transmission are incredible. In addition, the car seems much quicker than the statistics Audi publishes, particularly in the sport mode. The steering is also very good for electric steering, and isn\\'t too light and doesn\\'t entirely lack road feel as many do. The electronics are also superb. In addition, the cabin materials are exceptional, and the fit and finish seems as perfect as a car can be. On the less than great side, the flat dash with the MMI screen stuck to it is sort of generic looking, and I don\\'t think it is anywhere near as nicely designed as in the previous model. The appearance of the interior is nice, but that\\'s about all it is. Also, the redesigned body appearance is, in my view, just okay. I used to like just looking at my dark metallic blue 2010 A5, and I thought it was truly beautiful; the 2018 model\\'s appearance is less than awe inspiring, and lacks the uniqueness and character of the model it replaced. That\\'s true of the interior design as well. Both are sort of bland, and there\\'s nothing about them that stands out from the crowd. This is a car that is very good in all respects, but isn\\'t exceptional or exciting in any respect. Audi A5 - To Drive It Is To Love It! Great design an incredible lines define this car. The sportback has incredible cargo capacity while still maintaining the look and feel of a midsize performance sedan. The technology took a bit to get use to,  but after several days of driving it became second nature and things I didn’t necessarily value at time of purchase became highly prized  - like MMI for example. Strongly recommend. Very satisfied Try the rear seat before buying, that\\'s the only drawback other than perfection. A5 Fun to Drive I have only had this car for six weeks, so it is not valid to compare resale value and reliability. Ask me in a year and I will have a better answer.  The car has less road noise than my previous TLX.  The body construction is solid and materials of construction are high quality.  Acceleration is a excellent for the engine size, especially for passing on two lane roads. The sport suspension gives an expected firm ride. Quattro handling is great.  Bang and Olufsen sound system is excellent. Audi A5 Sportback Great ride, sharp looking, tech smart sport sedan. 2018 Audi A5 Hatchback Rocks Great car.  Virtual Cockpit makes viewing map guidance a breeze.  Bank & Olufsen radio rocks.  MMI navigation is intuitive to learn.  Only took a day or two to get the hang of the system.  Considered an A-4, but decided on the A5 hatchback because of the increased versatility and giant cargo space compared to the sedan.  The extra cost of an A5 over an A4 is well worth it. Pleasantly Surprised! A few years ago I moved from a Acura TL SHAWD to a VW Golf R....I decided to venture into an Audi for other reasons.  You sometimes get HP crazed and a bit to concerned with 0-60 times.  I was pleasantly surprised by the pick up and acceleration of this vehicle.  I haven\\'t had it but three days and I am blown away by the fit, finish, craftsmanship, materials, tech, handling....I could go on.  I looked into MB and BMW as options, but the Audi\\'s have always been a vehicle I wanted to own.  The sportback is so darn alluring.  At this point I\\'m going with fives across the board unless I notice something that would have me post otherwise.  I have the Prestige model in Glacier white with the Rock Gray seats, it looks so classy. Ticks all the boxes... .almost Performance is excellent for a 4cyl, particularly acceleration off the line.  The car is very, very quiet on decent roads, and the interior is immaculate.  It\\'s not something you\\'ll use to haul more than 2 people around for more than a few miles at a time, and I knew this going in.  The storage room is exceptional for this size of car.  Quattro system really makes you feel confident on the road.  I absolutely love the look of this car both inside and out.  The base safety systems that come with this car are very nice to have.  Frustrations are few but I\\'ll note them now.  First, I wish they\\'d have made the gas tank a few gallons bigger, as I feel like range is too short if you\\'re driving in the city.  I am replacing a 2009 Acura TSX which had about a 16 gal tank, so it\\'s a bit annoying.  Second, Apple Carplay is really convenient and one reason I bought the car.  However, it\\'s glitchy.  I don\\'t know if it\\'s Carplay in general, or as it relates to Audi, but they have programming problems that need fixes.  It glitches out after Audi Presense is engaged, requiring you to unplug and replug your phone in to get it to work.  Even with a brand new Apple cord, it fails to connect at times.  I\\'ve had problems with it freezing, or crashing my phone while in the middle of navigation.  I don\\'t know if this is primarily an apple problem or an audi problem, but it can be maddening at times.  I have an Iphone 6+, so it is a relatively \\'older\\' phone, maybe that\\'s some of it.  Also, I was using 3rd party app Pandora, it could be from that.  Last complaint is that basic front of cockpit storage is pretty inadequate.  No sunglass storage, very little center console storage (probably for the better so I don\\'t stash useless things).  If I can get the Carplay glitches worked out I would say I\\'m completely happy with the car.  The virtual cockpit is fun and useful, the large on dash screen as well, and the MMI system is very user friendly. 2nd Time A5 Owner, 5 Times Audi Owner This car is a great followup to the prior generation A5. I bought the Sportback after owning the prior generation Coupe.  Feels like the same car.  The fit, finish and performance are excellent. The dealership Sewell in Houston is phenomenal.  I love the MMI navigation and controls. My only complaint is the subscription based services for the Infotainment system should be monthly not paid in 3 year blocks. Also, the entire online and app integration isn\\'t what you\\'d expect at this price point. The traditional auto makers need to take a lesson from Tesla on on-line/offline access. I was charged twice for the Infotainment subscription, Audi USA was useless to resolve and ultimately AT&T issued a refund. Pretty disappointed how Audi responded to that issue. Even the dealership couldn\\'t get them to respond. Do your research before you buy a 2017 Audi A5 Cab As a longtime Audi owner, I have been shocked and disappointment in this car.  It has been in for service 6 times in 8 months.  In addition, there have been 2 recalls.  The car drives fine, but has a constant vibraton/buzz from the engine.  The car also has difficulty shifting, and can be quite jerky at times.  While the car is fun to drive when it is acting properly, it isn\\'t worth the money or the headache. The Great. Audi Converitable Silver If it\\'s been recked an if. It was a one person owener . an test drive it . How. Many miles to the gallon it gets. In town an out. Auto like Fun in the summer, outstanding in snow if not too deep. This our second one. You get everything for the price  Great car, expensive when new, interior tech isn’t This is a great handling car with a decent fuel mileage. The interior technology is not dated, but could use some refreshing. USB ports are nowhere in the vehicle. Outstanding ride Beautiful car with everything I needed...amazing agility, surprising power, beast in the snow, incredible audio 2 years in a 2015 Audi A5 and ready for a switch PROS: Beautiful car, smooth ride and acceleration, great power for a 4 cylinder,interior is very quiet and soundproof, GREAT mileage for luxury sports car (I was back to gassing up every 2 weeks like I did with my old Corolla), excellent sound system (OUTSTANDING and impressive), excellent cargo space (especially if back seats were down; carried as much as a pick up truck), more features than my previous BMW 3 series for less $$$,       CONS: navigation does not update and would often send me in the wrong direction or could not find address (I had to use the Iphone to get me out safely), screen is not touchscreen, can not change music using steering wheel buttons, brakes squeaked after a few months/a few thousand miles and have continued to do so entire 2 years I have had, windows screech when rolling down/up, moonroof gets stuck when opening and \"thuds\", transmission problems (in first 3 gears, the gear \"jump\" when shifting up. It does it sometimes at higher speeds but is most noticeable in first 3 gears. It\\'s embarrassing and makes the car no longer fun to drive. I have taken it into the dealership and they \"can\\'t find an issue since the computer is not reporting a problem.\" I find this UNACCEPTABLE for a $45k car that I have had for 2 years/35k miles.) Roadworth+ !!!!  Fun Car! I\\'ve owned the car for about three months now.  I traded in a 6 year Acura TL which I loved.  I was a little worried about going from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder.  I as worried for no reason.  I\\'m completely happy with the torque of the 4 cylinder turbo.  And the engine is quieter and smoother than my Acura\\'s 6 cylinder.  The A5 has a great balance of sporty and fun or comfortable and smooth.  For a similar price to a BMW 3 series I get real leather interior.  I just couldn\\'t force myself to spend 40,000 on a car that didn\\'t have leather.  I\\'ve only found a few frustrating things.  I was surprised to find out that I can play music through the Bluetooth.  Really?  And the cup holder holds one and a half cups.  The half ... I have no idea what you could put in it.  The stereo and entertainment system is not as intuitive as it should be.  And the visor doesn\\'t slide or extend out to block the sun fully.I feel like this was a great purchase and have been very happy with this car! A drivers car with all the right features My wife is on her second Audi and my kids on VW number 3 so suffice it to say we\\'re fans of the Audi/VW products.  I wasn\\'t really looking for the A5 when I looked to trade my last vehicle but after driving it I was sold.  Great power for a 4 cylinder and awesome styling.  Since my wife has an A6 and previously had an A4 the controls were completely familiar and comfortable.  The A5 is a driving car and I\\'ve read reviews where people thought the controls weren\\'t convenient but they are precisely where they should be.  If you\\'re spending time changing radio stations and messing with settings then you\\'re driving distracted and should probably just pull over.  Both cup holders hold venti Starbucks cups just fine so unless you\\'re planning on an oversized water bottle no problem here.  The doors conveniently hold water bottles if you need more fluids in the front seat.  All in all this is a great car that\\'s fun to drive and looks fantastic. Definitely not worth what it costs I seldom write reviews about cars, as I truly believe that each driver is different. However, I have to say that the 2015 Audi A5 was a huge disappointment for me. Sure, the car is stylish on the outside and the performance is quite good, but Audi didn\\'t live to the expectations with the interior and controls design. I bought the A5 Premium Plus with the Technology Package.Here is the good:- Stylish exterior- Great engine performance- Good MPG performance as related to the HP of the engine- High quality interior materials- Premium sound is amazingHere is the bad:- The controls are quite confusing. It is difficult to navigate the overall controls and features. Any system that forces you to look down to find a specific button is plain dangerous. All controls for the Multimedia system are on the center console between the driver and passenger.- Voice recognition is poor, even after going through the 5-minute voice training program.- Integration with Bluetooth devices is poor. I had to constantly turn off and turn on the Bluetooth on my iPhone for the car to pick it up. It does not happen on my wife\\'s Honda Odyssey.- Maps on the navigation system are quite old; streets that are over 3-years old do not show up on the map.- There is only one usable cup-holder on the front. For some strange reason, Audi decided to include a cup holder in which only a baby bottle would fit.- No touch-screen functionality. Everything is controlled through a joystick in the center console, forcing you to look down whenever you want to adjust anything on the car.- If you use Spotify, Pandora, or any other music service through Bluetooth, the system does not allow you to skip tracks with the steering-wheel-mounted controls. You have to use the center console.- The steering-wheel controls are track-wheels instead of levers and buttons. They are very sensitive to the touch and you have to be careful not to roll the wheel more than one notch.- No USB ports. Only SD card slot (who uses a SD Card slot for music anyways?)I got rid of my Audi A5 just after 9 months. It was just to uncomfortable and awkward to control. Hope this review helps you. Great car Best convertible on the market. Very solid car? Fun to drive Fun car The car is just fun to drive. It\\'s a roadster built from the ground up and drives like it. Convertible Top Broke Twice in 2 years - dont buy! gGot a pre-owned car - convertible top broke down twice in 2 year - STAY AWAY.  CostGuard is refusing to cover the costs, while it\\'s clearly covered.  DONT BUY COMPLETE COVERAGE - RIP OFF. Audi-awesome car Amazing car, luxury, comfort, and great looks-pleased for 3 yrs and NO issues at all A5 Convertible is a delightful year-round driver! My 2013 Audi A5 has been a delight to own.  The car is incredibly functional with all wheel drive, comfortable interior, great looks and good fuel economy.  The convertible works effortlessly, and it is incredibly quiet with the top up, as well as warm during the winter.  The attention to detail is exceptional with high quality materials and options that will impress most drivers.  The car is very competent on the road at high speeds, but does equally well as a relaxed touring car at slower speeds with the top down.  I never thought I would ever enjoy owning a car like this, especially driving it year-round!  I picked mine up used with very low miles, and for the price it was just too good to pass up.  It still has the balance of the factory warranty, and the dealer has been great so far.A few highlights: The Bang and Olufsen stereo will not disappoint, even with the top down.  The MMI Nav system has an incredible amount of features, but it does take time to master, so keep your owner\\'s manual close.  The heated seats coupled with the neck warmers and wind deflector will keep you cozy with the top down even on very cold days.  The Quattro system is incredibly competent on slippery roads.  This is just such a complete package in a convertible that\\'s designed to be used as a daily driver.Audi\\'s quality seems to have increased significantly in recent years, so hopefully the car will stand the test of time.  So far I have had great luck with the dealer for servicing.  Seems as though Audi is trying very hard to compete successfully against the other luxury brands.Update on 7/19/16:  Been putting a lot of miles on the A5, and now at 21,000.  It continues to be a great car to own.  I did need to replace the tires though because of an alignment issue which caused the Pirellis to make a lot of noise.  Other than that, it has been pretty much a trouble free ride with up to 30 mpg on the highway.  It\\'s an easy car to live with on a daily basis.Update on 1/20/17:  Miles are now at 27,000 and the Audi continues to be trouble free.  I put a set of Michelin Alpin Sports on for winter, and the car is wonderfully competent on slippery roads.  A small disappointment is the sound quality of SiriusXM, especially when compared to HD FM stations and CDs.  SiriusXM does not allow the sounds system to show off all it can truly do.  Other than that, I do enjoy owning this vehicle a lot.  I can\\'t wait until it\\'s warm enough again to put the top down!Update on 1/23/18:  Miles are now at 42,000.  The last year has been relatively trouble-free with the A5.  The only issue was a bad fuel injector that was replaced under warranty.  Other than that, the car continues to be a delight to own and drive.  The mileage continues to be very good, it\\'s always enjoyable to drive, and it goes like a tank in the winter.  If you\\'re thinking about purchasing an A5 cabrio, I would highly recommend it.  It\\'s a very easy car to live with regardless of the season. Awesome AWD, fun, road-gripping, head-turning SO NICE to own something that under-promises & over-delivers... in spades.Total blast to create some G\\'s in every direction... including when it\\'s wet or snow roads(!).Simply outstanding style, safety, & sizzle.  Most well-thotout vehicle i\\'v ever owned (& that includes alot).Be smart/safe & make sure warranty covers U for awhile &/or add an (expensive-but-worth-it) extended warranty.   Even tho rarely needed,  Audis are NOT cheap if they break. Note to all: Prestige trim is best, NOT Premium Plus. My cherry bomb! I\\'ve only had my Audi for two weeks, but I love this car.  It definitely can get out of its own way, but on the average it gets 30 mpg.  Much better than my Passat (but I\\'m still keeping that too).  It\\'s about as quiet as my Passat when the top is up.  It has useful storage with the back seats down.  This will be my daily driver in PA, and it\\'s quite capable of doing that. 50+ Guy\\'s Dream Car 2010 Audi A5 2.0T Quattro Cabriolet is a very satisfying car. I love to drop the top and drive this car, if I do not have an errand, I\\'ll cruise to Home Depot for a stroll. It\\'s a bit underpowered if you want to be the first off the line at a redlight, but all the looks and functionality far make up for it. Regarding a comment about the soft top wearing out early, I cannot support that review. I\\'m on the original soft top at 77000 miles and it show no wear or disintegration. Plainly stated, it is fun drive and my best car buy of my life.UPDATE: I\\'m now a 60+ guy. I still have the same love for this car. I \"find\" opportunities to go to Home Depot so that I can drop the top and enjoy the Spring weather in Texas. Sadly, the glue that held in the back window failed and of course we had heavy rains. I ended up replacing the soft top and the interior carpet. The good news: my State Farm Insurance covered it.  For me, this car is part of \"Living the good life!\". A sow\\'s ear Before you buy this wonderful car, please be aware that your convertible top will desintigrate in about 25,000 miles. It will cost you approximately $ 8,000 to get a new one. My dealership got it down to $ 4,000 .I am suspicious . It is not covered in the warranty.Otherwise I have enjoyed driving this car. It is a 2010 A5 with 25,000 miles up. I am hardly ever here hence the low mileage. It is parked in the garage of my building. It does not receive any bad weather and is hand washed.My only other gripe is that you cannot pop the trunk from inside the vehicle. I was going to buy another Audi . Maybe an A7 .  Now I am thinking that because Audi made no attempt to explain why my convertible top had to be replaced .I can no longer trust Audi . If that happens , what else could happen? I am now looking at BMW , volvo , and Jaguar.Just beware. Go For Quattro Dreamed of car since Nov. when seen at auto show. Beautiful car, lots of comments.  Only wish I had opted for Quattro.  ENORMOUS amount of torque steer and cvt is not very enthusiastic or enjoyable to drive for this price.  Wish had test driven quattro more, but in short supply at dealers.  Have had top issue from factory not installing hydraulic lines for top appropriately.  Otherwise, I love this car.  Would have given up some of the fantastic millage for performance and real transmission.  Audi missed here and now I can\\'t afford to change. Quattro would have been perfect, as I had opportunity to drive quattro while mine was being repaired.  Radio/climate controls take attention from driving Audi A5 Cabriolet Exceptionally comfortable ride. Handles well in town and on hi-way. Soft top allows golf club storage in trunk with top down or two carry-on bags for weekend travel.  MMI intuitive and ergonomically organized.  Safe, smooth transition from radio, cd, dvd, nav, phone.  Looks great.  Engine solid with no sense of gear change in CVT.  Not as powerful from a dead stop through an intersection but quick and agile on highway.   A5 Premium Plus convertible Thoroughly enjoying wonderful machine with Premium Plus Package and NAV.  It handles superbly and is absolutely a pleasure to drive especially for tall people (I\\'m 6\\'4\"). Incredibly quiet with top closed and the baseline Bose sound system is amazing.   Great Convertible Just picked up my 2010 Audi A5 Cabriolet. I traded in a 2004 A4 Cabriolet. The new car is white with brown interior and brown top. It is a beautiful car and the bonus is a decent trunk as compared to the Lexus, Infiniti, BMW & Volvo hardtop convertibles which have little or no trunk room.   Lots of Fun I traded in an A4 Convertible for the A5 Conv. Quatro.  This is a great car. I had 6 cyl. before, this is just as powerful.  B&O Sound is excellent, very quiet car and just plain fun to drive and no issues so far. A5 Cab Just picked up an A5 cab about a month ago--great car!  Traded in 08 TT with 6 cy and quattro, so miss that a bit, but this is very elegant.  Still very hard to find right color/option packages, and quattro very hard to come by.  But, got the pearl blue and cinnamon interior...rare and gorgeous!  Wanted the comfort package as well, but alas, couldn\\'t find the right combo that had that as well as Bang & Olufsen stereo....got a terrific deal from our very professional dealer! Awesome I have only had this car 1 week. The looks, the compliments are too many to count. The ride is very comfortable. The B&O sound is incredible. The engine is very quite and this car does not perform like a 4 cylinder. There is more room inside than you can imagine. The seats are very comfortable. There is a lot of room in the trunk and the two back seats fold down. You can fold the top storage area up to allow more room. Enough room for two golf bags. There is a screen you can attach behind the seats when the top is down to prevent drag. update on ownership first, nothing has broken and the car drives well. no rattles. BUT, this make, model, year has known reliability problems. a repair shop quoted me $4k to proactively repair/replace parts known to fail because of poor design. i am putting the repair off. driving the car extra gently. blue book is $13K. Lovely Car..But a Gateway Drug My A5 has been a great car: reliable, good for all kinds of weather (got me home in a driving snowstorm a couple of times) and eye-catching (guys give me the envious \"Nice car!\" pretty regularly.)It also knows how to get out of its own way: my favorite \"sport\" has become seeing how fast I cam merge (aka: come up to 60 mph) on my local highway.This car does pull at the leash: whereas my Range Rover (350 hp) is perfectly happy to lumber along at 35 mph in town, the Audi seems insulted by such speeds. My only complaint (albeit weak) is that all this performance in a 4-cylinder has made me want an R8.I have a feeling that was Audi\\'s plan all along :) Since its  Since it inception. I have always wanted this car. I was able to get a great deal on a 2010 in Deep Sea blue with the Premium Plus package. It has not let me down. I love cars but I have never actually had a car that I wanted. I just picked nice cars. As my tastes and desires grew for the kind of car that I liked. Audi created the A5 and it brought all my desires to fruition.  love my car Owner of a used Audi A5 3.2l quattro.It is so much fun to drive.Cannot explain the rush you feel while driving this well oiled precise machine.So many head turns and ooooo and Ahhhhhh when they see this car.Audi quality is number 1. My first car =) I got this car on my birthday and it\\'s the talk of my High school! Fun to drive LOVE the MMI. Has a lot of get up and go! Awesome stereo and beautiful interior Ex Beamer Adict I bought this car primarily for its looks. At least once, usually twice a day, I am approached by strangers admiring the car. It rides somewhat more comfortably than the five 3 series I have owned. I got the S-line and love the wheels and handling. A 3 series will out accelerate and out handle but never out cool the A5. Buy this car if you appreciate refinement over edginess. I love it. Pimp ride I cannot imagine a better car for my needs.  Surprisingly large trunk.  Style is killer; lots of comments by folks in my office building.  There was a sunroof rattle and pass. side window air leak that needed to be repaired.  Oil consumption is about 1 quart every 4500 miles, so you need to fill it between the 10k oil change intervals after 5k miles.  Car is comfortable, navigation and voice control work nicely.  When you fill out satisfaction/quality surveys you feel Audi has designed to satisfy all respects of it.  For example the steering wheel material feel is tremendously satisfying, and I never thought of this until I bought this car.  36 mpg 90% highway and 28 mpg local roads. Audi Grand Slam Live in Germany and ordered my 2010 A5 2.0T 6 Speed Prestige in Aruba Blue and Linen Beige Milano Leather. I order  the car loaded with the Almond Beige Ash Trim that looks great, and Driver Assist and Drive Select Packages.  The leg room beats out the Jag. XF, Corvette, Merc E350 Coupe, and many other I was considering. The 211 horses mated to the Manual 6, is plenty to keep up with the other vehicles on the Autobahn.  The ability to simply walk up to my A5 and never touch my key as I drive off, Priceless. I rented the S-Line package before purchasing and can say the seating is definitely more comfortable and an overall better vehicle without it.   Out of the world After driving first 1500 miles decided to Post a comment. The car is fantastic, love every minute of driving, style, performance. Had VW passat 6v, worried if a5 is agile enough with 4 cylinders. No more worries, delivers enough power not to feel a difference. Car just glued to the road, no body roll at all.  Sleek, solid, & quick! I\\'ve had my A5 for about a month now, and I really like it. It\\'s a very solid & quiet car (much more so than the BMW 3), and plenty quick. With the turbo 4, I do not miss having a 6 cyl at all, and I am averaging in the high 20\\'s mostly around town. This car is gorgeous inside and out. It looks like a car costing 30 G\\'s more. The B&O stereo upgrade is well worth it if you are a music lover. It\\'s the best car stereo I have ever had and MUCH better than the Bose units in Infiniti or M- B. I do not find the MMI interface to be too difficult. Yes, it has a few extra steps, but all in all the sound is so good, that I will make the extra effort. High speed stability is amazing. Love it! What a beauty! After driving my 1992 original Lexus coupe that I adored, for 18 years, it was time for a new car, which had to be another coupe. The only one that interested me was the Audi A5, and after driving it there was no question that this was the car for me! Sporty, but not too small, extremely fun to drive, and have only seen maybe two or three others since buying it last year. Can\\'t wait to take it to Big Sur this summer, on a road trip up the spectacular curves of Highway 1.  Fantastic Car The car is amazing. Ample power, smooth, and incredibly sexy. The hottest looking coupe. The admiration from others keep coming. Love the technology in the car, MMI is great.  2010 Audi A5 2.0T 6AT | Brilliant Black/Black w Dark Walnut Trim | Premium Plus | Nav Plus A nice change to the typical coupe I was in the market for a fun car and wanted a coupe. Everyone, and their mother has a 328i, C-class, and G37, all for good reasons. If you want a car that\\'s a complete eye catcher, decent fuel economy, and just fun to get in everyday, this is a great choice. The only thing it lack is a little more power. That is easily fixed with an ECU tune, bringing the car from 211 hp to 240, and 258 tq, to 333 tq. That is is more tq than an S5, and makes the V6 middle option a complete waste of money. My initial ratings are with the car straight from the factory. Since the ECU tune, my I would rate it a 10 for performance and fuel economy.  2010 Audi A5 Premium Plus 2.0T Automatic Rides like a dream, great almost overly-engineered features and gizmos. Takes some getting used to the lumbar support if you\\'ve come from a car without one.  Hard to get in and out if you\\'re old or big.  Otherwise a great car to drive. Good so far Well, my 99 olds Alero blew a head gasket, so I decided to treat myself to this car as a birthday/midlife crises gift. Enjoying it immensely.  With the Alero, driving was simply a matter of getting from point a to point b. With this car I take pleasure in driving. I am 6\\'2\" and appreciate the headroom, about the best in any coupe. Very quiet/low nvh cruising on the highway. Wonderful bang&olufsen stereo. It is not a rocket, but plenty of power. With all wheel drive, it tracks well though I don\\'t toss it around. Still learning to use all the bells and whistles, and there are many. Marriage of Design and Speed They car is amazing. Even though it\\'s a 2.0 L engine, the turbo gives it more than enough power to let you have fun while not guzzling the premium gas. The cockpit is well designed too. The designer designed the dashboard not only for the driver, but for the passenger as well. Because I just purchased this vehicle, I cannot say anything about the mechanical issue. As of now, it has been treating me very well.  Also, one note is that I bought the \"Prestige\" and \"S-Line\" packages for my A5. Just ugraded from my 2000 A4 to an A5 I am loving my new car. I decided it was finally time to replace my old car (2000 Audi A4 Quattro Sports package)  which had hit 10 years and 210,000 miles.  I was looking to go with a new A4 and took the A5 for a spin and fell in love. Much nicer feel interior. I purchased the Premier plus with Nav/MMI system, upgraded leather seats and a bunch of other options i didn\\'t need but the only way I could find the deep Blue color A5 I wanted within 100 miles was to get them  I cant wait until my 1st 1000 miles are up and I can open it up fully, but thus far I am very happy with my purchase. Turns out I am the very first purchaser at a new Audi dealer in Chantilly VA that is associated with the Tyson\\'s corner, VA HBL Audi i bought my original A4 from. What a Car! This car is absolutely phenomenal.  The looks, the handling, the acceleration. Oh - did I mention that the B&O stereo is out of this world? Worth every dollar! I have been researching this vehicle for a long time. I have owned many BMW\\'s and a couple of MB\\'s, but this baby is something else. The A5 3.2 has two personalities, one the one hand, it\\'s elegant and chic. On the other hand the A5 3.2 is ruthless. When the car is in Sports mode, the car is angry but with confidence. The Quattro AWD adapted from the Lamborghini Gallardo grips the road, as if it is going to tear up the asphalt. The cockpit interior design hugs the driver in preparedness to launch like a skunk work black-ops project. The A5 is a fantastic vehicle. If you can afford it, get it! A5 coupe driveability and performance The Audi A5 is a headturner. You must be social to buy this car because you will get stopped at gas stations and traffic lights.I have been driving this car for 2 months and it seems to be the only one in the area. Not many cars balance performance and drivability like the A5. You can drive it like a sports sedan or with the help of manual shifting or sports mode, drive it like a pure sports car.The car is glued to the road and loves to be thrown into corners. Ruts or uneven road are not a problem. Highway driving is smooth as butter. All of this and 26-34 mpg in a very powerful 4 cyl with only 211 HP but an incredible 258 lbs of torque.Very happy with this purchase . 3.2 Prestige - Fully Loaded, FTW! I\\'ve had my car for almost 3 months now.  Had been wanting one for almost 24 months prior to purchase.  By far, this car is nothing short of first class elegance and sportiness.  Lots of stares, thumbs-up, and vehicle inquiries wherever you go.  Ordered mine in Quartz Gray with Light Gray interior with Prestige and 19\" Sports Package.  I checked all of the options boxes with the exception of the adaptive cruise control.  Drive Select makes this a totally different vehicle.  This car is definitely built for long haul journeys.  I live in Texas and have already driven it to SoCal and back just recently with no complaints and nothing but smiles.  Gorgeous car that will make any owner proud! Don\\'t underestimate this turbo-4 Wasn\\'t expecting much out of a 4- cylinder engine but this actually puts out more torque (258 ft-lb) than most 6- cylinder engines in its class.  It feels faster than my old V6 and the 0- 60 numbers prove it.  All I can say is if you have doubts, test drive the car yourself and you won\\'t be disappointed unless you drive a V8 or something. Just got a \\'10 Beautiful car inside and out. Many heads turning to catch a glimpse.  Love the sport rims and tires. Very sturdy and smooth.  V6 has good power and torque.  Quiet cabin.  Lots of trunk space.  Comfortable sport seats.   LOVE IT! I have owned this magnificent piece of machinery for over 1 month now and I love every time I get in it. The amazing look the car and the handling is great, it is by far the best car I have ever driven. A5 Something to Look at I have owned my A5 for approximately 1.5 months.  By far, the best car I have ever owned.  It seems like everyone has a BMW 3-series or Benz, but there simply are not that many A5\\'s on the road which makes the purchase a little more meaningful.  The car is very muscular looking and low to the ground. Even the view from the back is exciting.   Can\\'t wait to see how the Quattro handles the Ohio winters.  The interior oozes class, get the wood inlays, if you can, as they are quite a sight to behold, much like the car as a whole.   Buy two -- now! VERY pleased with my A5 Premium Plus!  Upgraded nav is much improved - with it and 2.0T, it was easy decision to go with 2010.  Easier still was A5 decision - best looking car on the road.  Performance is plenty strong enough, turbo can take a little getting used to.  Brakes good but grabby at slow speeds.  Ergonomics & build quality are also top notch.  Back seat access isn\\'t great (not bad -  it\\'s great for a coupe) but room when in is satisfactory.  Mileage is adequate if gentle - it\\'s a function of fun:  more fun, lower mileage.  No question: best awd coupe for <$75k. Incredible Vehicle The A5 design is outstanding and draws a lot of attention.  Have had several people roll down their windows at a light and ask me about it.  The 2.0T engine provides all the power needed and gets exceptional gas mileage... I\\'m getting approximately 27 mpg on highway at more than highway speeds.  Comfort: I have the sport package and the extra thigh support is outstanding.  Highly recommend it.  Plug  the IPOD into the Bang and Olufsen system--it rocks.  With this car in short supply by dealers.. Audi has a winner.  And it just keeps getting better with this manufacturer.  BMW and MB-- move over... Audi is HERE. Love it all Fantastically fun car to drive. 2.0T is an amazing engine that seems like it\\'s a lot more powerful than it is supposed to be. The S-line interior is perfection. This car feels special all over. A great value This car is much distinguished with cleaned lines and ergonomics.  I am very pleased. The car handles very well on wet surface and cornering. The back seat looks small but don\\'t be fooled. It can seat two grown persons comfortably. The 2010 Coupe comes with 4 cylinders for good fuel economy but with the \"turbo\", you will get enough power on demand to make you smile. Definitely a great buy.  Baby Got Back What can I say. Baby got back. Love this car. Have had my eye on this for a year now. Was leasing a 2004 Ls430- great car but compared to this, It was nothing but a mom and pop luxury vehicle.  This baby momma-Hugs the ground and whips around corners flawlessly, even in the rain. The price has come down on these due to the change in option for v4 2.0 or v6 3.2. Handles well with v4 option for 2010. Have no regrets. Beautiful lines and performance. Great interactive monitor and sound system. Won\\'t disappoint you. The A5 has got serious back-baby. WOW....Love this car!!! I bought this car 1 week ago and I love driving it. I just got my windows tinted and it makes the car looks really nice. One thing for sure is that it gets a lot of attention and stares from people, if you don\\'t like that...do not buy this car. I love driving this car on the freeway...can\\'t stop putting the petal to the metal...lol...I know a speeding ticket is coming soon. The car came fully loaded except for the Prestige and S package not installed. I love the NAV and Back-Up Cam on this car. Audi really improved the NAV System. It\\'s very easy to use and accurate in getting you to your destination. This car makes it easy to chat with girls! One look and it\\'s an easy conversation starter!! German engineering at its best German engineering at its best.  The Audi is a smooth handling car with great looks. The technology is first class and intuitive.  It does take a little time to gain mastery. It was a good bargain as well. I recommend it highly. Not that comfortable The sport seats are very uncomfortable.  Your left knee hit hard plastic when driving, I use a small pillow to cushion my knee. The car sits to close to the ground, hard to get into and out, also watch for parking bumpers. Insanely fun car to drive Wow. First time buyer of this level of vehicle with little to say negatively about it. Had it more than a year. USB port is a problem although the cigarette lighter with adapter works. MMI in this car is ok but not as intuitive. I use navigation daily as I drive a lot for work and find it serviceable. But the ride, the handling, the lux feel all make this a super insanely great car to drive everyday! Makes the most mundane travel special and enjoyable. The trunk is HUGE!  I have 3 grown sons and all 3 fit ( mr 6’2” / 220 sits in the front but 5’9” /170 fits either)...driving it is very fun I love this car Not a lot of backseat room. Leave the kids at home. jackclt  First time Audi Owner This is my first time owning a luxury vehicle, so I can only compare it to the test drives I’ve taken of the competition. Overall, I am very impressed with the vehicle. The car has an incredible grip of the road, the acceleration is superb, and the torque comes in handy when overtaking others on the highway. I got the premium plus with tech package, so it came with bang and olufsen sound system which has a fantastic sound quality. I only have one small complaint with the navigation, compared to my last vehicle, it\\'s a bit confusing and feels outdated. Over all, I couldn\\'t be happier with my purchase. ***Update***I’ve owned the car for just over two years now, and unless I all-of-a-sudden go broke, I doubt that I will ever get anything other than an Audi. Two years, 45,000 miles, and one long move half-way across the country, and the car is still exciting every time I drive it. best 9 year old car around best car I\\'ve ever owned Sexy By far the sexiest car in 2008 and 2 years later still holding its sex appeal. Fun to drive, ahead of the design curve. Turns heads like Kim Kardashian\\x92s backside.  The six speed manual has some punch, especially in 2nd and 4th gear at the right speed and RPM. The 19\\x94 wheels are sporty yet classy and often get mistaken for aftermarket wheels. The most impressive design feature is the cars stance. There is little overhang, fine European lines and the stance of a muscle car, simply beautiful.  If Steve Jobs makes cars, it would be A5 I am an \"early adopter\" of the A5 in early 2008.  After nearly a year of ownership, the car is holding up well.  I have had no mechanical problems except a burned-out LED light that was replaced and have noticed no rattles in the car after 12,000 miles. A driver\\'s car The Audi A5 is a terrific diver\\'s car. While I would prefer a little more horsepower, I love the way the car handles the road.  The nav sys needs to be updated, but other than that, the interior of the vehicle is first rate.     My 3rd Audi - and the best yet This is my 3rd Audi and to say that I am sold on the brand is an understatement! I got the A6 (new design) when it came out in \\'05 and loved it. When I saw the A5 and drove it, I had to have it.  Yes, we all have egos. It is OK to acknowledge that. I get more looks and thumbs up in this car than any other I have owned. Great car and beautiful design lines. Only thing I would change is transmission shifting as low acceleration - it can be a bit jerky.  If you haven\\'t driven one - do it! Inspiring! This car is incredible. You cannot look at it & not be moved or inspired. Anyone who loves cars immediately gravititate to its inspiring curves and uniqueness, a classic. People are just drawn to its stunning design.  Better than the S4 Cabroilet I have driven the A5 since turning back my S4 since May.  Wow, what an exciting car this is!  I like it better than the S4 and find the power to be almost the same. This car is so well engineered with the weight distribution that it allows the 6 cylinder engine to put like a kitten. Gas mileage is reasonable, the running lights are amazing, the exterior design is nothing short of superb, and the interior is both roomy and driver friendly. I could not be without the backup camera due to neck surgery that will not allow me to turn my neck. The backup camera and assistance in backing up are a life saver, as well.  I cannot say enough about the A5\\'s drive. I am in love. This car rocks This car is the best handeling car I have ever had the pleasure to drive. I purchased an A5 not the S5 after I had driven both. I could not justify the price difference. I ordered it with the s line package and could not be more pleased. This car is rock solid and handles great. Highly recomend taking a test drive.  First time I\\'ve ever loved my car I\\'ve had my A5 for almost 4 months now, and I still spend a couple moments to admire it before I get in to drive each day. I drove it through the mountains this weekend and had so much fun that I was actually laughing out loud. The handling is great, it\\'s totally comfortable and even has enough room in the back for a child seat. I haven\\'t had a single complaint come up.  And yes, it definitely turns a lot of heads when I\\'m driving it through town.  It actually took me a while to get used to all the stares - not that I\\'m complaining. A5-Star Rating! Having never owned a luxury car, this is my first and it did not disappoint my idea of what Audi luxury (or any other manufacturer for that matter) is all about. It is also my first production coupe ownership as well (if you don\\'t count my replica kit roadster.) The exterior of the car is in a class all it\\'s own. It takes some sports car queues and blends them into the coupe in a way no other manufacturer has done as of late. The main attraction are the LED\\'s. People stare, point, stay glued to their rear-view mirrors. The stance from the rear is elegant yet very strong with the 255 wide tires!  Interior is simply first class for me. My first leather interior. I love this car. People Crash For It I have owned this car for a couple of months now, and all I can say is wow. Though it is down on horsepower compared to the BMW 335, it completely makes up in looks. Two months ago, I was at a stop light on a main road. A man was too busy looking at my A5, he drove into the car in front of him. I love the fact I got parked in front of the restaurant by valet. I love that I cannot go a night without a compliment, I just love the car. First month update After a few weeks of ownership, I have learned that the A5 continues to impress, and truly is the beautiful girl whom you can marry and live with. The most amazing epiphany is remarkable fuel efficiency that exceeds EPA estimates of 18 and 27. I have averaged 26 in city, 34 on highway! My weekly trip to Costco also revealed I could transport abundant cargo; 3 large boxes of diapers and baby wipes, detergent, gallons of juice, and more.  My first impressions My first week with A5 reveals it\\'s a well-made car. Exterior design appears even much more beautiful in real life than the pictures. Walter de Silva (designer) was right when he says A5 is his best design. Interior design is peerless, controls perfect and intuitive, fit and finish defines fit and finish. Audi design doing in the auto world what Apple computers did in the computer world. Performance of the V-6 is not as robust as the BMW 335i coupe, which was the other car to choose from.  However, A5 is powerful enough for everything besides drag- racing.  I\\'m in heaven Drop dead gorgeous. Da Silva is a genius. This is my first Audi (but coincidentally, this is the 6th among my whole family).  Almost bought the 3 series and then saw the A5 was coming out in the states. The outside is absolutely stunning, the inside design is beautiful but ridiculously comfortable. I drive 3 hours a day going to and from work and my commute couldn\\'t be any more fun than it is now. Audi\\'s made me a fan for life. Outstanding All I can say is if you are thinking about buying it and you have the money to do so do it.  it is the nicest car I\\'ve owned and I own many cars including BMW\\'s and Mercedes. When you drive down the highway the amount of brakelights you see in the opposite direction as the try to catch a longer glimpse of you is astounding.The car is amazing, I love it! Best Luxury Coup - Audi A5 The A5 is a truly exceptional car. The finish and fit is perfect.  Absolutely no imperfections. The suspension is firm but not harsh with very slight oversteer. It is comfortable, fast, and gets a lot of attention everywhere I go. The fuel economy is better than the ratings indicate. On a recent 1400 mile trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Gainesville GA and back, I averaged 30.85 miles per gallon at 80-85 MPH.  Unreal Forget turning heads, this car snaps necks. I have only had the car 2 weeks, but there is nothing I am not thrilled with.  The value, drive, style and technology are all superior to any other car I considered.  I originally wanted an S5, but just cannot justify the extra ~90HP given the fuel economy difference.    Almost perfect I am a huge fan of Audis, and this one takes the cake. It\\'s got a gorgeous body shape (kudos to Walter de\\'Silva), perfect watchmaker-quality interior, and is oh-so-fun to drive.  It\\'s not a barnburner like the S5, but it\\'s more than adequate for me and will save me a few speeding tickets. I\\'ve had so many second glances, head turns, and people stopping me in parking lots and traffic lights to ask about it.  I actually like the fact that they\\'re very rare and will slowly trickle onto the market over the next 1-2 years. For people who like to blend in the crowd and follow the status quo, then go buy a boring BMW (with crap interior and total crap stereo/tech). This A5 is for me! Best I\\'ve Ever Owned This car is truly the first car I\\'ve ever been excited to own and to drive. The exterior design is breathtaking, the interior quality is phenomenal. If you\\'re looking to have adults ride in the back seat, this isn\\'t the car for you (especially if you\\'re tall like I am). MMI much easier to use that BMW\\'s iDrive; iPod integration and Sirius satellite makes the 6CD changer almost an afterthought. Cellphone with Bluetooth integrates in seconds. Manual 6 makes the most out of the engine; I recommend it over the 6A (the gimmicky faux manual in it isn\\'t that exciting). Trunk is huge, overly large for its class.  Wow - What a Surprise! I\\'ve owned everything from Porsche 911 to the Cayenne Turbo, from Lexus SC430 to BMW 745i and Mercedes CLS. For the money this new AUDI \"Rocks\". Don\\'t sell the 911 but for everyday zips to work this new A5 not only saves a little in gas but offers on nice comfortable ride. If you like all the bells with true performance then this car is for you and if your luck to own, you know what I mean. Thanks Audi! New A5 Owner Owning and driving this vehicle is like a breath of fresh air. Despite the fact that it\\'s a lot of fun to drive, the positive attention that is received is unbelievable. I was surprised that certain people had no idea that Audi was launching an A5 model until they saw mine on the road. First Audi..great coupe, quality & quick My first Audi and so far is excellent. Loaded A5 (all options except S-line package), ride is fantastic...great in corners, straight, smooth and very quiet on highways. Acceleration is very good and feels quick (better then my \\'05 Acura TL), especially in sport mode. Audi delivers amazing interiors with high quality. Backseat is okay for small kids, but almost unusable for adults. I\\'m a tall/big guy who fits very comfortably up front. Technology is great - imports entire Blackberry phone book in one shot with excellent Bluetooth connection.  MMI is not difficult to learn, but can be cumbersome. Voice activation not live on the A5.  Overall, great blend of luxury and sporty ride.  It\\'s an amazing ride With fuel prices the way they are, I just couldn\\'t see living with the low mileage of the 8 cyl, so I opted for the 6 cyl instead.  The dealer had an A5 with an Audi factory installed S5 option (cosmetic kit) so I have S-Line interior trim, upgraded 19\" wheels (that I like better than the \"S\") and claimed mileage up to 32 MPG (we\\'ll see - I do a lot of highway driving). Audi Gets It Right I\\'ve owned more than 18 cars over the past 23 years (mostly premium imports -- Audi, BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura), and the A5 is one of my favorites.  It\\'s an exceptional combination of style, performance, comfort and build quality.  No car can do everything perfectly, but this one does so many things extremely well.  I might even keep this car longer than a year or two.       Super Car for those in the know A5 is not for everyone. It\\'s for the experienced drivers to savor all the perks of driving very touchy and agile vehicle. Strong. Solid design in and out. One of the first owners of an A5 Audi is the only car that I would even consider driving through the countryside of England in the winter(!) period, especially with my children in tow. This company is doing everything right and has even surpassed BMW (I still own a Mini) in quality and comfort. Audi has won me over in consistency and an above average desire to please its new customers. These cars contain something the others have lost - character. Audi is the company that got me interested in automobiles which I never thought would happen. 2009 Audi A5 \"like new\" Overall it was great, my only problems are the scratches on the hood which are unrepairable. They need to be coated or repainted. I Got too excited not knowing those were not regular dirt. The license plate bracket was also damage, dealer did not disclose and did not replace with a new one. A5 me baby great car with minimal issues (all covered by warranty so far).  Certified used is the way to go - 100k mile warranty.  Impressed with the fuel economy - highway driving (a little faster than posted speeds - if you know what I mean) yeilds 30+ MPG.  The S-Line seats provide great support making long road trips easy.  The only down side is the back seats, but hey, I don\\'t sit back there anyway!  it\\'s a shame that Audi has stopped offering the 3.2L engine as a base power plant, they have also stopped offering the manual 6-speed transmission in A5.  Now if you want them you have to jump to a S5 - and an additional $15k.  Sticky tires in the summer and snow tires in the winter make the A5 just a fun car to drive.Car was sold in July 2016 - replaced with 2016 Audi S5 Audi a5 3.2L Burns a lot of OIL I have an Audi A5 and it was great until i hit about 35K miles and it started to burn a quarte of oil every 1,000 miles and sometimes i even get 1,400 miles. I am extremly suprised since i drive mostly freeway and do nto drive it very hard. My local dealer agreed with me that this was B.S. but Audi USA refuses to fix it so beware of thsi when lookinng to purchase this car and it is my understadnign that the 2.0Liter needs oil every 850 miles. 3 year update my 2009 Audi A5 3.2 manual has been just about flawless. smooth, sexy, quiet and enough performance to make me smile. Have the premium, technology, bang and olufson, side assist and ride select, so it is loaded. Averaging 23-25 mph wnter and summer imn all around driving, 28+ on a trip. Still getting gawked at as it is one of the most beautiful cars on the road.Only one warranty repair in 33,000 miles, a door sensor for keyless entry was replaced.By far the best overall car I\\'ve owned in my 67 years First 3 months with my 2009 A5 Initially I was looking at either BMWs or Lexus but very happy I found this 2009 A5. I wanted a car that looks nice, has great value and fun to drive. I get two to three compliments a week in my red A5. It has many features that are worth having like the B&O stereo (a must) and the blind- spot alert LEDs on each side-view mirror. The voice-prompt feature also works extremely well when changing the audio input and nav commands. The car handles very well and is quick, especially in the Sport mode. The doors open wide so easy to get in/out of the comfortable seats. The air- conditioning systems works very well and is quiet. The trunk and the sunroof are surprisingly large. 2009 A5 S-line Exceptional car.  Other than having to buy new tires at 17000 miles, I\\'ve had no complaints and a million complements.  Good performance, good gas mileage, great handling and outstanding looks.  Definitely not another BMW or G-car clone! The Ladies Love It I was stopped one day at a party by a woman who said, \"Are you the guy who has the A5 that was parked outside of the cleaners?\" The exterior styling is amazing. It\\'s a true head-turner. Nothing like it. I have the windows tinted and the rear badging removed (except the Audi circles) for a stealth look. It\\'s a bit over-priced though. For nearly fifty grand, you get cheap floor mats, only 260 HP, no push button start (that package is another $2,000) no auto folding mirrors, cheap \"leather\" and an engine that burns about a quart of oil every five thousand miles.  Notwithstanding, Audi hasn\\'t imported a lot of these so it won\\'t be like the A4 where you see one on every corner. A blast to drive. Another Great Audi This is my 4th Audi. I\\'ve had 3 A4s (2 wagons and 1 sedan), Lexus RX330 and a 545i as recent cars. The A5 blows them all away. the 3.2 easily competes w/ the 545 V8 and the driving performance is awesome. The system is WAY better than iDrive and the instruments are easy to use. It looks great, drives great and (as usual) is a completely reliable performance vehicle. Not a single issue.  Only drawback are the seats. Read a lot about the regular (non S-Line) seats before I bought and still went with the standard seats. Coming from the Lexus, I had a really hard time with back and hip pain in the Audi seats. Tough comparison from a Lexus SUV to a sports car, but wishing for better comfort. Happy A5 owner Have all the toys in this car, have driven 7000 miles to date. Owned many cars in my 50 years of driving and this is by far the best. Enough performance and great quiet and comfort. Very smooth in every way. Getting 25+ mpg with no problems to date. If I could build it myself I would trade the mmi for touch screen nav, make the manual a little tighter shifting, but overall the best ride my wife and I ever had!  The most fun I\\'ve had driving a car! I\\'ve had my 2009 A5 for two months now, and I continue to be delighted every time I take it out of my garage, I feel like a child with a new toy.  I\\'m pampered by the amenities such as the excellent back-up camera, the i- pod integration system, the crisp 6- speed shifter, and the amazingly comfortable seats.  I love the screen over the sunroof, which allows a little light but not enough to make me squint against the sun.  The exterior styling is quietly elegant - the daytime running lights are cooler than I can say, and I love the keyless entry which keeps me from digging in my purse for my keys.  I routinely get 33 mpg on the highway. Cost $54k, people think it cost $75k I held onto my 1998 A4 for 11 years, before getting the A5 S-Line 3.2 MT in early May. I was looking for something sportier, but with the same quattro like 4WD since I live in CT and I like the feel of quattro on a snow covered highway.  The A5 has been a dream. The looks and fit of the exterior is exceptional. The interior is remarkable for its price range.  The 265HP is completely sufficient to address the 98% of my driving. I got Drive Select and it feels like two different cars in one.  Best yet, so few of these on the road and people regularly proffer estimates of $75k.  You want a daily driver that satisfies a need for sport without spending a small fortune? This is it. Mind blasting! Pros: Led lights, B&O Sound System, Exterior, Interior, MPG, all wheel drive, Trunk space, Great resale value and MMI console.  Cons: Expensive, Navigation package is not that great when compared to other luxury brands and not much head room. Overall this is an AWESOME Coupe!!!  Scrumptious A5 Chose the  A5 for its beauty and refinement. No disappointments as it has exceeded our expectations. Our 2nd Audi as we need awd and like the quality furnishings. But this baby has smooooth power and delivering 25+ mpg so far. Chose select drive, tech package and nav and all works delightfully. The 6 sp manual works flawlessly with plenty of torque in every gear. A5-S LIne: Fun to Drive but Uncomfortable I am 6\\'5\" tall and need a car I can fit in.  Rented an Audi A5 in Italy in January 2009 and fit great so shopped for one back home in California. Test drove the A5 and loved it.  But liked  the S-Line meteor gray looks much better so bought that one.  Am loving it.  So much fun to drive and there is enough head room. Not much visibility behind, but with the rear video camera and warning sounds, and side mirror driver assist-really don\\'t need the visibility. Quiet ride, fun to drive, and I get many random compliments in parking lots. Only really bad thing is that I hate the lumbar on the sporty seats. Cannot get  a comfortable position. Big bump in my lower back. No other seat does this.  A5-  Neck Breaker !!!! After 3 months I still look back at it and smile, the lines are great, the LED lights are AWESOME!! Being 1 of 3 in my area an S5 nothing to say about that, but the other A5 has the basic, if u can spend the money get the upgrades 19\", B&O system and as I\\'m reading the reviews the standard leather isn\\'t good, I have the Milano and can\\'t complain. I will say seat positioning is hard to find, but i haven\\'t found a car that makes it easy! I also have the Dynamic Control. If u like to be aggressive sometimes it\\'s worth it, the car totally changes under you (Trans, Suspen, Handle) and I have to say, for the small HRS power I have knocked out some pretty beefed up cars when I hit that button. Horrible Sun Roof It\\'s fun, the roof needs to open, I mean really for that much money Audi could do much better. It barely tilts. I only have 200 miles on it and already am looking for something else... A lot of money but no great things... Dash is very clumsy in design, not very user friendly, and if you buy one don\\'t even thing of trying to adjust anything on the dash board you will wreck your new baby... I like going to work, now The body of this car is by far the best looking on the road today.  And Deep Sea Blue is the most beautiful color I\\x92ve seen.  In the shade it looks black, but in the sunlight it\\x92s a gorgeous three dimensional metallic shade of dark blue. I think the darker colors bring out the lines better than the lighter ones, but I\\x92ve read other reviews that say the opposite.  The conclusion: the car has awesome lines regardless of color. The MMI isn\\x92t as confusing as some reviews say; however, most actions are a two-step process. It\\x92s a little more work, but there are SO many options for comfort, information, entertainment, etc. If you\\x92re considering this car, go drive one, you\\x92ll love it.   Stunning & Solid After 8 months, I am still thrilled with the car. I have never owned a car that got so much attention from so many people.  It has enough power to make it fun to drive, and the Quattro all-wheel drive is fun to challenge in corners. Vegas5 For the money, one of the best cars I have owned. I have received so much interest from other drivers whether driving it or walking up and people stopping to inquire. Driving impression for such a heavy car is terrific and well balanced. The all wheel drive and 19 inch wheels no doubt compensate. One reviewer complained about the steering. I don\\'t see it. I have not heard rattle, squeak or shutter. The fit and build quality is tremendous. Plus, you\\'re not seeing yourself coming down the road in a 3 series. The v6 has great power. The V8 blows you away, but so does the gas. Great car.  Style, Performance, Comfort, Value       Shopped long and hard and considered BMW3 and Z4, Mercedes C300 and SLK, Infiniti G37, Cadillac CTS and Audi TT. In my opinion, the A5 offered the best combination of style,performance, comfort and value and I have not been disappointed after four months and 5000 miles. MPG of 20.3 with estimated 20% highway/80% city. Plenty of room for two sets of golf clubs in the spacious trunk. I enjoy the look of the 19\" Y wheels but would not recommend them to those of you that do the majority of your driving on the highway due to a rougher ride. Minor nitpicks for excessive brake dust (although it appears to be moderating) and for a slight roughness when shifting from second to third. BMW beater... in the winter at least Traded in 2000 BMW 328i. Had always planned on replacing with another BMW but I haven\\'t been impressed with the current designs and decided to make the switch. Looked at a number of cars in this segment but ultimately choose the A5 for the practicality of the AWD, decent MPG, and of course the stunning looks (don\\'t buy this car if you don\\'t like being gawked at). Acceleration and handling are good but there are certainly cars with better. Got to test out the Quattro last month in some serious snow and ice... and it was unbelievable. For me it was all about being able to drive in the winter. If that\\'s not an issue than I think the competition is stiff for the A5. Everything I hoped for, and more After drooling for this car for the better part of a year, I finally ordered the car last July.  Unfortunately, due to availability issues, I was unable to drive the configuration I ordered (18\" tires, M/T).  The car\\'s ride and handling easily surpassed my expectations (as well as my previous 2002 A4 w/ sport suspension.  Engine is silky smooth, with a light clutch but excellent feedback.  The car is extremely quiet, and combined with the Bang & Olfsen radio, just a pure joy to drive A5 - Nice, not flawless I finally traded in my 2001 BMW 330 for this car and although it is a nice car, I miss the BMW just a bit. The long wheelbase makes navigating in tight situations tough and the standard leather feels really cheap. Wish I would have paid for the leather upgrade. Also, wish it came standard with the S-line seats. The standard seats feel a little too flat and make it tough to really have fun with the car. Don\\'t get me wrong, this car is sweet. It is awesome to drive and the performance definitely rivals a BMW. Much cheaper than the 335 coupe too. Really like the technology controls and the B&O sound system rocks.  Tough to go wrong. Wish I had more money to buy the upgrades. So far so good 2009 A5 S line with all the bells and whistles. My 3rd Audi. Bought after my 1st Benz that I got ripped off from my G35 coupe trade in. Still breaking it though so I will get back after a few months for a full review. Didn\\'t do the drive mode button though...waste of money. Still trying to get used to seat position, haven\\'t found perfect yet. Shame it doesn\\'t have as much power as the G37 with the V6. I would have went with the lower powered turbo instead or diesel if an option here in the US. A5: A cult classic I own an A5 S-Line version in red. I love it after stepping down from a 1997 A8. The car was worth waiting for and it is really a large sport car. This thing handles like a dream, but if it didn\\'t have 19 in wheels with summer tires the ride wouldn\\'t feel so brutal over bad pavement. The combination velour and leather seats are firm and supportive, a good thing for spirited driving. These seats are not as cushy as the A8, but this is a different beast. I like the driving position so much that I have changed my position in other cars to replicate the position. The trunk is only 3 cubic feet less than the A8, this means it is huge (about 16 cubic ft). Trust me--Go manual This is the most fun car I have ever owned. My last car was a BMW 335 and the power and acceleration of the A5 is just as good.  I read some reviews saying this car lacked acceleration power, so I drove test drove both the manual and the automatic. The difference was night and day.  For anyone who wants a serious sports car with amazing handling, I would recommend the manual version of the A5- -while the automatic is nice, the manual drives and feels much more like the S5, but about 10K less expensive. I was considering the BMW X6, but the A5 was more fun to drive with much better gas mileage. Seriously, forget the tiptronic--only about $1200 more for auto, but a downgrade in my opinion. 2009 A5 The Ultimate Coupe Amazing value. I\\'ve owned a 911Cab, 535i, SL55AMG and CL500 in the past 5 years. Ridiculous yes but I like cars. None of these come close to my new loaded \\'09 A5 for the dollar. Yes, the SL55 had the power & torque but not the value or the back seat for kids. I also drove the S5 but glad I bought the A5 instead with drive select. Sometimes I want the 911 handling and other times the Lexus sofa. With DriveSelect, its your decsion and it all works! I predict MB, BMW and Lexus will lose market share to Audi over the next few years and rightfully so. \"Car of the Year\" ...if you can find one. A Big Step Up This has been a hectic journey. Ten months, and three different A5 orders, I got my Audi. I originally opted for a Deep Sea Blue A5, but I settled for Brilliant Black. All I can say is wow. At just about every stop-light, I will get stares are looks from other drivers.When I go to a restaurant, valet will park me in the front. When I get into my car with the intelligent key, I am relaxed by the Bang & Olufson sound system. In terms of safety, I don\\'t think you can get much better. Rear backup camera, tons of airbags, and sticky tires which prevent me from sliding. Overall, I do not regret going from a 2006 325xi to this car. I highly do not regret leaving the BMW Brand. I am happy I bought it. 2009 A5 got it right! I had a 2008 A5 on order, but fortunately I delayed the order so I could get a 2009. Worth the wait. I traded a RS6 and am far happier. Don\\'t feel like I gave up much performance (yes, I drove the S5 also) but the gained a 50% or better increase in mileage. Handling is the best of any Audi I\\'ve owned. Car is beautiful and I have gotten more compliments on the car than I had with the Porsche Carerra. The \\'09 has the Audi sensors on the side mirrors that show a warning light for traffic in your blind spot. There is on the fly control of steering, suspension, and shift characteristics from gentle to aggresive. iPod combined with B & O sound is fantastic with no distortion at full volume.   Blew out my ridiculous expectations! This car is simply amazing all around. Comes with a nice price tag, but definitely worth every last penny. Exterior styling and especially interior fit/finish are top notch. The performance for  V6 is quite good and the Quattro really makes you stick to the road. Its really nice not having to worry about the back- end getting away from you. I get so many looks in this car I\\'m afraid a few people haven\\'t wrecked looking at it because they stare so long. Overall, I give this car a solid 10, it is everything I thought it would be and more! Adults Only I had test drives in the G37, TT and A5 and had to think long and hard on what was a very difficult choice. The A5 finally won me over with its fabulous lines matched perfectly to a class leading interior and Audi build quality. I\\'m giving up a 2003 BMW 330ci which I really love for this car. I came to the conclusion that there comes a time in life when it\\'s not the fastest 0-60 time that matters. The A5 is responsive enough for me (although the D position is pretty woeful for spirited driving) in sport or manual shift mode. Driving home from the dealership (83 miles) with the A5 was a joy. Long distance cruising in this car is a pleasure. Sound insulation is excellent with 18\" wheels. First Audi and not disappointed This is my first coupe and my first Audi.  I picked up the car two weeks ago after waiting ten weeks from order to delivery. The car is absolutely beautiful inside and out, is fun to drive and very quite on the highway.  Audi really got it right with this design. Four year  Audi experience Had this car for four years and then moved up to an S5. The only thing lousy on it was the microphone for the telephone . I could hear people great but they could not hear me well due to too much road noise . This problem was solved in the new model by putting the microphone in the seatbelt. Best convertible Best convertible Quality Plus! Because this car is so more cost effective than a comparable BMW or Mercedes, both of which I\\'ve owned, I highly recommend it. The quality is evident and (with the 6 speed manual transmission) it\\'s a joy to drive. Handling is superb. I\\'m impressed so far I bought my Audi A5 two weeks ago. I also considered a BMW 135, but I live in Canada so AWD is important in the winter. I also wanted a spare tire just in case (BMWs have run flats). First impressions are excellent. We had our first major snow of the season yesterday and the Quattro is impressive. I tried it in an icy parking lot where hockey skates would have been a good idea and the Quattro was very effective. The engine note is not as sweet as the S5, but I went for the better fuel economy. So far, fuel economy is not what I was expecting, but perhaps the engine needs breaking in. Very unhappy with quality of Car 12 Months in and the car has been in the shop a dozen times.This time for 10 days.The car is a beauty.Drives well (Not a BMW). And is quattro.It has a a full trunk and the design is great.The reality is that the shifting is very suspect.It does not engage properly at slow speeds which is a safety issue when you accelerate.Audi says there is no issue.The bluetooth works when it wants to and the ipod hook up works when it wants to.I like the car but will never ever buy another Audi. Audi corporate is a nightmare and the build quality just is another nightmare.My service advisor is a good guy and we just laugh every time I call. after 4 months and 4100 miles I am extremly satisfied with Audi performance, look. I went back to dealer a few times after purchase and find it as courteous and frendly as they were on purchase day. very unhappy with quality and service Drove porsches for 9 years, just got my Audi this summer.Radio works when it wants to but of course service says nothing wrong since it was working when I brought it in.Worse, the leather in pass seat split.Service claims puncture with knife.Umm, no.Don\\'t think I ever stabbed my seat.Very dissatisfied. 45 days into the car A5 Coup This is my third Audi. I\\'ve been through 3 Lexus and 3 MB before I jumped into Audi. I must say up front I loved my 2007 A4 and thought with the kids out of the house it was time to drive a coup. I never had a single issue with my A4 Cabrio ( that I still own ) or my A4 sedan. The A5 has a bit of a different story. Right off the bat 3 defective tires. I kid you not and it took 4 days for Audi to approve their replacement. Besides this little hi-cup the car is a beauty. Feels great , great MPG and enough pep to run with the rest. Sporty steering wheel but if they tell you you can fit someone in the back seat forget it. I\\'ll love the car for the 3 years until the lease is up. Then back to A4.  a slug looks great, fun to drive when at speed. but it is a total slug when taking off from a stop. There is virtually no response to the accelerator, sometimes it even shutters. I felt safer merging into tight traffic in my 2002 turbo diesel beetle. Also, the doors are so heavy that, when you throw them open to exit, they always close on you. The dealer says that the acceleration is normal for the cvt transmission.  1st Month with A5 Cabrio This car is great.It drives as good as it looks.I got the car in the winter in the North East.It handles very well in snow.Can\\'t wait until spring when can put the top down...will feel like new car. So Far So Good I took delivery of the car two days ago and have enjoyed every minute in it.  I look forward to starting the engine every morning.  The car is VERY smooth, tightly assembled, well appointed, and really just a well built automobile.  We looked at BMW, Volvo, & Lexus.  The A5 won us over.  Fun to drive, looks great outside & in, car is full of features and even plenty of room for a 4 yr old.   Drop Dead Gorgeous Ride Third Audi that we have owned in the family (\\'99\\' A8, \\'97\" S8) This vehicle is quite different. I purchased it for my wife\\'s birthday. I am trying something completely new. I am giving her no opinion on the car, I am letting her do the grading and such. I give it all 10\\'s because I researched out for 6 months. And I know Audi\\'s. It sits on the fence between MB & BMW. It has the best of both of their worlds. Excellent vehicle.  Great Vehicle - Improved for \\'11 Ordered 5/2010 -- one of the first \\'11\\'s off the truck.  Traded an \\'07 A4 Cab for this one.  I\\'m very impressed with the quality and the additions made to the \\'11 vs the \\'10 (i.e. the Premium Plus package now includes an auto dimming mirror not available in \\'10, the radio presets now display the name and artist without having to go back to the main menu).  It\\'s larger, roomier and quieter than the A4.  I chose the Teak Brown with Cardamon interior -- new combination for \\'11 -- stunning!  Overall a great car although pricey @ $51k -- but still less than a BMW Cabriolet comparably equipped.  MPG equal to sticker estimates with under 100 miles! Two weeks owner The overall design and appearance of the vehicle is great! This vehicle is definitely easy on the eye... The braking going downhill is a little shaking but on the flag service it\\'s great. To have a 2 engine the accelerating is unexpected, unexpectedly great. Also the food fuel economy is an added bonus. I haven\\'t had the vehicle long enough to determine cost of Maintenance etc etc but for peace of mind I purchased an extended warranty Reliable sporty coupe that still looks great I\\'ve had my 2011 A5 s-line 2.0t for over 4 years now, and it has met or exceeded all expectations.  It did have an oil burning issue that is common to certain years of a4/a5/q5 with the 2.0t engine.  This was fixed under warranty without issue and the car hasn\\'t burnt a drop of oil since.  Only other unscheduled maintenance in 4 years was a pcv valve that recently went bad and started making a screeching noise ($350 iirc).  Overall at 73k miles now it has been very reliable, maybe moreso than expected, given my previous experience with owning vw/Audi, knock on wood.  The car is on its 3rd set of tires, and I have not replaced brake pads and rotors yet in the 4 years and 50k miles I have owned it. City driving will give 21-22 mpg, with 30+ on the freeway (I\\'ve gotten over 500 miles on a tank before).  The car is not fast but it is quick enough, and handles well.  The build quality is great, especially interior materials, with no significant rattles on what is almost a 6 year old car.  Rear seat space is good for a two door - I am 6\\'2 and have ridden back there comfortably on reasonably short trips.  Trunk is large for a coupe.  If I could change anything, it would be to have the sunroof open and not just tilt.  Bluetooth audio would also be nice, not just phone compatibility. I am still a huge fan of the a5\\'s styling and think it will look classic for years to come.  I plan to keep it for at least a few more years.  Overall I would highly recommend this car to a prospective buyer, just make sure it has has the piston ring/oil consumption repair done under warranty! 2011 Audi A5 is so so but fun Overall the performance is decent. Acceleration is fun but only when the transmission is in the sport mode but the Quattro handling is on point 100% of the time. The trunk size is better than in the 3 series coupe but rear seating room is minimal and don\\'t even try putting a rear facing car seat in if you\\'d like to have a front passenger. The front seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room is provided. As far as the layout of the entertainment system, it could have been better thought out because it is confusing but the sound quality is great. Another HUGE negative is that you cannot play music through Bluetooth unless you get the $89 tunetoair device on Amazin. Overall the car is fun, comfortable and reliable. Get a BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes or anything else! I can\\'t begin to say how much I regret my purchase. Shame on Audi for poor design, poor quality and essentially everything else besides styling. People will compliment the car all the time on the looks but thats all the car is good at. I drive a lot (20k per year) and I must say driving this car is miserable. On the commute in stop and go traffic the turbo lag and engagement is severe. The brakes are subpar and don\\'t give a confident feeling like BMW does. The interior is a surplus of plastic and feels cheap. The iPod cable is in the passenger glove box and is horrible to use an you will forget your phone every time should you plug it in. The Sounds system is good but the base rattles every plastic piece. Wind noise is high on the freeway and the seats are uncomfortable. After owning BMW, Lexus, Jaguar and cadillac this will be my last Audi for sure. Very disappointed and cannot wait to get rid of it!*Update - after owning the car 8 months I was lucky enough to get out of it and purchased a Cadillac Escalade. I could not be happier and am so glad to have the Audi gone. Sharp looking exterior but awful car overall. Glad to be rid of this car I bought mine new in 2011 and kept in nearly 4 years.  My car burned oil.  Audi settled a class action lawsuit because they used bad parts that cause this problem.  Getting warranty to deal with this or any other issue was always a pain in the rear.\\r The programming also was annoying.  Set your lights to auto and everytime to open the door with to grab the mail with the engine on you get a warning tone.  Radio presets always have to be selected instead of staying in memory.  Service light can only be turned off by audi not independent garages.  If the passenger unbuckles, I don\\'t need a tone every 60 seconds. \\r I traded for a BMW and am very happy I got out of this POS.   Perfect balance of style and luxury As a former MB owner, I gave them first chance. Test drove several models and was left with that empty feeling of not being 100% satified. Several of my buddies who are BMW junkies had suggested I gave 335Xi a looksee. Yes, a great upgrade from Mercedes but still something was missing. Oh, that\\'s right the car looked blah outside.So, my 3rd choice was the A5. Somewhat smaller than 335xi, I am not a big guy, the car felt a little tight but with a miriad of seating positions I was able to find one that was perfect for me. The car looks and drives like a dream. It has enough power for me to drive fast from standstill, I love the cockpit and the way it is laid out.This one is a keeper. Pretty But With Issues People will go out of their way to tell you how much they like the looks, but the car has issues and I sold mine after 10 months for a pretty steep write down.Issues:The 2.0 lags off the lineThe doors are incredibly heavy and passenger door lacks a gripable handleMileage with 4 cylinders is only 25 MPGAC and heat loud and not effectiveConsole box is too smallStock tires have no traction on wet roadCar very hard to dry after washing, water drips from the mirror and back license frameVery low position, hard to see front - I popped 3 tires in 10 monthsCabin noise pretty high on highway. I\\'m in love Packages:Premium Plus, Sport Package, MMI Nav, B&O sound systemThis is my 2nd Audi (1998 A4).Audi has hands down the best interior ergonomics and it continues with this car.I was disappointed that the new VW has a touchscreen, but the higher end Audi, doesn\\'t, however given the layout, a touchscreen would be awkward and inconvenient.The MMI controls are laid out perfectly to where I can push buttons, shift and focus on the road all at once.Exterior design is a head-turner which blows away the 2011 335xi (I don\\'t really consider MB or Lexus competitors if you go with a 6sp manual tranny).Less HP/Torque than a BMW, but also considerably less $$ than a 335xi. Great car and 36+MPG! I have had this car for 7 months and think it is the perfect balance of practicality and performance.The 2.0T engine is fast but not even close to the S5.I use this car as a daily driver and often commute 4o miles each way to work.A great surprise with this car is the fuel economy.I got an average of 36.5MPG coming home from work yesterday (mostly highway).The stated MPG on this car MUCH less than what you get in real world driving.I am surprised that there isn\\'t more press about this? Car has it all Well first of all, it\\'s drop-dead gorgeous. Amazing Deep Sea Blue paint, although I personally think the curves show up better with the lighter colors. Seats are comfortable, but still could us more lateral support. 8 speed auto with the 2.0T is super-smooth, and sneaky fast, (although it\\'s no M3-beater). But so what! It\\'s a hoot to drive, comfortable without being cushy, and it gets a few more mpg than the 3.2 I\\'d been driving. Was concerned about a going to a 4 cylinder, but this engine is really special. A major improvement over the \\'08 2.0T that I didn\\'t even consider. Can\\'t wait to get it on a twisty back road!  Excellent Value! Have been driving my A5 for 5 months now and I still love it.It has decent engine power, although I would not classify it as sports car class.The handling on the other handling is excellent and extremely confident in the corners at speed.My car get 34mpg on the highway as well!I don\\'t think there is a car on the road that is this efficient, fun to drive, and great looking.If you are looking for real sports car acceleration go for the S5. Worth the wait It took almost five months to receive the car, but I took delivery last Friday.I was apprehensive about the 4 cyl engine, but now 200 miles in I love it.It is smooth and yet has enough power for a driver who is not looking to set speed records.There is a slight turbo lag, but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit.The engine sound isn\\'t brawny, but I just turn the music up so I can\\'t hear it anyway!The design, both exterior and interior, is immaculate.It is truly a joy to drive, and even my eight year old son keeps running into the garage to sneak peeks in it.I also feel the Prestige package is worth it for the smart key alone. Worth It Wow! I wanted a nice refined coupe to transition to from my \\'97 4Runner as my daily driver to ease my commute, and I am over the moon with this car. Initially I had some worries about Audi\\'s spotty quality record, but the past 2.5 months have been reassuring. The 2.OT has more than enough pep for me right now, the interior is museum- quality, and the exterior design is drool-inducing. 99.9% of the amenities are well thought out and well implemented. Fuel economy with premium fuel is a bit less than I hoped (22mpg mixed, but as high as 29 on a clear hwy); given everything else this car has, I have had NO twinges of buyer\\'s remorse. I look forward to another 15+ years with this car. A Head Turner Without Question A tried and true BMW owner for the last 8 years, I decided to look at other options after I found the BMW dealers in my area arrogant and overpriced. I researched a number of Audi models including S4, A5 and S5. Being a cabriolet and performance fan, I was intrigued by the S5 Cab.  Audi\\'s do not have a hardtop, so I was immediately turned off and then considered the coupe instead, as noise was a factor. I eventually settled on the A5 coupe with a premium package. Aside from the S package, this is the only upgrade you can get in Canada. However, this car is a pleasure to drive, it has more power than I thought, and is beautifully appointed both from a technology and aestetics perspective.  The Car Everyone Wants - Literally Has to be one of the most spirited 4-cylinder cars on the road.  It prefers to drive fast with lots of torque to bring in the turbocharger.  However, when driving residential it is a bit sluggish off the line. It feels like it starts in 3rd to save gas.  If you have the Sport package, you can put it in tiptronic mode and shift the gears, which gives it more pick up. Loving the Prestige Package I\\'ve driven this car over 900 miles in three days, and it\\'s great. I have gotten hundreds of compliments on it and enjoy driving it. The gears are very close together, the system recommends that the car be in sixth gear at 50 mph.  Not a lot of compartment storage in the front for miscellaneous items. I ordered the light gray interior from the factory, but it looks beige.  I should have gone with black. A4 died early Engine needed pistons and rings at 100k miles, cost almost as much as it was valued. Excellent car I\\'ve had my 2012 Avant for 2 years and 27,000 miles and I\\'ve experienced no problems so far (knock on wood). It\\'s comfortable on long hauls and I don\\'t get the back aches that I used to. This is odd, because I don\\'t feel like the seats are as comfortable when you first sit in them, but yet, somehow they work well even after 4+ hour drives. It\\'s fairly sporty and has punch when you need it. Very well planted in the rain, lending confidence in adverse conditions. Buttery smooth transmission 97% of the time, but it doesn\\'t like slow stop and go traffic. Putting it in sport for those times stops the lurching.  A4 Disappointment at approximately 1000 miles on the odometer of my 2012 Audi A4 Avant Quattro, a strange noise began from the front area of the engine. The noise happens at the first startup of the engine regardless of ambient temperature. After about 2 minutes when the engine idles down the noise stops. Different Audi technicians at two dealerships have diagnosed the noise as 1) cam tensioners, 2) a bad bearing inside the cam case, 3) secondary blower motor and, 4) lash in the VVT system. None of the technicians have put a wrench on any of the named components because, according to the dealerships\\' service managers, Audi USA will not authorize repairs. According to Audi USA, the strange noise is a normal fu Cannot duplicate Purchased Nov 8, 2011. Odometer now shows 4015 miles (as of Feb 10, 2012 when it was towed to dealer). Beginning at about 1000 miles, engine made serious noise when first started in the mornings. To an untrained ear, it sounds like a bad bearing noise emanating from something at the front of the engine. Car has been to dealer service twice for a cumulative 9 days. Techs and Service Advisor have listened to audio recordings of the noise, but report that they cannot duplicate the problem; hence, they cannot fix the problem. I found several YouTube postings by A4 owners with the same problem. Dealer says, \"it\\'s normal,\" yet, it did not make the noise for the first 1000 miles. Premium with NAV Have wanted a sport wagon for quite some time.Finally got around to it and found out thatBMW 5 series Wagon, Audi A6 Avant and Passat Wagon are no longer being made.The Subaru is too SUV like, the BMW 3 series too small and the Passat Wagon not up to snuff.That left the Audi A4 Avant and the Acura TSX wagon.Was not an easy choice given the $8K to $10K price difference, but I like the look, drive, power and rear seat accessibility much better on the Avant.Only have 1,000 mile on it, but love driving it.Also, it\\'s pretty limited and will not be made after this year, so is not something you see every day.Am very happy with the Avant and really glad I bought it.  Transmission problem on new car Car just has 400 miles on it, and first time I found the problem with the trasmission when stuck in traffic. I feel a strong bump when remove a foot from brake and push a gaz pedal. I took it to a local Audi dealer in Norwell. They said that this is a characteristic of a new 2012 A4 transmission and that this is how this new transmission was design, which sounds like BS. Supposed to take it back to Bernardi Audi, where I got it from to see what they can found. Otherwize it runs OK. Manufacturer defect and no support for 2012 A4 Audi recently settled a big lawsuit for owners of 2009-2011 A4\\'s that had oil consumption problems. The 2012\\'s were not included in that lawsuit, and now that our car is out of warranty we are out of luck for getting their assistance with repair costs. It was first taken in for oil consumption problems when it was only 3 years old, and we paid for that service. Now that it is 2-3 years later the problem has returned and we are looking at either a $6,000 repair for pistons/rings or a $12-$15k replacement engine. We\\'ve paid off this vehicle, but it did not have an extended warranty. We use it for work and do a lot of highway miles, so it does have more than 100k miles. We\\'ve also had oil changes done at places other than an Audi dealership. All of those things worked against us. We have spent so much time and money on this issue, and on the care overall, that I would not recommend a 2012 A4 to anyone looking to purchase a used vehicle. dynamics = great, everything else = meh/poor We leased 2 of them.  We loved our first one (a 2010), although it had an oil problem and the rearview mirror kept on falling off.  The second one was a nightmare.  The car shipped with a torn front seat.  The first one had 60/40 folding rear seats.  The second one didn\\'t.  The guy screwed up our order, but by the time we realised this, it was too late.  Also the fuel economy for each car SUCKED!!!!  Every 2 weeks we paid $60+ for hi-grade petrol (for comparison, our 2015 328xi costs around $35 to fill for the same duration).  The ergonomics were a mess.  The backseat was the size of the backseat of a coupe (i.e. nonexistent).  Caveat Emptor! I love this car It is a nice car, it is not a performance car.  I went from a Hemi Challenger with 380 horsepower to this so I might be biased or off on my judgment a little but it is quick and fast but not great acceleration.  the automatic seems to hesitate when I step on the gas.  I like to use the auto/manual shift but worry I might be putting too much wear and tear on the tranny.   It handles great.  I can go on \"on ramps\" and \"off ramps\" at about 80 and no tire squeal.  It is fun to drive.  I live the leather seats are comfortable and classy.  I am thinking of getting a performance mod on the ECU.  I bought this used with about 30k on it.  great used car for $20K.Now I have about 65K miles and the car is still great.  I haven\\'t had any trouble with it at all.  Just a great car to drive Love my A4, great value This car is a great value. I bought it certified pre owned which I don\\'t regret at all. Wonderful warranty come with it, maintenance included for some mileage intervals. The ride on this car is the best of any car I have had, I couldn\\'t imagine a smoother ride at this price point! I like the navigation screen and map, but the screen could be bigger. Infiniti Q50 has the perfect screen size, get the queue from them! Trunk is huge, I love the way the trunk pops open when you hit the switch or button, if you have your hands full it\\'s wonderful. There are hooks in the trunk ceiling for shopping bags so they don\\'t fly around (genius!), both back seats fold down. The Bang & Olufsen stereo is top notch, clear and awesome sound, better than the Bose with Infiniti. I don\\'t like that the car doesn\\'t connect Bluetooth for music on your phone, that is such an easy add for a car company, the connector for the phone to play music is in the glovebox, very odd, and you can\\'t have both that and the headphone connector in the armrest for music. Audi, fix this! I do like the CVT transmission, very smooth ride but it seems to have play in it when taking off sometimes, they can\\'t find anything wrong but it\\'s something to get used to, if they even make this trans anymore. I LOVE the led running lights, has to be my favorite feature! Looks awesome driving, and it\\'s the last year with the individual dot lights before they made the continuous line light, just my preference. The gas mileage is amazing, I get almost 30 mpg with almost all city driving. Freeway driving takes it over 30. With the turbo you can\\'t tell you are driving a 4 cylinder, I can\\'t stress how I hated a 4 cylinder before, but with this car I love itPros: gas mileage, smooth ride, solid feel, very stylish, big trunkCons: no Bluetooth music feature, small navigation screen Struck the (almost) perfect balance I got this car as a stylish daily commuter that would also serve my need for winter drives to Tahoe and dinner with clients. Since I drive 90 miles round trip each day I wanted a car that was comfortable, fuel-efficient and stylish. I\\'m very pleased with the overall interior and exterior design which after looking at the usual suspects I think are clearly best in class.The car has also exceeded my expectations for gas mileage as I\\'ve been experiencing low to mid-thirties on the highway. I\\'ve been impressed with the important creature comforts during my drives including the seats, adjustable armrest and climate control. Love this car Handling, ride, comfort, and noise level are all fantastic.I average about 30 mpg and I drive pretty aggressively.Build quality is excellent.I have a manual transmission with sport pkg, heated seats, bi-xenon headlights and the upgraded sound system and paid $35K.The stereo is fantastic too. The only problem I\\'ve had was the alignment getting out of whack for some reason, but the dealer corrected it and I haven\\'t had any other maintenance issues to report. Think twice.... So after 1.5 years of ownership and 24k miles later I think I can firmly give a sound review. I have an 12 A4 Premium Quattro with convience pk and heated seats. I paid 35K plus taxes. Now for 35k you would expect a basic trip computer....no...xenon headlamps...no. Memory seats...no. These are options that are standard on a TSX. The ride quality is decent, on the highway is where you will feel most comfortable. The city is ok...it just feels sloppy to me. The interior is really nice and comfortable. The MMI is a pain in the ass to use. There is no logic to it in my head. I am not sure what the heck people are talking about in having great gas mileage..I barely get 300 with mix city highway Poor transmission on the front track model The cvt transmission is a nightmare on the front track model. At a stop, it takes a second for the car to take off when you press the gas.This can be a safety issue.I got rid of A4 Front track after two month of frustration and got a quattro instead. This bad choice cost me quite a bit of money.Fortunately, the quattro is a great car. This car burns oil \"My car has been burning 1 quart of oil every 2500 miles. The dealer \"fixed\" it, but it still burns 1 quart every 3000 miles. Both the dealer and Audi told me that 1 quart every 1200 mile is within specs.\" So far, so good. I decided to take a chance on a German vehicle with reservations about reliability.I\\'ve put 4k miles on the car so far with no issues.Very happy with all aspects of the car.Handles well, gets good mileage (right at 25 overall) and is very comfortable.I have the sport package and was concerned that the ride might be punishing, however it is just firm and still very comfortable.The dealer experience has been excellent.I\\'ve had no issues with it burning excessive oil as some others have had.Hopefully the positive trend will continue. Overpriced and sparse The car is nimble with excellent acceleration and tight steering.But the cabin is bare enough to remind one of Mother Hubbard\\'s Cupboard.Everything that is standard on a Kia is an extra here.For a $35,000 car you do not even get a self dimming rearview mirror.The MMI is clunky and anti intuitive.The stereo system is bare bones.Milage is about 17 city and 25 higway. 2012 Audi A4 Premium Plus Bought a new 2012 A4 in November.I was shocked that a $40,880 vehicle does not support Bluetooth Audio streaming when a budget car like the Ford Fiesta does!The rear headrests are so large that they block 20% of the rear windshield.The Bluetooth voice command requires a separate phonebook that requires user entryThe steering feels artificial and loose and lacks good road feel.My highway gas mileage has been 24 MPG but the spec said 29 MPG.I have been very gentle with the accelerator (less than 2000 rpm) and only drive highway so this is far lower than I expected.I get 30 MPG in my Accord when the spec says 29.The instantaneous MPG on the trip computer says 200 MPG sometime Unreliable Disaster Read the reliability reports.Everything in there and more has gone wrong with my Audi.The sludge problems w/ the 1.8T, in my opinion, are the engineering equivalent of a surgeon leaving a scalpel inside you. Love Hate Relationship I bought this car new in 2001 - has the sport package, put in chip, it drives fantastic when it is not being towed to the mechanic.  I have 4\"thick file of repairs and tire changes.  It chews up tires every 20k miles regardless of brand and consistent tire rotation.  At 90k miles the engine blew.  Fortunately Audi replaced it after I provided documentation of oil changes every 5k miles. I have replaced wheel bearings, tie rods, timing belt, hoses, sensors, the turbo at 160k, battery, alternator etc. If it wasn\\'t paid for and if I did not love to drive it so much it would be gone. I cant find another car with the same combo of performance, mileage, utility,AWD, and class. 2001 1.8T A4 Quattro Wagon w/Sport Pack First few years car ran smoothly and was a lot of fun to drive except rear wheel bearings needed to be replaced twice by dealership - luckily still under warranty. Rims allowed snow/slush to build up which made car shake when driven in winter.  When 2-3 years old, rattling sound was heard.  Brought car in several times and was not given diagnosis.  After 75,000 miles (no longer under warranty), dealership was magically able to diagnose the problem: needs a new cam adjuster (dealership claims no prior awareness of problem)  Car has 100,000 miles and has had all four wheel bearings (and ball joint) replaced again by local mechanic. It is no better than tupperware - disposable after 3-year-use! Money pit Bought the car new off the showroom floor at end of \\'01 model year. Overall, the car handles beautifully (steering is drum tight!) and the cabin is well laid out and extremely comfortable for the driver and front passenger - which is particularly nice on long trips. Back seat is cramped, but wagon has been very useful. But beware... stuff will go wrong with this car. Every other month something else is going - and many items went just days beyond expiration of the warranty coverage! Major oil leak @ 52k. Another leak @ 65k. Seat frames. Steering rack. Front tie rods. Bose speaker. Headlamp washer. You get the idea. Great driving experience, but be ready to pay and pay and pay! Fun to drive and practical This is one of the rare fun to drive and practical cars out there. The extra cargo capacity comes in handy when it\\'s time to go to the mountain with the kids... Fun car to drive! This is a very comfortable and fun car \\rto drive. I like the feeling of \\rcontrol when driving the car, thanks \\rto the Quattro transmission.\\r I\\'ve had only one minor problem with \\rit. An aligment wheel which got \\rcovered by the waranty. \\r The sad thing with these luxury cars \\ris the depreaction which is pretty \\rsteep. \\r My only regret with this car is its \\rlack of power (1.8T engine). It \\rsometimes feel underpowered. My next \\rcar will also be an A4, but this time \\rwith the bigger engine V6 or even the \\rS4 if I can afford it. A4 Avant - Amazing car! Though a wagon, never feels like one. \\rHandles like a dream. Puts a smile on \\rthe face of anyone who gets behind the \\rwheel. Solid, jaunty, nervy car, \\rhandles on the curves like no other car \\ron the road. You feel safe driving this \\rthing and you are. Plus, if you\\'re \\rnaughty and crank it up past 100, \\ryou\\'ll see what it\\'s all about: \\rshakeless, silent splendor! Fantastic wagon This is the best car I have ever  Great car for active lifestyles! I\\'ve had this car for close to 2 years \\rnow... and the only problem has been a \\rpair of squeeky windshield wipers.  The \\rcar handles wonderfully... my quattro \\rwagon handles better than my buddy\\'s \\rBMW 330ci.  It\\'s fun to drive and great \\rfor trips with friends and all our \\rgear.  The car gets lousy gas \\rmileage... I get about 13 mpg in the \\rcity!  Well, what can I expect? I live \\rin San Francisco and I drive up many \\rsteep hills in a relatively heavy car \\rwith all wheel drive!  However, I can \\rdrive from San Francisco down to LA on \\rone tank of gas!  Overall, a great \\rcar! Stay Away from Audi By 5000 miles enginge coils failed one  2001 Audi Wagon 1.8 I had wanted an Audi wagon for awhile.  \\rI did a lot of research on the car.  I \\rdid finally end up purchasing one and \\roverall, I have enjoyed driving it.\\r Some issues that I have sadly \\rencountered are:\\r I had to have a new transmission after \\rowning it for 1 month!\\r The sunroof has an awful vibration \\runless the two back windows are rolled \\rdown some.\\r If you purchase the sport package as I \\rdid, the tires create a lot of wind \\rnoise! not so overwhelmed I think part of the problem is that i had built \\rthis car up in my head during the 4 month \\rperiod i was waiting to receive delivery of it.\\rthe 1.8t, although peppy required a chip to \\rsatisfy me. my older vr6 put a much bigger \\rgrin on my face. other than that. the car has \\rreally loosed up quite a bit. which is very \\rdisappointing for a $32,000 car with all the \\rtricks and german engineering. Sport Wagon ! A wagon that has satified my desire for \\ra sports car.  With the sports \\rsuspension it handles our curvy/hilly \\rcountry roads with a remarkably flat \\rroad hugging ride.  Yet it is still a \\rpracticle car, 4 people ride \\rcomfortably (a fifty not so \\rcomfortable). Has flexible cargo \\rcapacity. Maintain it and it will run excellent I purchased a 2001 1.8 avant from the original owner who maintained it very well. I have all the prior service records and I keep mine. As long as you maintain this vehicle it will run very well or you. If you want to abuse it then buy a toyota or some other tin can like vehicle. Yes a sube wrx is faster but the doors clink when you shut them as they are no where need as solid as an audi. I have owed several subes and 2 audis an A6 and this A4 (116,00 and counting). I have had maintenance that I have had to take to the shop and some I do myself.Sube copied the awd system.Those who provide poor reviews did not maintain their vehicle properly.  Great car!! I bought this car in November of last year and have had it for about six months, other than routine maintenance and fixing the simple stuff it runs great and gets great mileage. Every time i read these reviews i get angry because people complain about how much it cost to do simple repairs on the car and hows theirs engine sludge, One do routine oil changes like you should and you would not have this problem, two if the problem is a simple fix Do It Yourself the car is surprisingly easy to work on for a audi turbo charged vehicle, never take the car to audi to get it fixed they will make you pay a arm and a leg. and lastly my car has 180000 miles on it and runs like new.  Reliability isn\\'t bad, but could be better I bought my 2001 Audi A4 1.8T in November of 2010 & it\\'s now March 2012, so 15 months (almost a year & a half).Keep in mind this car was 10 years old when I bought it...4 months into owning it I need a new flex pipe: $250 parts and laborAt 12 months I needed to change some hoses: $50, change the boost value for the turbo: $150 and fix a leak in the brake assembly: $50 for a total of: $250 parts & labor.At 15 months (today) I needed to fix the turn signal relay: $50 and do 1 of my rear bearings: $300.Total: $350 parts & laborSo I\\'ve $850 in repairs.Excluding regular maintenance items, ie I\\'ve changed the brake pads, windshield wiper, tires and the oil changes. extremely solid car I have owned this car for a decade and mine currently has over 200,000 km.It is without question the best car that I have owned in my 30+ years of car ownership.During the last ten years I have owned similar cars including several newer A4\\'s and a comparable BMW but I could not part with this version of the A4 because of its overall fun and reliability in all weather conditions (the BMW is not near as capable in the snow).The AWD coupled with the sport suspension creates the best handling car that I have owned or driven.It is as solid as a German tank and I often tease that I could conquer France in this vehicle...and I anticipate putting ANOTHER 200,000 km on it.Mon Dieu!  2001 A4 1.8T i am the second owner of this car and it has been well taken care of before i got it and it continues to get the same care. i strongly feel that before consider purchase you check with insurance and maintenance. keep up with those and you will be fine. shop around on forums or dealerships and they will not charge as much. i love the things it offers and has a strong rocket engine with a stage 2 and better gas mileage.  Solid Car but Know it well Purchased the car with 118,000 km,knew it needed a few things when I got it but was excited to get such a nice solid car.Have replaced everything on the entire vehicle within a year ($25,000)mostly replacing with performance parts but only when needed. The car always pulled strong in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, little weak in 4th and 5th with stock turbo, but throw in a k04 and a tune and it really gets interesting. Fuel economy will surprise you, rip hard on it and a tank (60l) will be gone in 300 km, but cruise on the highway and expect close to 850-900. Small electrical things pop up but online there are many helpful resources to troubleshoot. Its a maintenance intensive car but with care reliable Great while it lasted I purchased this car used, and had it for 7 months (15,000 miles) before it was totaled in an accident. The car was a lot of fun to drive, and I\\x92m definitely going to miss it. It handled pretty, and had good acceleration. The fuel mileage was much better than I expected it to be. It was very comfortable on both short, and long drives. The trunk had plenty of room for luggage, and hauling. Like any used car it had some issues including a new MAF sensor, and a rear wheel bearing needing to be replaced in the first two months of ownership. Once those issues were sorted out the car was great. I\\x92m leaning towards a newer A4 to replace this one. So expensive to maintain I inherited this car from my parents, otherwise I would never have chosen a luxury sort of car.  In the two years I\\'ve had the car, I have put over $3000 in repairs.  Every time a light comes on, my heart sinks because it will be $1000 to make it turn off.  Today I learned that to replace the climate control panel will cost $850 plus labor.  what! As soon as it is out of the shop this time I will sell it before another light turns on.   Nice ride, when it\\'s not in the shop... The A4 is a nice balance between a sport sedan, family sedan, and luxury sedan.  PERFORMANCE: You won\\'t blow anybody\\'s doors off, but its 190 HP and 210 ft-lb of torque are enough to put a grin on your face from time to time. With the AWD, it handles great in all kinds of weather, fair or foul. The ESP is a bit overactive, however, and cuts in on even the slightest hint of any wheelspin. Fortunately, it can be disabled with the push of a button.  INTERIOR: The interior is very comfortable and well laid out, and it\\'s loaded with convenience features. There isn\\'t much room for adults in the rear, but it\\'s OK for kids. The trunk is very large and easy to access. The pass-through is handy also. Loved it--but too many problems Traded my mom an IS300 for it in 9/04 w/ 24k. I just sold it w/ 97k on it. Steering feel & accuracy was great, superb handling & brakes, great road feel & heavy weight. I had a manual trans and sport pkg so it was a blast to drive. Felt expensive & used great materials/assembly. But always in the shop, I had 21 repairs in the 4.5 years I drove it & it needed another 3 repairs (2 of which I previously replaced). Every year the ignition coils needed to be replaced & the engine \"sludged\" up (repaired under warranty). Lots of road noise and wind rush. Lots of features and thoughtful touches throughout. Great MPG. Uber expensive to fix and maintain (and I\\'m not cheap either).  A perfect blend of sport and luxury I have owned my A4 for seven-plus years.  Like any German car, service isn\\'t inexpensive, but the key is keeping up with regular maintenance.  My car just hit 100k miles and it still makes me smile when I turn the key.  No major issues.  Lots of fun to drive.  The quattro AWD system is a dream in snow.  I have owned three Audis (2000 A6 Avant; 1997 Cabriolet; this A4) and I loved them all. Love Audis, but not this Audi I bought my Audi used from a reliable used foreign car dealer. Love the power and handling, and it looks good. Two of my biggest problems that I have come across is the terrible fuel economy and the lack of heat. I\\'m getting about 18 mpg now, and that is mostly hwg. My heat blows cold air constantly. I recently spent $650 to get it fixed, just for the mechanic to tell me it still doesn\\'t work. But all in all, I would buy another Audi, they\\'re lots of fun.   87k miles I bought my A4 at 51k miles and have had it about a year and a half very fun car to drive love the AWD and the turbo is nice to have. So far I have taken the car to the shop 4 times and have had the camshaft ajuster, new coils, O2 sensors, fan clutch, oil leaks, mass air flow sensor, the tires seem to wear down fast, fuel filter, still waiting for audi to fix my timming belt that they do for free at 105k and should pay for damages if brakes before that. engine idiles loud and for a  min or two (I always let the engine warm up a min before driving as all turbo engines should) and a turbo timer wouldn\\'t hurt either. Luckly I had it covered by warranty which paid for most repairs.    Very disappointed I bought this car new. Maintained it to spec. Have had repeated problems including the radio failed; temperature sensor failed twice; LED display is failing; outside temp sensor is flaky. Today my dealer told me to service a zillion more things and quoted the repair bill at $4900! No way! This for a 7 year old car with about 64,000 miles. Get real. I\\'m never buying an Audi every again. (They even design it badly for maintenance ... it\\'s a nightmare to service ... so the labor charges add up quickly.)  In contrast, my Acura never needed anything special ... it\\'s back to the Japanese in a few months for me.  Great Car! I get about 25 mpg altogether, which isn\\'t bad. I love the feeling of acceleration you get when you step on it in second or third, as well as the nice whistling whoosh from the engine at about 3,000 rpm.Seats are comfortable, climate control is superb, and despite many other Audi owners, I have had no problems with this car, aside from a bent rim and an intake leak.  Luck of the Draw Bought \"used certified\" with 30K miles which may explain why it\\'s been farily reliable (86K now), though we did bring it back a few times while under warranty.  If you\\'re looking for a truly long term reliable car, skip this one. However, I don\\'t regret (yet) the purchase because the value was great. We bought this car for less than a new Mazda3. And driving a sport luxury car rather than an econo-box was a choice I can live with every day. I dont know why I like Audis, I just do I bought my 2001 Audi 2.8 almost 1 year ago. It has been a great car. I took it in today because the check engine light came on (becuase the gas cap wasn\\'t screwed back on correctly) Ahhh! Oil changes are about $85 which is a lot, but it\\'s good for 6k miles. Everyone thinks I\\'m crazy for paying that much for an oil change, but that\\'s how it is. I love having a powerful car. Brakes work great! Almost too well. All my friends love driving my car, it\\'s fun!  A rebadged VW w/ nothing to offer I purchased this car a few months ago due to my new job where I needed to drive daily, since prior to this I\\'ve had 2 sports cars (350z, mr2 turbo). I needed something comfortable with that didn\\'t look old and was cheap. I\\'ve always love the red color scheme of Audi interiors so I picked up this car. To be honest if you\\'re looking to buy an A4, save yourself the money and go buy a VW jetta/passat. Aside from the quattro there really isn\\'t much of a difference between them, the cars options are all kind of crappy, and this car is not as luxurious as my old Lexus ES, and definitely wasn\\'t as fun as my 350z, plus it\\'s horribly unreliable, and the little problems that come up tear away at you. It\\'s no Honda or Toyota Bought the car with 56k miles on it with warranty. I knew what I was getting myself into. But it was totally worth it! When the time comes it will be hard to let go.  Warranty more than paid for itself. Keep critical elements maintained and the car drives itself. Namely timing belt/tensioner and oil changes. I don\\'t have much sympathy for those who buy a German car and then are shocked when all they do is change the oil every 10k miles and expect nothing to go wrong. Go buy a Honda or Toyota and have fun driving around in your tin can!  It\\'s a driver\\'s car, therefore it does deserve some much needed attention.  Be ready to replace control arms, ignition coils, wheel bearings, t-belt. I love my A4 but will never buy again I bought this car as I am a german car lover. Unfortunately ever since I owned it I have had to change timing belt, tensioner, h2o pump, o2 sensor, 2 window regulators crushed, front door speaker bursted, 1 ball joint, 1 cv joint, name it. I hope by mid 2008 I will be able to trade it!! That is a pill hard to swallow. 2001 A4 Avant  I bought this car certified used which I would recommend. What a great peppy car! Fantastic handling on curvy mountain roads, as expected. Having turbo makes driving even more fun. Extremely reliable. Approaching 100K miles and it still drives like new. My only real complaint: for an all-weather, all-wheel-drive car it could be a little tougher. It\\'s a bit dainty. A great commuter car that lets you cart groceries, kids and pets without the size of a normal wagon. Never again I bought this car when it was 3 year old and had 51000 miles on it. After 6 months it started to break: ABS module, power window mechanism in 3 doors, leaking oil in engine (repair costs over $1000) oxygen sensor (another $1200, big problem to find right sensor), rear tail light, glovebox shaking all the time, even the horn didn\\'t work, engine light was on all the time. Car is very nice, handling and performance is great, but buy it on your own risk. Keeps breaking every two months This is my first car. When I bought it I was amazed with this it, very fast, fun to drive and very reliable. I bought it with 45k miles on it. Everything was great until the computer started giving me those annoying messages \"SERVICE REQUIRED\". Well, I decided to take the car to the dealership every time I got it and so far, I have paid in service and repairs around $2500 in two years! The lower lights have burned three times now, the left suspension arm broke, the battery died, the flow meter died, the sparks needed to be changed, the center console leds are broken, the horn broke and now, I have a water leak in the passenger footwell (this is caused by an aircon broken tube). Love my Audi! I have had my A4 for six years, and I still love it to this day. It is so fun to drive due to both handling and the turbo gives it an extra boost. The Quattro is a dream to drive in the snow, out performing many SUVs. The gas mileage is great! My only problems were back in 2004-05 when I had to replace the rear wheel bearings and the tie rods. Currently, when my car sits in the heat, the car beeps as if the driver side door is open, when in fact it is shut. Also, the speakers are busted. If my family wasn\\'t growing, I\\'d definitely buy another A4. Timing belt broken at 68k miles Nice car. European, handsome, drives nicely, especially the manual. Feels safe. Timing belt broken at merely 68k miles. It caused engine damage and I am out $6,000 now. And I drive my car very very nicely without hurting it. The manual says change the belt at 100k+ miles!! Talk about reliability. 50k Summary Well, it\\'s 50k later and this car is still so fun to drive. (I highly recommend the sport package for improved handling and low-to-the-ground stance.) With routine oil changes and TLC, she has held up remarkably well. The engineering is impressive and the styling classic. Some have said reliability is an issue, but that\\'s not what this car is about. Performance, stlying, and design inside and out - that\\'s Audi.  28 mpg in town I love my A4, it handles great and have had no problems. I run 87 octane and regularly get the oil changed (synthetic) I get about 28 mpg in town. Best car I\\'ve ever owned. Horrible Engine - Horrible Company I bought my 2001 A4 1.8T when it was 3 years old with 48K miles on it. I loved it for a while - great snow car, but at 72K, the timing belt failed and ruined the engine. Audi refuses to do anything to help, and I was out $8K for a new engine. Finally traded it in.  Fun, but ughhh The car is nimble and quick with great features, but as far as reliability is concerned, I can\\'t give this car a grade better than a C-. I\\'ve owned the car for two months and have already encountered electrical problems; one being the central locking module which is expensive to replace, but was fixed free of charge from where I purchased the car. The engine just seems sketchy to me. It idles high at start up and blows some smoke from the exhaust at times, but not all the time (like during the test drive *angry face*). Random squeaks and ticks have become common, but it\\'s a different one each time I drive the car. None of the sounds continue for more than one or two drives. It\\'s a nice car, though. 2001 Audi A4 Quattro 2.8 First of all, I can safely say that I still would have made the purchase back in October 2000, knowing what I know now.  The only major disappointment in this vehicle has been the mileage.  It has averaged probably less than 20 MPG (I mostly drive city), and even a fuel tank with 100% freeway miles is probably only averaging 25 or 26 MPG, which isn\\'t great.  Still, that\\'s a minor quibble.  The engine has been a complete dream. No problems whatsoever.  the only glitches on the vehicle have been a leaking washer fluid gasket on the high pressure headlights, a broken elastic piece on the glovebox door, and a loose door handle on the driver\\'s side.  That\\'s it - in over 5 years. I\\'ll buy again.  Love Hate Relationship I just thought I would put my two cents in with the rest of the Audi owners having troubles.  My engine blew out in the middle of Kansas 1 year after buying it used (32000 and Audi certified).  The oil is a big problem.  After that, I have no confidence in the car - it\\'s been back for some minor stuff, but everytime it hiccups or idles funny I get shivers.  Now that I\\'m at 70k and the car is worth 9k or 10k, the repairs are not worth it.  I\\'m waiting on the new BMW 3 series Coupe.  Its a shame. I love driving the car when it works and was looking to mod it, but no way will I put more money into a car I can\\'t trust. 60000 Mile failure I love the driving experience of the A4.  The handling is phenomenal and the comfort is excellent.  Not to mention the heads that turn when I\\'m going down the road.  The only issue was that after 2 months the engine failed and has to be replaced.  It had only 60,000 miles on it.  I would not wish a 1.8T engine on my worst enemy.  Nor would I ever puchase another Audi. Great fun fast and slow Fun to drive, fast or slow. Great highway car for two, cramped for four.   Superb handling, with minimal understeer at limit (with sport suspension).  Excellent fuel mileage if you keep your foot out of the turbo (26-27 consistently, 30 on highway).  Great interior design, plenty of room in front for large folks (I\\'m 6\\'3\"), though small back seats.  Make SURE you use synthetic oil, or change oil frequently.  I\\'ve had this car since new, so these aren\\'t first impressions. I\\'m a Broker I am a wholesale auto broker so I have my pick of vehicles.  And this is the BEST car I have ever owned!!!  I got the car with 38k miles and in the last 14 months have put 43k miles on it, without a single non-routine trip to the shop. The interior styling can\\'t be matched and although I have heard some bad things about the 1.8t my 2.8 V6 is as solid as an engine gets!!!  The whole powertrain is solid and the AWD is a dream come true, I live in Salt Lake City and I\\'m a skier so I make good use of the AWD. However, even on dry pavement you can tell the difference that the AWD makes in handling, performance and SAFETY !!! This car is as smooth and refined as they get, I LOVE IT !!!!!! Too many problems Bought my 2001 A4 2.8 Quattro last year as a cert. pre-owned.  Had to replace the CD player within the first week of having the car.  Since then I\\'ve gone through 2 more CD players.  The electrical system is faulty and just recently I had to replace all the tie-rods which, last year, Audi deemed not covered in the warranty...Thanks Audi.  I\\'ve dropped over $1500 on top of payments this year on the car.  Having to put premium in it is killing me because it only gets 21 mpg, especially when gas prices are $2.50+.  Save your time and money.  Go get something else. I love this car I absolutely love my A4.  It had two recalls but after that it\\'s been my cruise machine.  My only gripe is that it uses Premium gas and that is getting expensive since I have a leadfoot.  I love being able to acelerate and drive in the mountains with all wheel drive and a tiptronic system.  THIS car is zoom zoom. fell apart i love the look and feel of the audi A4 but now that I own one i dont know if I\\'d ever buy another. I bought a 2001 in October of 2003, only three years old and within 4 months of owning it I had to replace the entire engine, due to sludge build up (not caused by myself but a defect in the engine-not under recall). I\\'ve had the car for a year and a half and every two months there seems to be something else wrong with it. I\\'ve replaced the tires, engine, battery, water pump and control arm, totaling $9,000. Maybe if I bought this car brand new it would have been great, but after a couple years, it just fell apart. Beautiful on the outside... I loved this car when I purchased it and up until about a year and a half or so ago.  Since then, I have had nothing but major engine trouble.  The repairs are exceedingly costly, and it is often difficult to find a shop that will work on the newer Audis, due to their intricate design. I have had to replace just about everything in this car, and am now looking at selling the vehicle.  Beware of the type of oil your shop uses; if not using synthetic the engine can seize up.  It\\'s too bad this great car had to go south so young! I hear similar stories from other Audi customers at my dealership.  I would not buy another one. Audi makes great cars My 2001 Audi A4 1.8T quattro Sedan handles well and is easy to maintain.  I only wish there was a little more power with the AWD system.  I have no regrets buying this car! Don\\'t waste your money I leased my 2001 Audi A4 1.8T quattro Sedan new. It was great for the first year. Since then it has been in the shop with multiple problems at least every other month. I\\'ve been to four Audi service centers and each one does a worse job than the other. Audi customer service didn\\'t seem to care either. I\\'m finally fed up with the car and contacted Audi of North America for details on turning it in early...they finally want to talk, but it\\'s too late. We also have had two Volkswagen Jetta\\'s with similar problems. I wouldn\\'t recommend an VW/Audi product. Too many problems Certified does not mean new or even reliable.  I have owned my car for 9 months and its been in the shop at least 5 times, once within 1000 miles to have the engine rebuit and all other problems should have been checked before delivery.  Car rides great handles good and is great in the snow purchase price was good, service has been a nightmare.  I\\'m going back to Saab. 2001.5 A4 I haven\\'t had any problems with the car other than rear wheel bearings and front tie rod ends.  1.8T Bad Engine Design The car\\'s great when it works, but after all the problems the world knows about with the ignition coils, it also has a bad oil filtration system and timing belt tensioner.  Read the bulletin boards for huge repair bills and horror stories of oil pumps seizing and engine belts falling off.  Mine went through two oil pumps and found out the valves needed replacing - all of which Audi refuses to pay for.  Bad engine, bad company.  They tried to make it right when it was small stuff like the coils, but now that it\\'s big engine bills they\\'re stone walling it.  These turbo engines can *ONLY* run on synthetic oil.  Yet the dealers have strict instructions otherwise on leased cars. Bad. 2001 Audi A4 1.8t quattro My 2001 Audi A4 is great.  I\\'ve only had it for six months but its performance is out standing, a little on the slow side but very fun to drive.  I\\'ve driven a lot of cars in my lifetime and this one just does it for me.  The performance upgrades are endless. Who are some of these reviewers I have enjoyed my A4 very much.  Can\\'t add much to what other have said.  My experience with the coil recall was totally unlike another person has reported. Before I had the coil recall work done, I received multiple letters from Audi USA reminding me to bring in my A4 to have ALL the coils replaced FREE of charge; and if I had already paid to have them fixed, to send them copies of the invoices so they could reimburse me IN FULL. Not What I Expected I had high expectations for my Audi A4, \\rand they have been dashed to pieces.  \\rI have had the same problem many \\rothers have had with engine coils (car \\rbroke down completely 3 times this \\ryear alone!)  My dealership covered the \\rrepairs, but the hassle factor was \\rextremely high.  I also had to replace \\rdoor speakers and had a problem with \\rmy driver\\'s side airbag.  My check \\rengine light is on right now and as \\rsoon as I get it back from the \\rdealership I am trading this car in.  \\rMy mother also has an Audi A4 that she \\rhas had much worse problems with \\r(replaced the entire engine twice \\ralong with the transmission!)  \\rMy \"Audi Experience\" has not been a \\rgood one! My Audi experience Overall, I cannot recommend this car.\\rThere are too many good vehicles out\\rthere to settle for this. Even though it\\rdrove well and we felt very safe on it,\\rreliability has been poor, dealership\\rservice has been so-so, and attitude at\\rAudi of NA has been bad. Also, the car\\rseemed to have no resale value. We\\rtraded it in before warranty expired and\\rare now driving a Honda.\\rWe went through the coil recall, and it\\rtook 3 trips to the dealership (and 3\\rtimes almost stranded on the road) to\\rfix. Audi refused to change remaining\\rcoils even though they knew they were\\rdefective: they said warranty only\\rcovers parts when they fail -they lost\\rme as a client right there. We also had\\rthe clutch fail. Silver Streakin\\' I purchased this vehicle with plans to \\rmoderately modify it with a chip and \\rpossibly Euro Xenon headlamps since the \\rspecific car that I was looking at did \\rnot come with Xenon lights.  Well, who \\rknew that I\\'d have a lot more than just \\rthose modifications?  Along with the \\rchip(s) and lights, I have added Stasis \\rTracksport coilovers, StopTech brakes, \\rNeuspeed rear anti-sway bar, Strat \\rshort shifter, Bailey bypass valve, a \\rboost gauge in the center vent, APR \\rsnub mount and AWE DTS to firm up the \\rdrivetrain as well as a few other \\rmods.  The more I add to this car, the \\rmore I enjoy it at driver\\'s schools via \\rthe Audi clubs and other high \\rperformance driving schools. German cars: Love Em! This has been a great car for us.  It is\\ra lot of fun to drive and everyone at\\rthe dealerships go above and beyond to\\rservice their customers.  We\\'ve had the\\rcar for almost four years now and all\\rthat we\\'ve had to do is have the oil\\rchanged, which is included in the\\rwarranty.  Owning our first Audi has\\rbeen a great experience and I often\\rrecommend the A4 to others. New to Audi Purchased a pre-owned 2001 A4 1.8t \\rQuattro.\\r Sales experience: Best I\\'ve ever had.  \\rAudi of Mendham, NJ, was fantastic in \\revery respect and exceeded my \\rexpectations.  Also looked at Infinity \\rI30, Lexus ES300 and Acura TL.  \\rInfinity was more luxury oriented but \\rdealership was beyond horrible (Lynnes \\rin Bloomfield, NJ).  Lexus was too \\rexpensive and the 2002 model made the \\r2001 look like crap (styling \\rchanges).  Acura was great but \\rexterior styling for 2001 was bland.\\r The Car: Have to get used to turbo \\rpower coming on, but it does.  Feels \\rvery luxurious, yet sporty enough to \\rkeep you \"cool\".  Grips the road with \\rconfidence.  Small interior can be a \\rproblem Exceptional This car is exceptional in most every  Audi A4, great car I love in Colorado where the quattro is\\rvery nice to have.  I have just over\\r45,000 miles on my A4 and it has been\\rvery reliable.  \\r The only problem I have had is with the\\rdriver\\'s side window \\'whistling\\' a bit.\\r After 3 trips to the dealer, it was\\rfinally fixed, under warranty.\\r Other than that, I absolutely love the\\rcar and plan to purchase it when it\\rcomes off of lease in August 2005. Almost perfect - Highly Recommended After driving a 1999 1.8T (I\\'ve been \\rloyal to American car makers for too \\rlong) - I pulled it off the used market \\rand decided to keep it after a month. I \\rwill never go back to US cars. With all \\rthe complaints on this forum regarding \\rsome experiences with reliability, \\rit pales in comaprison. I traded the \\'99\\rin with 80k and the engine and tranny \\rwere in great shape. Now own a 2001 \\r2.8 and am amazed at the improvement \\rover the crisp performance of the 99 \\r1.8T. It\\'s styling is timeless and \\rclassic and IMO belongs with such \\rclassic designs as the 57 Chevy, 67 \\rmustang,  among others. This is a \\rkeeper. Buy Certified if used. Not Worth It I have a \\'67 Mustang that has less \\rproblems!!!.  Nothing but electrical \\rproblems since I\\'ve had it.  ABS unit \\rneeded to be replaced twice (without a \\rwarning light...that\\'s comforting), \\rcontrol box for door locks had to be \\rreplaced (couldn\\'t even get in the \\rcar!!), most recently, had to have all \\rdashboard electronics replaced after \\rradio froze (couldn\\'t change stations \\ror anything) and dash disply went \\rdead.  If you have to have one, lease, \\rand not for longer than the warranty.   Not Worth It I have a \\'67 Mustang that has less \\rproblems!!!.  Nothing but electrical \\rproblems since I\\'ve had it.

However, our experience with the a\\rdifferent dealer for maintenance (Royal\\rMotors in SF) has been ABSOLUTELY\\rHORRIBLE. Audi dealer mechanics are\\rbonused based on customer feedback. We\\rdidn\\'t know this when we filled out the\\rAudi feedback letter after our 1st\\rservice at Royal Motors. One of the\\rmechanics left a voice mail on our home\\rphone complaining about how our low\\rfeedback score was going to hurt his\\rcompensation. To top it off, every time\\rwe go back, we get this\\rpassive-aggressive treatment from the\\remployees, with petty comments like \"I\\rsee you gave ___ a low score\" years\\rafter that feedback was submitted. 2001 A4 1.8T FWD Great car...only wish I had held out  Great car, terrible company I can think of very few things that I \\rdon\\'t like about the actual car. It\\'s \\rfun to drive, the ecru/black interior \\rlooks great and is easy to keep clean, \\rthe trunk is huge for the car\\'s size. \\rHowever, I will never purchase another \\rAudi again due to the HORRIBLE service \\rprovided by dealers and Audi of \\rAmerica. Everything is a hassle, from a \\rsimple oil change to getting a loaner \\rcar. The warranty does not limit the \\ramount of alignments that can be \\rperformed during the warranty period, \\rhowever Audi will now only allow 1 per \\ryear...what a sham.  I\\'ve dealt with 2 \\rdifferent dealerships with the same \\r(low) level of satisfaction. Excellent I love this car.  In the 3 years I have \\rhad it there has been virtually no \\rproblems, it gets great gas mileage for \\ra performance car, and it\\'s solid all \\raround.  I like it so much I\\'m going to \\rbuy it off the lease cause I won\\'t be \\rable to get the quality of this vehicle \\rfor the price range I can get it vs. \\rgetting another car. So far so good I\\'ve owned this car for about 8 months, \\rand so far I love it.  The driving \\rposition is ideal (unlike other \\rreviewers, I love the position of the \\rarmrest), and I find the car to be very \\rcomfortable for both short and long \\rtrips.  Not to mention the fact that it \\ris gorgeous!  Truly one of the best \\rlooking cars on the road.  Nothing but \\rgood things to say about the service \\rdept so far (hopefully that will stay \\rthe same when the warranty runs out \\rlater this year) tricked out A4 I love my A4 to death, but I\\'d never \\rrecommend one. Simply too many small \\rproblems; the vac lines went (I \\rreplaced them myself), a bent \\rhose \"shredded itself,\" \\rthe ignition coils went out and were \\rreplaced by the dealership - but only \\rone by one, even though they had a \\rdesign flaw. In the mean time I had to \\rhave the car towed twice and drove it \\ron three cylinders once - not fun.\\rIf you\\'re into cars and don\\'t mind \\rrepairing them yourself, go for it. I \\rhave mine completely tricked out with a \\rstage 3 turbo upgrade (~280 hp/300 ft-\\rlbs; 310+ hp with race gas, for which I \\ralso have an additional program), \\rupgraded coilover suspension, A8 \\rbrakes, swaybar, etc. Great car for 2 years!!! For the first 2yrs it was great.  Then \\r3 enigine coils went bad, gas \\rsensor,temperature gague, the cam seal \\rhas a oil leak that the dealership \\rfixed 3 times, the instrument panel \\rwent bad as well.  I would not recomend \\rthis car to anyone. It is not reliable! Most fun I ever had This car handles like a dream.  Takes \\rthe curves like it\\'s on rails.  \\rAccelerates quickly from a dead stop.  \\rStock pirelli tires were destroyed by \\rnew york potholes, purchased Pilot A/S, \\rno more blown tires. The interior is \\rnice enough to get positive comments \\rfrom passengers. The stereo is okay, \\rbut could be better. As for \\rreliability, I had problems with the \\rfollowing: Oil pump, power windows, \\rsunroof, locks, tensioner, recall on \\riginition coil.  My next car will be a \\rJapanese make for the reliability. Had \\rmy integra past 110,000 miles and only \\rreplaced clutch and brakes. Lots of fun for a sedan This is the very first Audi I have  Buy an Acura instead Do yourself a favor and buy an Acura  Good, if not great... I\\'ve done a variety of driving in this \\rcar, (city, highway, long trips), and it\\'s \\ralways performed nicely. It\\'s fun to \\rdrive, feels rock solid, will go through \\ralmost anything with Quattro, \\rresponds nicely to all \\rdriver input and looks great. I wish it \\rgot better gas mileage and the \\rinterior was more comfortable. The \\rarmrest sucks, the cup holders blow, \\rthe automatic climate control system \\ris on drugs half the time and the \\rseats are less than luxurious. All that \\raside, (and those are \\rsome minor gripes), i think it\\'s a \\rgreat car. Speaking of minor, the \\rbackseat is a joke, but what do i \\rcare, i sit up front!\\r I like it even more after owning it. I\\'ve extensively upgraded with performance \\rparts since buying new in May of 2001.  The \\rcar is incredibly fun to drive with plenty of \\rpower, while still remaining very fuel-\\refficient over long distances.  Had the coil-\\rpack replaced when recalled, had the \\rcupholder replaced when the trim broke.  \\rReplaced one headlight bulb.  Everything \\relse is perfect! Great traction The steering with quattro is \\rfantastic - travelling on a wet and \\rrainy I-95 at speed, a wheel cover \\rfrom an oncoming car, came over the \\rcentral median - closing speed at \\rleast 140 mph. I swerved to avoid a \\rdirect hit the car calmly swung right \\rand then back left to avoid the wheel \\rcover and the car on the inside lane \\rwithout missing a beat - having owned \\ra BMW 540i previously I can safely say \\rthat had I been in that car I would \\rnot have stayed on the highway !\\rAlso the handling is exceptional in \\rsnow conditions - brilliant,cannot say \\renough good things about the handling \\rof this car. one great car Awesome really fun car...i have a BMW  Unreliable Great handling, but it breaks down and \\rthe dealers can\\'t fix it or get parts. \\rOr, they fix it incorrectly and it has \\rto be towed back. bet your life on it Let me start by saying that I was in a \\rhead-on collision just 2 weeks ago and \\rmy 2001 A4 performed just as it should \\rhave, safely.\\rIt is an incredibly solid and safe \\rautomobile. All the minor complaints \\r(lame cupholder and small back-seat) I \\ronce had about the car have receded \\rinto the past.\\rTo be able to walk away from a bad \\raccident is the best testament anyone \\rcan give for a car.  \\r   Solid, sporty, and  fun to tinker with Bought this car brand new, and now have \\rabout 33k miles. No major problems; a \\rfew burnt out headlights, the ashtray \\ris stuck, and coffee stickiness has \\rmade the cupholder stick sometimes. \\rReplaced the stock goodyears at 27k \\rwith sticky Yokohamas and \"chipped\" the \\rECU with Neuspeed at 24k for 30  more \\rhorsepower. Other enhancements include \\ra K&N air filter.  Got a check engine \\rlight due to busted vacuum hose, and \\rnoisy cam tensioner, but all replaced \\runder warranty.  Car is noisier now, \\rrattles, etc. but still solid. Plan to \\rkeep for a few more years. Outstanding Car! I own three Audis: a 2001 A4 2.8Q, a \\r2000 A6 2.8Q Avant, and a 1997 \\rCabriolet.  All three are wonderful \\rcars, and serve different purposes.  \\rThe 2001 A4 is great fun to drive, and \\rat 30k miles, I\\'ve not had one \\rmechanical problem.  Also, the 2.8 \\rengine does not have the coil issues \\rpresent in some 1.8T engines.  The \\rdesign of the \\'01 is a classic: clean \\rlines in the Bauhaus tradition.  Note: \\rAt 75K miles, Audi\\'s can have gasket \\rleaks (my 2000 A6 Avant did), but \\rthat\\'s not uncommon for any German \\rperformance car.  Fit and finish are \\rflawless, and my dealer (Nalley Audi / \\rAtlanta) is first rate.  I will own \\rnothing but Audis! Wouldn\\'t buy an Audi again While the 2001 Audi A4 can be fun to \\rdrive, it\\'s had FAR too many mechanical \\rproblems for such a new car (45,000 \\rmiles). Windshield fluid pump, brakes \\r(had to change the entire brake set, \\rcouldn\\'t do just the pads!), airbag, \\rnow something with a faulty oil system \\r(it\\'s been there the last 3 days), and \\rother strange things. Also do not like \\rits low clearance, it just invites \\rripping off the front bumper guard on a \\rparking space divider. Would never buy \\rAudi again after this one. I can\\'t wait \\rto sell the car and go back to Toyota.  My favorite car, ever. I chose the A4 over the BMW 3-series \\rbecause you get so much more for your \\rmoney. I\\'ve never regretted it. It \\rhandles great, has excellent pickup, \\rand, with the Quattro AWD, I am safe \\rand glued to the road.  Fit and finish \\rare tight, and there\\'s a feeling of \\rsolidity.  I think the 1.8T is one of \\rthe best small engines ever made.  \\rI\\'ve never had a disabling mechanical \\rproblem.  There was a recall for \\rreplacement of faulty coils, but I \\rnever had the faulty coils.  \\rReliability has been excellent.  I love this car! The A4 is an excellent combination of \\rperformance and comfort in a smaller \\rcar. With the addition of the \\rBridgestone Pole Position ties this car \\rdrives like it is on flypaper, \\respecially on sweeping curves where \\rmany BMW driver has only the view of my \\rfour rings disappearing in the distance \\rahead of them. :) Service center wait times Although I love my car I would not  Best buy I ever made I got the car in July 2001 and have not \\rhad any problems with it.  Features I \\rgot are manual transmission, Bose sound \\rsystem, sports package, winter package \\rand leather interior.  Everything was \\rwell worth it.  Only car I know where \\rthe doors all open 90 degrees.  How \\rmany cars do you know with a FULL-SIZE \\rspare tire just in case and 8 \\r(count \\'em, 8!) airbags?  Fun to drive \\rin summer and winter.  Only regret is \\rthat I could not get an S4 Avant!!!  \\rBMW owners just don\\'t know what they \\rare missing. 2001 Audi A4 2.8 I bought this car a week ago and 1 day \\rlater the radio buttons went out, a \\rheadlight wire was loose and the \\rcupholder needed to be replaced because \\rit stuck.  The radio was also replaced. \\rI wonder what is next and am afraid to \\rtake it on a long trip for fear \\rsomething will stop working.   so far so good I am a guy who keeps his cars for over \\r10 years if possible, I was concerned \\rthat the Audi would not hold up.  It is \\ra bit early to say, but it is going \\rwell so far.  I will have to replace \\rthe tires as there is a slow leak and I \\rhad to change the CD player (at no \\rcost) but otherwise all is well.  The \\rcar seems to be somewhat noiser that it \\ruse to be.  I hope it holds up for a \\ranother 8 years !!!\\rEric A4 #2 and I love it! I had a 1996 manual A4 Quattro,sold it \\rto my brother and bought the 2001 \\rautomatic with triptronic. I love these \\rcars! Once you sit in one and drive, \\ryou are spoiled for life! Buyer Beware I\\'ve only owned the car for a few \\rmonths and have had it die on me \\rtwice.  All 2001 Audis have faulty \\rengine coils, mine have broken twice \\ralready and supposedely have now all \\rbeen replaced with new non-faulty \\rcoils. In the process a tow truck \\rripped off my front spoiler and I \\rfought with them for over two moths for \\rreplacement compensation. My dealership \\rwas unsympathetic and useless. I bought \\rthe car based on reliability and \\rcustomer service, I have found both to \\rbe completely lacking and \\runsatisfactory.  Never buy an Audi \\rwithout the original warranty \\rremaining. Instead, go buy a Lexus or \\rAcura, that\\'s what I\\'ll be doing next. Best Car I\\'ve Ever Owned My previous car was a Mercedes, and I\\'ve \\rowned about twenty other cars in my \\rlifetime, and this is the best , so far. I\\'m a \\rdesigner, and love the clean design. With \\rthe Quattro AWD system, the car corners \\rlike it is on rails -- wet or dry. But the quality \\rof materials and workmanship is what really \\rsets this car apart from others -- and it was a \\rlot less expensive than my Mercedes. I will \\rbuy another Audi. 2001 Audi A4 1.8 Turbo: My Supercar This is the best looking Audi to come love it The car has been very reliable, and I\\rhave had no major problems. It handles\\rgreat; it is fun to drive on twisty\\rroads, and is good in snow as well.\\rPower is very good considering actual\\rdisplacement of engine, but it isn\\'t as\\rtorquey as say a Volkswagen VR6 or a BMW\\rinline 6. Mileage is good -- I get 28\\rmpg on the highway going 80 mph. Very\\rnice looking inside and out. A4 Quattro Extremely capable car.  Even with very  I can not recomend this Car 56000 miles Don\\'t Buy This Car! I bought a 2001 A4 in Sept. of 2001 and \\rit has given me nothing but problems.  \\rIn a little over a year I have had a \\rlaundry list of problems ranging from \\rengine problems (cylinder coil, faulty \\roil pump, problems with the turbo,etc.) \\rto safety problems (faulty air bag) to \\rjust plain annoying problems like a \\rleak in my rear windshield, leak in the \\rwasher fluid system, bad CD player, \\rbuttons on the console that stopped \\rworking, and an ashtray that doesn\\'t \\ropen!  It seems i\\'ve been driving a \\rrental more than my own car. If I \\rwanted to drive a Ford Escort I would \\rhave bought one! DON\\'T BUY AN AUDI!! Super automobile A great car to drive both in the winter \\rand summer. No problems in the snow and \\rice. I love to have people test me on \\rthe freeway, the turbo will blow them \\raway. this car looks great both inside \\rand out. I love the way the seats feel \\rand the comfort they provide. I don\\'t \\rhave anybody to sit in the back so \\rthere is plent of room for the kid. Had \\rminor problems with a faulty read from \\ra loose sensor. Audi A4 Turbo Sedan Fun to drive. Great handling in tight \\rturns and high speeds, great mileage, \\rinterior is very well styled and audio \\rsystem is good. Beautiful exterior \\rdesign, and center panel is awesome, \\rglows red when lights are turned on. I like it. The car is fun to drive on mountain roads for me and nice to drive to church \\rfor my wife.  As she says, it just goes right along.  The interior is beautiful \\rand apparently well put together.  But it creaks more than our 1987 Acura \\rIntegra did. LOVE MY CAR I bought this car over a year ago.  I \\rusually tire of things quickly, but I \\rstill LOVE this car.  The engine is \\rgreat, instruments and accessories are \\rgreat quality, and it handles like a \\rdream.  I have the quattro suspension, \\rand my husband and I tried to make it \\rspin out in a gravel parking lot and \\rin rain.  It wouldn\\'t budge off the \\rroad.  Made it through the whole \\rwinter without a single slide or \\rfishtail.  I feel very safe in this \\rcar.  This car has quality written all \\rover it. audi = german for lemon Although this car is loads of fun, it \\rspends more time at the shop than on \\rthe road.  The first 25k miles went \\rgreat, but since then:  (1) faulty \\rdrive chain tensioner (could have bent \\rvalves and destroyed engine if i hadn\\'t \\rnoticed it), (2) front main oil seal \\rleak (at 26k miles absurd), (3)turn \\rsignal switch failed, and (4) oxygen \\rsensor failed (car shut down on the \\rroad.  If i had been on the interstate \\rinstead of secondary road i could have \\rbeen rear ended by semi.)  \\r All covered by warranty, but you can \\rbet I\\'ll dump this car as soon as \\rwarranty ends.  This car is like \\rmarrying a supermodel that hates sex.  \\rLooks great but doesn\\'t perform. A Good Car, A Strong Car, A Good Choice A petite car with the power of a \\rbulldozer. It\\'s a car to drive when \\ryou want to pass another going uphill, \\rdownhill, and, any other way you need \\rto drive safely and quickly; To feel \\rit grip the road on icy, waterey, \\rsnowy roads you\\'ll immediately be \\rthankful for selecting a car with AWD-\\rit\\'s an awesome feel of safety, \\rcomfort and security. Handles Like a Champ This car handles like a champ. There \\ris no system in the world better than \\rthe Quattro all wheel drive. I cant \\rger over the power and capability in \\rthe rain. The car could use a little \\rmore power. But with a chip, it makes \\rit MOVE. Really Terrible Car with Great Attraction This car is so expensive to fix even if you are a mechanic.  There is nothing that you or any mechanic can work on that doesn\\'t include removing 9 different things in order to access the parts.  It is a NIGHTMARE.  I got more for my car when I parted it out than what I paid for it because the parts are ridiculously expensive, the dealers control access to parts and the part fail consistently.  Based on just the common misfires on this model (which could be one of 10 different problems) I would NEVER buy a used Audi ever again.  Positives... Really great sporty drive, great sound system, great look. Cute car with LOTS of problems I loved this car when I first bought it, but in a short time I had SO many problems with it, including problems with coils, compressor, air flow sensor, motor mounts, vacuum leak, and more.My engine burned up and they refused to replace under warranty because I was slightly over my oil change and therefore \\'violated my warranty contract conditions\\' according to Audi, even though the delay was so minor it could not cause such a problem (sludge, not lack of oil).I later did a Google search for \"Audi engine sludge\" and found similar complaints from others.It\\'s very difficult and expensive to fix.This car is adorable and fun to drive, but wow did it do damage to my wallet.  Get extended warranty It\\'s fun to drive, kinda slow for you speed freaks. There\\'s a blind spot when the top is up. Also had to replace my tranny at 51,500 miles. YES 1500 miles past warranty expiration. They paid for half. I think they should have paid for all. Now I am finding out they do not hold their value AT ALL! Very expensive car to drive. WON\\'T EVER BUY AN AUDI AGAIN! The Navi UI stinks and is very confusing. Fun to drive but MAJOR Flaws I bought the Audi with 36K miles 2 years ago. It now has 53K miles. While it was under warranty It was in the shop 3 times for semi major issues. I didn\\'t care because it was under warranty and they gave me loaner cars. Then at 51,500 Miles the CVT TRANSMISSION went out. Yes AUDI paid for half, but they gave me 3 days to tell them to I would accept their offer. SO I had to pay $3500 out of pocket for something that would have been under warranty two months before. If you Google Audi and CVT transmissions and TCM\\'s you will see there are hundreds of Audi\\'s complaints about this. Yes it\\'s fun to drive though.  3.0 Quatro A4 Cabriolet I do enjoy this car since I first got it. The interior designed was great and so its interior: wooden dash, leather seats quality worth every pennies. There were few problems after 10k miles of driving like the cable to the trunk cover for convertible top, rear light bulb. The other major issues was the ignition coils that went bad, check engine light on. The dealership had it replaced no costs. The car has 30k miles and still running like new without any other issues. Overall, this car is the best so far since my past cars: Benz, Acura, Lexus. Plus, its convertible top and silver color made it stand out. I couldn\\'t came up with any reason to get rid of it other than high payments. It\\'s worth it... The cvt transmission takes some time to get used to. This car is amazing, the top is great, gets decent gas mileage but requires premium. Audi does have problems with dealer communications... Seems you have to do your own research if you want anything fixed at the dealer. Discontinuedthe warranty is out it\\'s going to an independent shop. It\\'s a pain but totally worth it! Great car but... Well, it is a great car. Convertible and great gas mileage. Fun to drive and gorgeous to look at. I recommend that you buy one if you can but make sure that it comes with a warranty. These cars cost a lot of money to fix when they break and make sure that the dealer will take care of the problem for you. My 05 A4 at 38k just encountered a transmission problem and I never thought that I would have any kind of problem with this car that involved the transmission. My warranty expired 3 months ago and the cost to fix is $1600 for a modulator. The next thing that I\\'m going to purchase for this car is a warranty. But it is a great car! Nice car but get extended warranty I have a 2005 Audi A4 Convertible 3.0.  I LOVE MY CAR! The only thing is that when you have issues, it\\'s EXPENSIVE! I bought my Audi with 60K miles on it in 2008.  Yes, quite a bit of miles on it already, but it looked brand new. I paid $23K out which incl a 4 year/100K mi warranty. I had to replace the transmission computer but that was covered under Audi warranty (just for CA I was told). No coverage - looking at almost $2K! There are too many electrical \"gadgets\" on this car NOT to have an extended warranty unless you buy new. Other then a blown fuse that controlled the top and trunk (only $2.99 for a pack of fuses) and the start of a coolant leak (yikes) no issues. I currently have 77K mi. Used but perfect!! After looking around for a new A4 Cab, I decided to save some bucks and get one with all the bells and whistles. No disappointments here... great car, perfect size, appointments and styling. I\\'ve had many near and full luxury autos... this one\\'s the best. All the performance but with an understated brand. Love this car! The worst car I have ever owned The A4 Audi Cabrolet was a disaster from the start. Between the car\\'s computer problems (brake and the accelerator not coordinated correctly, windows not closing as designed, timer not resetting, top not going down or up, etc...) Audi is a bad choice for a car of your dreams. Not only did Audi fail to fix the problems, Audi 1-800 # was useless: they sided with the dealers on most everything. Audi would not let me meet an Audi Rep to go over my concerns. They blame almost everything on owner abuse. There are too many other things that didn\\'t work to mention. Think twice before you buy an Audi, unless you have deep pockets and enjoy the mental stress of dealing with a bottom line company. A fun car in all respects I parted with a \\'93 Toyota Supra for my Audi 3.0 Quattro convertible.  It has it all---style, performance, luxury, all wheel drive, comfort---the whole package.  I\\'ve been nothing but pleased with the car. For style + safety, this is the car for you. My first convertible After deciding to spring for my first convertible it didn\\'t take long to see that Audi had engineered a great package with the A4 Cabriolet.  It feels solid on the road.  The V-6 has plenty of juice to merge into traffic, and the styling is subtle but elegant.  And, you don\\'t see yourself coming and going on the road.  Its taken 9 months before I finally passed myself on the interstate.  For my 6\\'1\" linebacker frame, I wasn\\'t sure I could find a convertible I felt comfortable in, but the A4 Cab. has one of the most comfortable and supportive cabins out there if your a big guy like me.  The top operation is flawless and road noise is much less than I thought.  All in all, a great convertible! Best all around-er Absolutely wonderful car!  Great looking/performing sporty 4 seater convertible with all-wheel-drive for Omaha winters.. you won\\'t be disappointed with this one! Most enjoyable ride ever... After much research and test drives, I purchased my A4 Cab. It fits me , it\\'s fun, it has great style, is fast enough to get into trouble, and better than my 4-runner in snow. I had heard rumors of poor service and maintnence troubles. No frets and regrets. Great Car This car has given me no trouble and it is a piece of jewelry to look at.  I love the way it sounds and it handles great.  The only downside to this car is that too many people notice me which isn\\'t a downside at all.  Now as far as power, Audi really did not give enough oomph for a V6 and I am disappointed.  However I do love the car despite its slow tendencies. Awesome Great car.  Looks good feels good drives like a dream.  The Quaddro system makes for improved handling not just on snow or wet roads but handles far better than a comprable BMW. A4 Audi Cabrio is service intensive I checked out every compact convert on the market before stepping up and buying the A4. Let me say., I LOVE THIS CAR. I also need to say, LOVE THY AUDI SERVICE MANAGER. The car needs a lot of attention to keep it at its max. Small crap, but still, you need to take it in like most German vehicles. Electronics, brake squeals, AC issues, electric window motor, engine computer idle issues, and so on. But, if this car were stolen today, I\\'d buy another one later today. Better looks and ride than BMW 3 series, but consider the V8 S4, which doesn\\'t have the power robbing CVTransmission. Perhaps my absolute favorite convert (I\\'ve owned at least 2 dozen of them) tight and taut. And fab looking. Loving My Audi A4 Cabriolet I have had this cabriolet for only 3+ months, but it has exceeded my expectations in almost every category. It is quiet, stable, power enough for most driving, gets about 21 mpg, has very positive steering, takes the bumps well, has great eye appeal, and the upgraded sound system was worth it for an open top car.  The trunk is one of the roomier ones for a convertible. With all options it is pricey.  I cannot help but feel that with this kind of quality, the resale value for Audi A4 Cabriolet will rise significantly.  This is a car well above what I thought an Audi might be.  It is hard to imagine this not being a best seller, and a 1st pick for convertible lovers. fun, fun, fun A perfect car for someone with a family living in the northern climate:  a convertible with room in the back for kids, AND a quiet roof and Quattro AWD for winter driving.  It is really two cars in one. audi A4 convert. The car exceeds expectations.  Not as hot as the quattro or S4 by any means, it is still very peppy.  Rides more solidly than any other comparable convertible (BMW, Saab, Volvo) I tried. Fun, fun, fun Doesn\\'t get any better!!! Have had any number of converts over the years, and have two other Audis currently (2004 All Road and 2005 A6 4.2)  this is the one that I can\\'t wait to get into.....even on a really cold day, as long as it\\'s not snowing (I live in New Mexico). The stability of the 4xdrive and the 3.0 make is a total blast to hit the high road. I can even get 4 people in it. Can\\'t wait for real summer! Just buy one!!! Audi cabriolet Drives great, lost of fun to drive with the top down. Looks great in black with tan interior. Small leg room in the back seat, but still comfortable. Winner - A4 Carbiolet After examining all of the top marquees the Audi A4 was the big winner for topless driving. IMHO it represents the best performance, style, quality, and value for topless luxury/performance driving in the four- seat category. And our dealer treated us like royalty when others thought the A4 1.8T price level was not worth their effort.  If you are considering topless driving give the A4 a serious look. Test with & w/o sport suspension. Not for everyone but great for me. Love the handling, lighting, interior, and wonderful aesthetics. Top is awesome and down 90% of the time. over the long haul The car is as fun to drive today as it was in Nov 02 when I purchased the car.  I took a chance with a new model but it has worked out well.  The cabin is a driver\\'s cabin, and with all the safety features I feel safe even with the top down cruising on challenging roads.  As other reviewers have noted the ride is choppy going over speed bumps at slow speeds but other than that the car does not disappoint and provides me with an excellent experience. Great Little Car Have had my newest love for two months and 4,000 miles.  Single touch up/down top with glass back window and a covered boot is superior.  Stock sound system is as good as BMW\\'s Harmon Kardon.  This is a sloooow car.  Replaced my 2002 Honda S2000 which was fast but a bit hard on the body.  Compares more than favorably to my 1999 323 BMW convertible with one exception. COOLEST CAR ON THE PLANET! I replaced my Miata with the A4 convertible. Not just a step up, but 100 steps up! I compared it with the BMW 300 serier and the Mercedes. No comparison for me. The creature features are over the top on the A4. I want luxury inside with a luxury exterior & price & ride = you don\\'t all that with the BMW or Mercedes. The interior is beautiful & functional & comfortable. Can you tell I love it! A4 cabriolet The car is a dream to drive.  Very efficient for fuel.  Love the power top.  Do not like where the cruise control is placed.  Great idea to have the space under both seats used for storage.  The car is a little noisy at the lower gears but is quick in traffic to get in and out of lanes.  Rear seats do not have a lot of room - good for short people or dogs.  I am glad I do not have to sit there.  I do a lot of travel on the interstate and the 6th gear is just great.  This is a 4 cylinder with a lot of pep.  Highly recommend this car.  I\\'ve got the manual! The 2005 Audi A4 3.0 quattro Cabriolet is a great car. The AWD has been great when driving up to the mountains when there is lots of snow. I can use the \"ski\" bag for two snowboards with bindings on, which is great for a convertible. The car is incredibly quiet on the road. This car is very comfortable even at top speeds with the top down, although the Bose 9-speaker stereo has a hard time getting heard at those speeds. Fun in the Sun I have been an Audi driver for years, with a recent interruption, but now I\\'m back.  My new 1.8L Turbo CVT Cabriolet is a sporty, responsive, yet elegant vehicle that is an attention-getter everywhere we go.  Very fun to drive. Too much fun! This car has the styling, fit, finish, and aesthetics to beat the more expensive brands. I felt the BMW was lacking in refinement and the MB was over priced. The CVT feels like a manual trans when starting \\x96 cool! The sport suspension is fantastic but BETTER BRAKES are needed. The top works well. The interior has plenty of room but the cup holders are less than ideal. Radio with RDS and in-dash display along with driver computer is really neat. Love the red gauge displays. Buy this car! It\\'s a head-turner We like our 2004 Audi A4 3.0 Cabriolet very much. Space is definitly not her strength; but we knew that when we got it. This car\\'s engine performance is excellent. The interior quality is very good. It is a little on the pricy side; but we also knew that. Great Ride Our 2005 A4 3.0 Cabriolet is our 7th Audi and clearly the best.  My wife drives an A6 Avant quattro, which also is a winner.  Other than the lousy design of the console, the car is the best looking and the most fun to drive of any I have ever owned.  I went from a Land Rover Discovery to the A4 Cab.  It was a great Move!  Topless Audi is the Tops I just purchased my Audi A4 Cabriolet after comparison shopping all of it\\'s competitors\\'s convertibles.  This car is much roomier than the BMW 3-Series and has more interior charm as well.  In comparison to the SAAB, there is none.  The handling is superb and the solidity of the car is astounding!  It is extremely quiet, with no wind noise even at higher speeds.  The options are easy to choose, but most models do have premium accomodations.  I highly recommend taking one out for a test drive...You won\\'t be sorry, you\\'ll be sold! sporty, fun and classy After driving a Toyota Supra for years, I bought the Audi 3.0 quattro convertible and haven\\'t regretted it at all . While not the sports car the Supra is, the Audi handles great and adds a luxurious interior to boot.  From the inside you can hardly tell it\\'s a convertible--quiet and no shakes even at high speeds. On the highway, the car practically drives itself.   The seats adjust a thousand ways so anyone can be comfortable.  I love the way the passenger side mirror tilts down so you can see the curb when backing up. With the top down & the wind deflector up, the joys of convertible ownership are impeccable, and snow is no object either with the quattro. A great all-season vehicle. It\\'s a Beauty I just purchased my 2005 Audi A4 3.0 Cabriolet with quattro after a long research period as I needed an all season convertable which can withstand harsh winters. This one perfectly fit the criteria. It is excellent for cold weather winter driving, being all wheel drive. It does not have a rough sports car feel and has a comfortable smooth ride. It is slightly low on horsepower but OK for my driving nature. The interior and exterior are the best in its class, especially the interior. It has enough back room for two average size adults. So far I love it.  California Dream Absolute fun to drive! Room for 4 \\radults. Simple, clean trim. Sport \\rpackage is a must. A bit underpowered \\rat lower speeds, but the fun factor \\reasily compensates for power issues.  Great Car We traded an Audi for a Mercedes and \\rkept it 10 years but we had to go back \\rto Audi as it was the best automobile \\rthat we had ever owned.  The dealer is \\rtop notch, the new car is even better. The 2005 Is A Mess & I\\'ve Had Two! This car is a piece of @#&*!  I\\'ve had \\rtwo 2005s.  The first one made a noise \\rso bad people in the lane next to me \\rremarked.  The dealer, no help from \\rAudi, gave me a new one for another \\r$1,500 bucks.  The new one had the \\rcheck engine light appear under 300 \\rmiles.  The shop had it for 5 days, \\rdelivered it and the engine light \\rappeared again.  My service shop has \\rput more miles on the car delivering \\rit to me then I\\'ve put on the car \\rdriving it.  Under 500 miles and it\\'s \\rgoing back tomorrow.  This is a new \\ridentical car.  The first one was a \\rturbo, transmission, electrical mess. \\rAudi refuses to stand behind their \\rauto. Maybe your dealer will as good \\ras mine and help you. Buy at your own \\rrisk. Too Good to be TRUE Car delivered last week. What an \\rwonderful car!! Makes my old Sebring \\rseem like a bucket of bolts. Great \\rstyling, ride, comfort, and lots of \\rcompliments and looks from everyone. \\rAudi promised alot and delivers even \\rmore.  This car truely makes you want \\rto get up in the morning and go for a \\rdrive. If you are looking for a class \\rcar and don\\'t want to be just another \\rJoe in a Beamer or Benz...this is the \\rcar for you.  I even got praise from my \\rfather-in-law who is the world\\'s \\rbiggest car critic! Lt. Silver metalic \\rwith black interior is a real head \\rturner. V6 delivers exceptional power \\racross all ranges. Lot\\'s of toys and \\rcomfort features. The interior quality \\ris to die for!  3.0 quattro 2005 A4 LOVE this car! traded in sebring \\rchrysler convertible that i \"thought\" \\rI loved. NO COMPARISON! Fun Meets Practical The minute I got behind the wheel of \\rthis car was the minute I fell in \\rlove.  The driver\\'s seat is so \\rcomfortable that if you didn\\'t know \\ryou were in a car, you would swear you \\rwere sitting in a leather \\rrecliner.  As for performance, boy \\rdoes this car deliver!  Not only does \\rit excelerate with ease and give you \\rthat sporty engine rev but it also \\rhandles well on any type of road.  The \\rsport and triptonic features are so \\reasy to use that they put the fun back \\rin driving an automatic.  As with all \\rrecent Audi styles, you feel protected \\ron all sides without feeling like you \\rare driving a tank.  Not only is this \\rcar a joy to drive (especially at high \\rspeeds) it Lemon Although pretty to look at, and fun \\renough to drive, the design \\rshortcomings and limited features \\rquickly became tiresome.  Mediocre fit \\rand finish was just the beginning of \\rour experience with a car that went \\rback for repair over and over.  What \\rstarted out as chasing rattles and \\rloose trim lead to a noisy \\rundercarraige and a replaced \\rtransmission.  The dealer did all the \\rwarranty work with a smile, but we took \\rthe hint and traded it in for another \\rbrand car, built in a whole different \\rcountry.  The car is fine for a test \\rdrive, but soon disappoints. Cabriolet Review Have only had for a week.  We traded in \\ra 2002 TT Roadster due to bad \\rvisibility driving with the top up.  \\rThe A4 is sensational, roomy and fun to \\rdrive.   Don\\'t be fooled by Das Vagen  The vast majority of SUV owners avoid  mud and rocks but everyone thinks they need one. Wagons are underpriced because they are not fashionable and that works for me. More versatile than a sedan and as much interior space as most small SUVs. Split rear seats have plenty of legroom. The Audi Vagen is best of both worlds legendary AWD performance and handling.The 2.0 engine is peppy and when you select S  \"overdrive\" outrageous acceleration. Leather power everything dual AC premium sound the list goes on. We bought the wagon 23,00 now at 45K could not be happier. Drives well carries dogs, bikes ,supplies. \"Gets up and Audi\\'s\" on the highway. Only complaint they have stopped making wagons Fun car but Purchased the car 9 months ago with 49,000 miles; seemingly low mileage for the year.  So far the car has needed 2 ignition coils, a cam shaft adjustment, the coolant seal/gasket replaced and a wheel bearing replaced after racking-up a whopping 4,500 miles.  Luckily the car was Certified Pre-owned, so actual out of pocket expenses have been next to nothing, other than time spent waiting at the dealership.  This is a great driving car, and it\\'s still under warranty for 16 more months, but dealership maintenance costs would be pushing $3000 after driving less than 5000 miles.  Love the look and feel of the car, but worried about long term ownership expenses. I finally got one! Having lusted over the A4 Avant for many years, my time has finally come!  I just picked up the last 05 (old style) Avant at my dealer\\'s on Dec 31. Light silver w ebony interior, Premium, Sport, Cold Weather & Sound pkgs.  A manual tranny would have been my preference, but I\\'m already getting spoiled w the auto.  It\\'s tighter in the back seat than my \\'02 Saab 9-5, but the build quality, steering, stereo w XM, and yes, the performance, are top-notch.  I can\\'t wait for my first road trip in this baby. In praise of the Audi A4 I love nearly everything about by 2005 Audi A4 Avant. Although I\\'ve only driven it 5000 miles so far, I haven\\'t had a single problem with it and the fun-to-drive factor is nearly off the scale. One quibble: I find the red numerals in the dash display hard to read. I\\'d vote for green instead. I\\'m averaging about 21 mpg around town -- not bad for a 255hp V-6. One caution: even in the Avant (wagon) version, cargo space is limited.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest) I give the Audi A4 Avant quattro 3.0 a 9.5. Amazing Luxury and Performance Wagon We compared wagons from Audi, BMW, Saab, Volvo, and Mercedes, and loved the modern design and understated luxury of the A4 Avant. We ordered a manual with just a few options (premium package, wood trim, and 17\" wheels).  I got it last week from after 3 months of waiting -- it was well worth the wait.  Photos do not really do the car justice. The big grill looks great in person, and the interior is simply the best in this class.  The most surprising experience is the unbelievable performance from a 2.0 liter engine.  Although the reliability of European cars was concerning, driving the Audi Avant puts a smile on my face that my past Hondas and Subarus never mustered.  Wife\\'s Ride Just bought the Audi 5 days ago so we just have a couple hundred miles experience with it.  We bought it to replace a 2002 Cadillac Escalade so this is a major change.  This will be my wife\\'s car but I will also drive it when I can get it away from her.  This Avant is a turbo 4 6 speed manual.  25+ mpg so far even around town.  Xenon lighting is fantastic.  Car was loaded with AM/FM CD changer Sirius satellite radio, 17\" wheel sports suspention, headlight washers, cold weather package, premium interior.  Great handling along with excellent fit and finish sold us on this vehical.  Hope we made the right desision. New 3.2 Rules I just replaced my 02 A6 2.7T with a loaded A4 3.2.  I got everything except the tire monitor and the rear parktronic.  I looked at the TL, G35, Lexus and just couldn\\'t leave the Audi family.  The build quality is so much better than the Japanese cars. Everything in the A4 is so tight.  I loved my A6 and had no problems in 41000 miles.   New 2.0T Engine is Fantastic! I\\'ve had this car for two weeks and love it more and more every day. The 2.0T FSI is just an amazing engine - far more powerful and smooth than the previous 1.8T. Even with the Avant/Quattro/Auto set-up, this car hauls butt! Good gas miliage too. This engine is a true revelation.  Audi upgraded the A4 suspension (S4 parts) and has finally matched bimmer in ride and handling. The rest of the car is beautifully built and feels solid as a rock. Audi interiors are, in MHO, the best in the industry. This car is tops in the entry lux/sport sedan catagory, and with Avant funtionality, it combines the best of sporty/SUV/compact attributes all into one catagory. Wonderful Car Delivered in flawless condition.  Routine maintainance only through 1st 10000 miles.  Quiet interior.  Manual transmission with 1.8 provides plenty of power.  Have bashed rear bumper hard a couple of times with virtually no damage. Constant Improvements My fifth Audi...solid, thoughtful in small touches, far more torque than expected. I am delighted. having owned an A6 and two allroads plus an S4 Avant, this car is a delight for much less money. Buy this Car Just passed the 1K milestone and everything in this car is better than anticiapted.  Great performance PLUS good fuel economy.  I absolutely love the navigation system, it\\'s the best I\\'ve ever seen.  In fact, I was reluctant to have the system but I was won over by the time I drove the car home fom the dealer.  The interior of the Audi is superb and very sport-driver friendly. What a nice upgrade! The new 2.0T is the perfect engine! The new body style is perfect, many new additions really make the 05.5 worth it. Great luxury sports sedan! This car has great performance for a 4- cyl. It handles really well in corners (and I have a non-sport suspension), rides well, and has a great interior. It won out over Acura TSX/TL, BMW 325&330 (though I was seriously considering the 330 w/performance package), Lexus IS300, and Infiniti G35. In terms of practicality, it has good trunk space & fold-down seats. Most importantly, it\\'s just an all-out fun car to drive--can\\'t wait to stretch its legs outside of the DC metro area! Awesome Car My new audi is 3 weeks old.  I tried just about every wagon on the market before buying this one.  It handles beautifully, and has terrific pick-up, and has had no problems thus far (1500 miles).   Hot Hot Hot This is a beautiful car.  I have had looks and compliments on this car the minute I drove if off the lot.  If you are a family guy/gal, with a sports car frame of mind, this wagon will amaze you.  Even the younger crowd appreciates the sporty looks of this \"family wagon\".  The BOSE sound system rocks too!!  For 40K, I would much rather be seen in an Audi than a Bimmer.  The transmission shifts effortlesly and the power in the 3.0 is naughty (great).  When you accelerate, this engine gives that low gurgley noise of a powerful engine.  One would think the Starship Enterprise is coming up behind them with the bi-xenon lights illuminated. Best Car I\\'ve Had This car overall is the best i\\'ve had. No problems yet and the performance is amazing. this car sucks dont buy it t t t t t t t t                               t    t               tttt                  t                       t                    tttt       t  ttt                 t t        t   t             t t     t t t t          t       t tt                     t   t                    tt         t      t  t t  t                       t t A4 Avant Bought to replace 1998 A4 1.8TQMS. New \\rcar has premium, sport, cold, Bose \\rpkgs.  New avant is slightly quicker, has\\rbetter highway mileage, but the same city \\rmileage as my previous car. It is very comfortable \\ron long drives.  The XM radio is \\rfabulous!  It feels somewhat larger than \\rthe old car and as a result it doesn\\'t handle quite as \\rwell.  That may be due to the all \\rseason tires rather than a proper \\rsummer sport tire. The ride is firm \\rwithout being harsh.  Its throttle action \\ris slightly jerky when released \\rsuddenly under hard acceleration.  There is no \\rreal turbo lag, but the turbo builds \\rpower early and holds it through the \\rrev range.  There is more leg room in the back \\rseat than my previous car had, but it still has less \\rthan my wife\\'s Passat. Babe Magnet After test driving BMW, Saab, and \\rAudi, I opted for the Audi.  The BMW \\rwas simple too expensive and Saab \\rinterior was bland.  The audi has the \\rperfect combo of exterior beauty and \\rinterior luxury.  Love it :) All Around Package My objective was to balance these \\rfactors with my car purchase: taxi the \\rkids to/from school, soccer, etc., good \\rfuel economy, ability to transport bike \\rinside, carry dogs, reasonable price, \\rand last but not least, FUN.  This car \\rso far meets all these criteria.  Like \\rmost reviews, I too want a bit more hp, \\rbut I plan to upgrade the ECU...should \\rdo the trick.  \\r This is one of the most intelligently \\rengineered cars I\\'ve seen, and coming \\rfrom 3 years of my Volvo s60, that\\'s \\rsaying alot.  Electronically, Audi has \\rput so much thought into providing \\rfeatures that make the car more useful \\rin every day driving.\\r Ride is ridiculous...very tight and \\rcontrolled yet comfy.  6 speed manual \\ris great Best in Class The Avant 3.0L with quattro and Tiptronic\\ris the best A4 and the best car in its\\rclass. Nice looking, top quality\\rmaterials powerful enough, excellent\\rhandling and enough trunk for a family \\rof three put this car in front of the\\rcompetition.\\rWith 3000 miles already on board the \\rshort term reliability is outstanding,\\rnot a single problem. Also, I have high\\rexpectations for the long term, will see.\\rFuel consumption is going down, probably\\rI have to wait 2000 miles more for the\\rfinal data, but now is 20city/30highway.\\r Very Happy Repair costs on the high side but my A4 has been very reliable and fun to drive! Awesome Car!!! Over all its a great car before buying one make sure you do your homework on the car. make sure the car was maintained well . I had a 98 Audi a very long time ago and had nothing but bad luck with it and it was the first Audi I ever owned. I never thought I would buy another one. But I found a 2005.5 Audi A4 Quattro 3.2 that caught my eye. It had all the service records with it since it was bought new and it ended up being a one owner car and all repairs was done at the Original Audi dealership that it came from. I lucked out there. The car handles so great it hugs the road and still looked like new. So I couldn\\'t pass it up . It was the best car purchase ive made in a long time  . Only one thing I had to repair these cars are known for glovebox hinge to break. Which was a easy fix . What a great car !! I have over 160K miles onmy Audi A4 AWD 2.0 turbo now & it runs as good as the day I bought it , maybe better as it is certainly broken in now .I have taken excellent care of this car at the dealer & it is a fantastic vehicle . Fast , smooth & reliable it was just driven 15 hrs back from NCarolina through the mountains in a blizzard with no issues or slippage at all -0- . Have new set of Blizzaks on this year for a terrible winter & the car just goes & goes , the only issue is ground clearance . Welp.. I purchase an early 05 B6 1.8 about six months ago with about 110k on it. I have put about 4K miles, $4K into it so far. As soon as I replace one thing it throws two new codes, pretty frustrating to say the least.I Love/Hate this car. Don\\'t buy one of these unless you can afford to fix it, or fix it yourself. At this point it should be good til 200K but I\\'m not convinced.-Brake switch-ECU- Coolant migrated through wiring into my computer and fried it.-Fan Module-Turbo - was bad, upgraded to K04& remapped software.-MAF sensor-Ignition Coils-Oil Level/Temp sensor-Thermostat-Engine speed sensor-Shift lock Solenoid is out now but will still shift out of park if you know the trick. $700 fuel pump Why did the fuel pump go bad after only 120,000 miles?The Acura we drive has 160,000 and the fuel pump is fine.$700 to replace it.$125 tow.I know it could be worse, but I think the reliability could be better.If you are doing all the required maintenance perfectly nothing should break. Take care of it, and it will take care of you! This is a great car!167000 miles and still going strong.Regular maintenace, tires, oil changes etc.Best car ever.... Does 2005 Audi A4 need a recall? At 70,000 miles, I had to replace the transmission. I\\'m now at about 85,000 miles and am being told the turbo is failing and that the cost to repair will be in the $2,000 range. If I make that repair, I will have spent about as much as the car is worth today on just two repairs. In doing some searches, it looks like to me that Audi has a transmission issue in these cars. (Haven\\'t seen the same complaints about the turbo, but I haven\\'t looked a lot either.) Sent Audi a letter about my issues and didn\\'t even get a reply. I now tell everyone who asks that I wouldn\\'t recommend an Audi unless you ONLY care how the car looks and drives (when it drives). Awful, awful, AWFUL! I have replaced: the crank shaft, the A/C compressor, the fuel injector pump, tires TWICE in 2.5 years (I\\'m a girl - I don\\'t ride this car hard at all), the air intake, headlights x 13 (there are an insane amount of headlights in this car).  I would have been better off (and happier) riding the bus. Amazing car I bought this car about 4 or 5 months ago, and i love it. For a V6 it seems far more powerful than a V6 on any other car. Not only does the engine feel powerful, but it sounds amazing, I always used to listen to the radio, but now generally leave it on a low volume so i can listen to the engine. The interior is not made for a 6-speed, as the armrest covers the cut hold and hand-break, so i would recommend an auto. I\\'ve had some problems with the headlight bulbs, which are decently costly, but that\\'s natural as I\\'m approaching 100k miles. I baby this car though, i clay and wax it several times a year, definitely feels like a show car that\\'s fun to drive! A4 has performance but costly repairs I love to drive this car. The performance is great the ride is like you are glued to the road even when traveling well over 100 miles per hour.The problem is when dealer warranty runs out and you only have extended the little constant repairs are very costly. The windows have a really bad problem with their regulators ($500/window) that I have had to replace on three windows. The trunk latch ($450) is a problem. Compressor went out ($1700). Timing belt is $1650 to replace. All of these things have been problematic for me and the car only has 79,000 miles at this point. I had a 2003 and it had all of the same problems, repairs, and the transmission went out in it costing $10,000. Just beware  Great Car, but it has its Highs and Lows I\\'ve owned my Audi A4 Ultrasport since 2006 when I bought it with 12K miles and it looked brand spanking new.  It now has 138K miles on it and a lot of story\\'s to tell. The car looks great, I get compliments on it all the time.  The car gets decent gas millage (22 combined, 28+ on road trips) and is fairly mechanically sound, but has had many little things go wrong with it which adds up to a great annoyance. The car is expensive to own especially if you want everything working properly and looking good, I was used to Honda\\'s before and the Germans clearly have a different outlook on vehicles. My take; Great car for the enthusiasts, not for your average commuter. Worst Car I have ever bought!!! The car was fine until the warranty ran out. I kept every service appointment with my car on time at only the Audi dealership and took excellent care of my car having it detailed each spring. Within a year of the warranty expiring my car would not start and at 62,000 miles and four years old my car needed a new $13,000 engine!!! The dealership told me they could not determine the cause and would not take care of any of the cost, which were more than the car was worth. They offered me nothing for a trade in and no deals on purchasing a new Audi, no financing. Audi does not stand by their cars or customers.  Really nice car with a few annoyances I leased the car, a 2005.5, for 3 years.  Very good handling + smooth ride combo.  Fairly quiet for a sporty car.  AWD is great, especially in foul weather. Better than my grand cherokee in snow Overall great vehicle, and I am happy with it.  No major problems, although minor annoyances have been an issue.  The paint job on the bumpers is horrible (but I attribute this to the dealership that sold me the car, not AUDI), and in the winter I have this annoying squeal that comes from the engine compartment (all the dealership will do is grease things down, which works for about a day).  Car is great in snow, an amazingly comfortable ride (I do not have the sport suspension), great fuel economy (33 mpg highway easy, although mpg suffers horribly in the cold months).  Some improvements can be made, but overall the car is great for me, an incredibly picky car person. Looks good, but... When I initially purchased the car in Jan 09 I was excited.  Now, Nov 09 I\\'m kicking myself for selling my Toyota.  Since I\\'ve owned it I\\'ve replaced ALL four ignition coils.  Two in one day once!  The passenger window regulator needs to be replaced and the A/C compressor is failing and leaking.  The gas mileage is dismal for a 4-cylinder engine.  I mostly commute on the freeway and only get about 22mpg on premium fuel.  The Quattro system is noisy as well. Still Love This Car... This is the best car I have owned; granted it is my first Audi.  After 4 years, I still love driving this car.  It has great pick-up, is excellent on snow (we also own a 4WD SUV and the AWD A4 is much better) and has been extremely reliable.  It still looks like new and I still get compliments on the look of it (I like the exterior design more than today\\'s model).  I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do when it\\'s time to replace it! Disappointed of Audi Loved my VW Golf build in Germany. My Audi, is a not a total disaster but fighting with Audi NA about quality issues. My headlights were a rain forest. Audi won\\'t fix nor address this issue. I did my own fix to it. If you buy an Audi, make sure you find an independent shop that works on your car for about 40% to 60% less than an Audi dealer otherwise your are paying too much. I will not buy an Audi again. It is a super fun car to drive in rain and snow. This is not comparable to any other cars I ever had. Also, make sure you grease the wiper transmission, this is also an Audi quality issue. Make sure you get a Certified Pre-owned (CPO) if you buy a used Audi. Nightmare Coils, electrical system, various gaskets. The engine light on our car has been on constantly since we bought it. We put a lot of miles on our cars and my sense is that the Audi models just aren\\'t built for the mileage. We bought extended warranty thankfully and our local dealership repair shop has been great to deal with, but sitting in the Audi repair shop is not my favorite pastime. We\\'ll never buy an Audi again. Ever. Audi is worth it My in-laws leased this car new and we bought out their lease after 3 years for a great price. I have owned 3 Hondas and a BMW 3 series previously, and this A4 is my favorite. Steering and handling are precise, AWD has been top notch in even heavy snow and the turbo 4-cyl provides plenty of power when you need it, but good fuel economy the rest of the time. My in- laws did have the transmission replaced under warranty, and I\\'ve had a coolant flange and a window regulator replaced under warranty. German cars can be like that, but the dealer/repair experience is first rate and makes up for the inconvenience. Both times I had the car back the same day. Cost/benefit is totally worth it. A great used car Bought this car used, a first for me.  It is the third Audi I have owned, the second A4.  A tremendous used value and more reliable than a BMW (I have had 3 of those, too).  Smooth ride, great ergonomics, extremely comfortable.  My only complaint is that the auto tranny has trouble finding 1st gear, it can be rough.  Other than that, a tremendous road car with great performance that I recommend highly. A Big Car In A Small Wrapper This review is on the 2005 3.0 A4 Quattro Sedan. I owned a previous generation A4 and this one blows it away. This B6 is larger in every way than the B5 model. I came out of a 03 Passat 4Motion into this and surprisingly the front and rear interior dimensions are almost identical. The only place you lose room in the A4 is the legroom in rear. (-2 inches) and the trunk. Hard to believe if you park them side by side. I think that is why this car is so fun to drive. It pushes the wheels to the edge of the car in each corner giving it great handling. The 3.0 has plenty of torque and acceleration while still avg. 23mpg w/ 50/50 hwy & city driving. Overall a great car and have had no issues An Awesome Automobile I was attracted to the Audi A4 as an entry level luxury sedan primarily because it is one of the few that offer all wheel drive. The BMW 325xi was my other option, but turned out to be more expensive. I really like the look of the A4. The ride is smooth, quiet and firm. No rattles or shakes. Fit and finish is top notch. The warranty is generous, includes free maintenance to 50K miles.The sound system is excellent. Overall I am very happy with it so far ( owned it for 6 months). Planning to boost the HP by reprogramming the ECU.  Great car Just bought this car used with 24,000 miles. So far it was exceeded my expectations. This is the first German car that I have owned, having owned a Jeep and Chevys previously. The maintenance package seems great, they found a coolant leak and fixed it along with replacing worn brake pads for free. Oil changes and most other basic services are included as well. My warranty does expire in Decemeber 08, and I have heard it\\'s wise to purchase an extended warranty. Being a single guy in Chicago, I rarely use the backseat, but if you have a family you may want to consider the A6 , due to lack of backseat and trunk space in this model.  Fun to drive but prone to breakdowns This is a very fun car to drive. It is easily equal to the 3 series BMW but you get more goodies on the base model. That said, be sure you can afford the maintenance this car requires.  I have already lost an A/C compressor, heater core, and both front window motors. After the A/C repair, my car blows barely cool air and never cold air. The heater core started leaking in the middle of winter. Everything has been covered under warranty but things don\\'t look good past that. This car is going to cost me plenty. Audi\\'s aweome! I never dreamed of owning an Audi because I have always driven American. But after seeing a few A4\\'s on the road I just had to have one. This is my first euro car and I think I am hooked! In terms of build quality and overall driving experience this is the car to drive. Steering is precise,  instrument gauges and center stack are top notch. For an 05\\' she doesnt look dated at all and is sexy as hell. Unsure yet of reliability since I just recently purchased her, but so far, so good.  Best Car I\\'ve ever owned I absolutely love this vehicle. I would recommend this car to anyone.  It has great acceleration for a factory stock car and the turbo kicks in almost seamlessly. The stereo is great.  I have the Audi Symphony one.   have only had minor setbacks such as interior map lights and window control light fail and the dealer fixed it no questions asked. Bumper to bumper warranty covers everything even the battery. Just recently replaced that.  Audi roadside assistance very helpful and fast. I Believe - Audi in BMW backyard I wanted to start driving a manual trans again, but could not find one that I really like with 4WD.  Then after the A4s that I test drove I settled for this one - black on black. The Audi A4 After 2 years driving, I\\'ve gotten a chance to reflect over the experience. First off, I would not buy an Audi. The A4 has shown me the entry level luxury field is somewhat of an oxymoron.  And the A4 is one of the better entries in this market.  The A4 is both luxurious as it is questionable in build.  Those looking into buying a quality product should settle with the japanese offerings.  At least then you would get a car that wouldn\\'t be in Audi\\'s wonderful service centers every week. 14 repairs in 2 years of ownership has kept me quite in the know about how cars work. The benefits of Audi products balance out some of the problems, but I would prefer driving my car daily, not a rental. Buyers Beware!! I\\'ve owned this car for 23 months and it\\'s been in the shop getting repaired for over 2 months.  Replaced the computer, fuel tank, burned out lights, coolant leaks, trunk latch broke, seat belt switch, fuel injectors leaking fuel everywhere.  I\\'m tired of driving a rental car around.  7 times in the shop for repairs, costing me several hundred dollars from missing time at work to deal with these problems. Don\\'t buy!!!! Pleasantly Surprised I\\'m very pleased with the Audi\\'s mix of performance and luxury.  Interior ergonomics and comfort are a step above the 3 series (which I test drove to compare).  The BMW\\'s 6 cylinder did not feel any more powerful that the Audi\\'s 4 cylinder turbo.  Plenty of safety features and additional comfort features to choose from.  No problems in the 21000 miles I\\'ve driven.      Gorgeous One of the most beautiful cars around. The interior is first class. The Special edition adds more fun to the driving experience, though a little stiff on bumpy roads. The only con is performance. The engine could use a little more power. Overall, a car that turns heads and gets lots of ohhh!! inside and out; but don\\'t challenge other cars for a quick race... you\\'ll be left eating dust. Great car This car is really great and I would recommend it to anyone. It has great acceleration. I love merging onto the highway beacuse I can always get in. It\\'s really fun to drive and gets pretty decent gas mileage.  It\\'s pretty decent for the price The car is a pretty good car, but if it didn\\'t have maintenance and a really good warranty I would have gone broke by now. The A4 after 2000 miles started having problems with the engine, then around 15000 miles the windows on the car would not go up or down and so was the sunroof which was stuck during the rainy season in california. At around 22000 miles the car\\'s transmission light started going off and on, went to the dealership to only find out the transmission module had broken. But thanks to the warranty it was covered or would have cost me over 6000 dollars to replace, but I had no car for over a month. Real Fun to drive Great engine, smooth trans & handle keep me being excited. Too much similarity with new Jetta Love my audi It reminds me a lot of the 1980 VW Scirocco with 14 pound callaway turbo I had in high school.  It\\'s amazingly fun to drive and handles great for the price.  I highly recommend it. The most fun Luxury Entry Sports Sedan Having driven all of the competitors, the Audi A4 2.0T Quattro was by far my easiest choice to date. Awesome driving dynamics and comfort combined make it the most fun to drive. She\\'s been through 100 Mph, 100 mile non-stop drives at 107F and a 70 Mph drive through a raging mid-west blizzard -- couldn\\'t tell the difference. Combine this with top-notch reliability -- never had a single issue with her in a year now.  Wolf in Sheep\\'s Clothing I am a 6-month owner of the 2005.5 A4 2.0T, and this car is a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing. The only complaint about this car is the low level of torque under 2K RPMs ... after that, watch out!! The ride is like silk at 80MPH. The paint job is one of the best I have ever seen. The attention to building detail makes my former Volvo look embarassing. You notice the small things on detail over time (like the hangers in the trunk for groceries packed in plastic bags and the A4 manual compartment under the steering wheel, to keep you glove box empty and ready for anything you want. Finally, I just began to really use the triptonic manual shift and it is a hoot! You are in complete control of the car! A good performer We\\'ve had this car for about a year now and it\\'s growing on me. I wasn\\'t crazy about the car at first because the gas mileage was so terrible for a 4 cylinder. The car is very solid and I feel very safe in it. The AWD is awesome. It\\'s my first car with AWD and I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go back. This car is amazing at high speeds, in the snow, rain, etc. Handles like it\\'s on rails, doesn\\'t sway, very stable, no rattles, etc. It handles better than my C5 Vette. 4 cyl, turbo is ample. Has more pick me up in the sport mode on the shifter. We just test drove a new 06 Lexus ES250 AWD and the Audi drives and handles better. It made me appreciate the Audi more.  WOW For anyone looking for affordable, fun, upper end car. The audi A4 is the car, I was shopping for german car with lots bells on it and the A4 was the car for me. I am a big Honda and I traded my Honda v6 for the A4, I felt that Audi is the higher end of a honda that will last you and run for ever and you pay for what you get. I could have gotten a bmw if I wanted to pay for all the standard options on that already came on the Audi. My next car will be the new A6. Amazing machine I purchased my Audi A4 2.0T fully loaded back in June of 2005, the car is stunning, the engine, even though it is the base engine, is beautiful to drive in sport mode, the interior materials are the best I have seen compared to friends who have BMWs and Mercedes C classes, gas is a bit costly if you drive fast and long trips like i do but well worth it, the sound system is also the best within the other german sedans, this car is definitely worth its price. Excellent Audi This is a truly splendid car to drive. The turbo-lag takes a while to get used to, but it has ample power and torque. The build quality, interior design and instrumentation are superb.The road-holding is very good: a firm, sure-footed ride. The backup (I have had one minor problem) has been exemplary. I strongly recommend the Audi. It might not have the \\'glitz\\' appeal of the BMW, but it make up for it with its \\'solidness\\'. Remember to compare this particular model with the BMW 320i or with the Mercedes C200 - not with the BMW 230i or Mercedes C240.  the key to Audi Lovely car, excellent to drive good to own and the residuals are great. its my third new one in three years, but they have got to sort out the key fobs. they keep on failing and are driving me batty. Paul Class wears a sport coat Having owned the A4 now for just over a year, I thought it was time to give my impressions.  If you are looking for a red light racer, keep looking.  If you want a car that handles VERY well, accelerates good enough, but does so with a classy, polished feel, then this is a car you should check out.  The sport package gives the A4 a flat, smooth ride, balanced handling, and good cornering.  The AWD and ESP provides the driver with confidence in snowy, slushy, and icy conditions.  I average 33 mpg highway (at 70mph)/23 city stop and go.  Interior is superb with everything right where you want it.  If you are looking at BMW 3 series, Acura TL/TSX, or Infinity G35\\'s, give the A4 a look, too. Good choice I checked out and drove a Saab 9-3, Acura RL, and Volvo S 40 and 60 before settling on the A4. The 2.0 T and the new transmission work together for power and excellent gas mileage (the EPA projections are pretty darn close to right so far.) The quattro drive was probably the tipper over the other cars, providing more stability in the curves. If I had a few more available bucks, I would have definitely gone with the convertible version. Good for city and road.  Don\\'t trust Audi warranty There is no doubt that the A4 has been fun to drive and the Quattro\\'s performance is unmatched.  But after driving the car for 2+ years it has become very loose with all kinds of interior/exterior noises.  My brakes\\' rotors are already warped and Audi service and Customer care are telling me that it is not covered under warranty because of \"outside influences stemming from overheating caused by riding on the brakes and braking too hard\".  This seems like a lame excuse not to cover damage to brakes caused by normal driving. Love it....BUT.... I have driven this car for 11 months now.  There are some drawbacks that I can live with (cup holders, seat control location, awkward reverse gear) since the drive is really nice.  The cup holders are almost useless.  The seat controls on the drivers side can easily be activated by accident while exiting the car.  The reverse is a push-stick-down and forward left which is the same direction as first gear.  Guess I am just used to the right-and-back reverse on every other car I have owned. Great little car I purchased this car about 2 months ago for my wife and I have to say she LOVES it.  I can\\'t get her out of it, she has put 4000 miles on the car in a month. I have driven it 5 time since we\\'ve had it.  I was not sure about buying a 4-cyl car, after having a 6- cyl 2003 Maxima with 255 hp but the Audi\\'s performaces is very suprising for a 4-cyl car and the Quattro AWD system is awesome in bad weather.  I can\\'t wait for it to snow, so I can really have some fun.  I recommend this car for anyone who wants a sport sedan. Nice but missing some perks We traded in our bmw 328i for this car so we wouldnt be sliding in the snow for another winter.  good idea - this baby is great in the snow.  car looks beautiful and has a fairly sleek ride.  (We bought and service our car at Bell Audi, they are the best.  We took the car home the same day we saw it and the service people are great!) I\\'m Very Happy This car has awesome handling and power.  I\\'m glad I didn\\'t get the BMW.  There is a very slight rattle in the sunroof, but otherwise very well put together. A classy car, magnificent ride! An excellent, wonderfully well-made car.The interior finish is magnificent. The roadholding is superb, with a solid firm ride and and excellent directional stability. One feels as if traveling in a mobile fortress! The braking is outstanding and rear-view vision superb. The engine is powerful enough, though the upgrade to the new 2.0 litre FSI Turbo will give that extra punch at lower revs that one feels the need for at times. This is a car for those who need to travel long distances. It begs to be driven on freeways! Not that good for small suburban shopping trips, though! Thumbs up!  Peppy Nice car.  Less expensive than the BMW 3, more refined than the Acura TL, and nicer features than both.  I sold a 97\\' E320 Benz to get this car, and the 2.0T in the A4 is just as powerful as the Benz V6, and the Turbo is great.  Never thought I would drive another 4 banger, but this one is nice!  The design inside and out is a bit boring, but the fun to drive factor is high.  I drove everything competitive, and this was the best value.   Everything has been fixed I had a terrific time with my very fun 2001 A4 1.8T FWD sedan.  Thought I would hate to give it up, but this one is so good I\\'ve gotten over my previous love quickly.  Everything I disliked about the old model has been redesigned for the better and nothing has been made worse.  Cupholders actually work.  Cargo net actually works.  No bottom \"spoiler thing\" under the front bumper to help the bumper rip off on those parking lot curbs (yes, I ripped the old one off).  Turbo lag has been greatly reduced and power is there at lower tach.  Cruise control is actually easy to use.  Plus, lots more cool gadgets and handy storage spaces.  No real complaints about anything so far.  What a car The Audi A4 3.2 quattro is simply a great car.  Mucho power, amazing handling -- this car feels like a \"baby\" S4....with double the fuel economy.  The 2.0T engine has gotten a lot of praise but the naturally aspirated 255HP 3.2 V6 is smoother, more refined, in all ways a better feeling engine than the 200HP 4 cylinder 2.0T.  Test drive both and you will see what I am talking about.  I drove the 2.0T first and liked it, then I drove the 3.2 and had to have it.  The engine note is gorgeous when you get on it in gears 2-4, very exotic sounding.  The new 6-speed tiptronic is head and shoulders above Audi\\'s previous 5-speed tips.  In \"S\" mode this car really feels and acts quick. Alright... My experience so far has been a negative one. One month with the car and an engine belt breaks off meaning 2 weeks of labor. An extra two months into the car and the left tail light went off. Lately, the Airbag sign came on. Not to mention that the ignition key battery is already dead.   Greater Than Following I bought my A4 after test driving the BMW 3 series and Lexus IS. Of the three of them, I settled on the Audi because it had better handling than the Lexus and better styling than the BMW. I have never regretted it. Although it\\'s a gas hog (it\\'s thirsty), it is a total blast to drive. The acceleration is smooth and quick for a 4 cyl. and it hugs every single curve on the road. I\\'m not thrilled with the red lit interior, but it feels more luxurious than the BMW by far. I haven\\'t had anything go wrong with it in the 4 months I have owned it (and driven it HEAVILY). Bottom line is that its a great car all around - not just for the price.  Will never drive ANYTHING but an Audi... I have driven many different cars and I will never again own or drive anything but an Audi.  From the excellent service to the amount of pure fun it is to drive, Audi is by far in a class all its own.  Lookout BMW and MB!!!! Best Car I\\'ve Ever Owned! This car is loaded with so many options! I got Dolphin grey, Ebony interior, Premium package, lighting package, sport package, audio package. It is so much fun to drive and the gas mileage is amazing for the amount of horsepower the car has. The fit and finish is beyond my expectations! A Bargain at this price A great car, powerful, plush, fun to drive and a relative bargain compared to the BMW 325xi it replaced. A great blend of performance, luxury, technology and rock steady handling. Best thing is that it doesn\\'t seem to be afected by weather or road conditions as it drives the same in bad weather, bad roads or any conbination of the two. Understated looks but stands out since nothing else looks like it. I love this car. Great Car I now have three months of experience with this car and find no faults. Interior is great. Exterior is great. Mechanicals and dynamics are outstanding. Bose and XM sattelite sound system is excellent. Zero defects at delivery. High gas mileage on my one long trip - nearly 30mpg at 75-80mph. Welcome step up from a 2001.5 GLX, 5MT VW Passat that I thought was going to be hard to beat. Great All Around Sedan Went with the Ultrasport model in Brilliant Red.  The paint along with the quality of materials is flawless.  18\" wheels, bodykit, and performance suspension are great.  Car not as fast as an S4 but it handles great and gets excellent gas mileage. Interior is perfect. a411 I do not regret rejecting the new BMW 3-series. Can Audi build a car that is TOO good? The answer is YES! I ordered my Audi A4 2.0T Quattro sedan on 11/26/04 (arrived on 2/28/05). I ordered mine loaded with Navigation, Bose w/ Sirius Radio, 6-speed manual w/Sport, Cold Weather, Lighting, & Sunshade Pkgs. I opted against Tire Pressure Monitoring (pain in the butt)! I waited a long time for this car, but it has EXCEEDED my expectations. I have been told I have a permanent grin when behind the wheel! Everything the 1.8T lacked in interior equipment, engine power, and looks has been addressed in it\\'s redesign. I get 31 mpg hwy, 27 city! I drove the BMW 3-series AWD in the snow, and found myself going down down my hill sideways. The Audi Quattro reigns supreme!  All weather sports sedan Have had the car for 4 weeks - considered BMW325X, Infinity G35X and Accura TL.  Car has sports pkg, Premium, and Lighting package.  Great in good and poor weather, fabulous in snow.  Styling is superb - no regrets - could use a little more hp. but is what I expected,- Sport mode shifter, and tiptronic makes up for this -  handling exceeds my capabilities and nerves.  Gas mileage is great. Roomier than BMW 325 (2005.  Styling is better than the 2006. Unsafe at (Low) Speed? Odo @ 9,730 mis. when I \"subleased\" car from friend, who reports repeat instances of exiting hiway where engine revs too high while attempting to decelerate. My 1st day with it became keenly aware of major safety issue: posts at 4 corners of the cabin are too WIDE. Impact on field of vision most pronounced at low speeds as it takes longer for blind spots to clear, esp. if object is moving in same direction as spot: while driving <6 mph in grocery lot (turning R after stop) I almost ran into LARGE pedestrian who, though I had looked R- L-R, was invisible until I was facing him, and when leaving almost tagged a woman and the baby stroller she was pushing! Reliable, Safe, Fun to Drive The quality of the this car is amazing.   I like the design much better than the new 2.0 model.  Acceleration is excellent.  I considered the A4 and the TSX.  The TSX feels like a car for children, while the A4 feels like a car for professional adults.  Got the 1.8 with FrontTrak, which seemed more peppy than with Quattro.  Also, the FrontTrak model gets really good gas mileage.  I get up to 39 mpg on Hwy 101 during rush hour traffic.  Purchased my car from Rector Audit in Burlingame.  The sales staff was very professional and not like your typical car dealership.  Projector headlights are fine - you don\\'t need xenon.  Standard stereo works great. Love it! We had a 2001 A4, 2.8 Quattro before we purchased our new 2005 Audi A4 2.0T quattro Sedan.  Any problem that we had with our previous car was repaired under warranty. We were most pleased with the trouble free ownership experience, so we purchased another.  It is absolutely rich and elegant looking. We\\'re not sure about the reliability of the \\'05 model yet, but are very proud owners.   A Superb Package... The new Audi A4 2.0T quattro is a big improvement over the 1.8T.  The engine is very strong and has a lot of low-end torque. It is very quiet.  It feels like the old A6 in ride quality and roominess. It has comfort, economy, typical Audi fit and finish. The tiptronic transmission in Sport mode allows the engine to redline, and it is surprisingly fast. This car is extremely comfortable, has good fuel economy, quattro, big brakes and is great looking....it is the best A4 yet. Sporty but practical - and fun! I\\'ve been pleasantly surprised at the performance characteristics of our new 2005 A4, purchased in December 2004.  It has quite a lot of pep, a smooth transmission, and it really hugs the road.  It has a quiet, very comfortable ride.  The ride is surprisingly comparable to our BMW 330ci.... but with that Quattro AWD, it\\'s a lot more practical in the snow!   great car for the money I bought this car with the premium package and 17\" wheels. The car drives like it is on rails. I also have the cold weather package it makes life a lot happier on long drives and cold days.The quality of this car is better than any car I have ever owned and I have owned my fare share of them. Do not be scared off by the bad reviews this car is well built, like I said I have owned many cars and some of them had many problems too. The power of the 1.8t is fun enough to get you into trouble with the police but the bottom end could use more oomph. Over all a very well made fun to drive car. Best Car I\\'ve Ever Bought! Better then.. This car out performs ever other car I\\'ve owned, even my last car, a Mercedes Benz 430 CLK.  It is equipped with Audi\\'s infamous Sport Package so the car handles beautifully. The interior looks and feels very high quality and the controls are strategically placed and user friendly. The power is sufficient, and more than adequate past 2500 RPM\\x92s, but that also translates to an average MPG of 34 on my daily highway commute. Just set the cruise to 65 MPH and what your trip computer.  A great car despite what some have said. B7 2005.5 , 2.0 Quattro  About 700 miles so far and this car is winning me over. Had a 2001.5 Passat GLX, 5 speed. Close family cousin but this Audi is far nicer. The 2.0 turbo has lots of torque and is much improved from the old 1.8. The 6 speed manual is very good. Leather is a step up from the VW. Bose/XM combination is the best sound I\\'ve ever heard in a car. Gas mileage is as good as or better than my Passat was. Still discovering hidden features - DRL button. No problems detected yet - no shakes, rattles, electronic glitches. Dealer left tires way over inflated - be sure to check them   Fun to Drive but Problems My 2005 Audi A4 1.8T quattro is really fast and fun to drive. The exterior looks great. The audio system is awesome. Its interior design could be better though, the cup holders are in weird places and don\\'t work well. You can easily spill coffee because they don\\'t hold the cups. All cars come with ashtrays, which we could do without. Our biggest issue is that after only two months of owning the car, the airbag light is on.  My Audi dealership\\'s customer service was rude on the phone.  She said she was doing us a \"favor\" by letting us bring the car in today, and we\\'d have to WAIT for the car, no loaner.  Give me a break!  This is an expensive car and it is only two months old. That was a big disappointment because we really like the car. Too Fun! My 2005 Audi A4 1.8T is fantastic! I drove everything from a BMW 330, Acura TL, Infiniti G35, Volvo S60, and Saab 9-3 before settling on the Audi.  It\\'s the perfect blend of performance, luxury, and comfort.    Audi-A4 Quattro Very reliable in little snow fall. Handles well in small spaces and on turns. Looks very nice! Love My Audi A4 Great Car! I test drove the Audi A4 and \\rInfiniti G35. The G35 was nice, but the A4 was a \\rstandout! I chose the Sport package \\rwith Sirius Radio Installation. \\rThe handling and interior are outstanding. \\rIt has excellent gas mileage for the thrifty \\rconsumer. Have had the car for two \\rmonths with no problems. It is truly a \\rpleasure to drive everyday! The best girl car out there  i just received my first car and after test driving, literally, 15 cars, this was the only car i wanted. its compact, fast, fuel efficient, it is awd and great in the snow, and most of all it is adorable. i would not have picked any other car. this is a great car for someone my age and i am so happy for it. Thanks Mom EPA Mileage is way off! We had a 98 A4 prior to this one and I think I like that one better. This car is very stylish and has a classy interior. To me, it feels like a $50,000 car. Real solid. However, I can\\'t stand the center console. It\\'s positioned so that my leg room is restricted and makes driving almost a miserable experience. I thought I can get over it but so far with 1,100 miles, I hate it. Way to uncomfortable. Gas mileage is horrible. My other Audi was incredible with MPG but this one is worse than a SUV. Seriously. It\\'s very disappointing. I\\'m taking it to the dealer soon but Audi has never been famous for their customer service. LEASE these cars only and give them back before the warranty expires! Love to drive Now in my 4th month, w/o significant problems so far, looking for every excuse to drive it. I grew up in Germany and this car is built for the Autobahn. I cannot imagine a safer car in the New England winter. I don\\'t understand why some call it \"underpowered\" in a country with such ridiculous speed limits. Why do you need <8.0 seconds for 0-60 if the speed limit is 65 MPH !?!?!  Safety first I feel very safe in my Audi A4 3.0. Not living up to expectations I have to admit, when I purchased the \\rA4 it was my first car over $30,000.  Over \\r$35,000 really.  But I needed 4 doors, \\rneeded 4WD and was tired of the SUV \\rride.  After six months, the build \\rquality of this car is absolutely \\rterrible.  I am totally surprised that \\rsources like Edmunds keep recommending \\rthis car (and VWs).  Its my fault, if I \\rhad read half of the discussion groups \\retc. before I bought, I never would have \\rtouched it.  The last time I took it in \\rfor the 3rd injector replacement, all \\r12 bays had newer Audis in them.  This \\ris also a Porshe and Subaru dealer.  When \\rI mentioned it to the service manager, \\rhe just shook his head and said \\rexhausted, \"You have no idea!\" 2004.5 Ultrasport better than a Benz! When I first saw the Silver 2004.5 Audi\\rA4 with the Ultrasport package, I said\\rto myself, I got to have it!!  So, I\\rsold my 1994 Mercedes Benz CLK320 and\\rgot bought one of the first A4\\rUltrasport in the SF Bay area.  I love\\rthe exterior look (especially after Audi\\rFINALLY decided to paint the lower body\\rpanels) and the interior quality.  \\r The ride is a little stiff and the power\\rcould be more.  But, nothing that\\rcouldn\\'t be fixed with lowering the tire\\rpressure and chipping the ECU (i.e.\\rreprogramming the engine computer for\\rmore turbo boost).  I got the APR\\rDirect-port programming for 209hp and\\r236lb-ft torque!!\\r Summary: After chipping, the car is perfect! Take Warning This car is worthless.  The electrical  look elsewhere I loved this car for it\\'s exterior  Don\\'t Be Fooled A4 Smokes Them All I test drove A4, TSX, S40 & 3-Series.  \\rTSX is cheap and slow...peices coming \\roff demo. S40 is fast, but unrefined \\rand noisy at speed. The 3-Series is \\rOVERPRICED.  My A4 is a 1.8t 5-Speed w/ \\rBOSE, Premium Package & Sports \\rPackage.  The interior is outstanding \\rcompared to everything else.  The \\rengine w/out Quattro makes the car \\rREALLY fun to drive & fast.  I also \\rhave averaged 33.5MPG...outstanding! \\rOverall I love my new car.  I am very \\rhappy I didn\\'t get anything else I \\rdrove. The A4 is fun, reliable (I had \\ra \\'99 A4 before & no problems over 6 \\ryears)and the insurance was the \\rlowest..wow.  You can\\'t go wrong if you \\rare looking at the A4. A4 1.8t 5-Speed M W/ Ultra-Sports Pack. This car delivers with the Ultra-Sports \\rpackage.  The 170hp engine has just \\renough power.  I had a \\'99 A4 before \\rthis and it had 150hp and the 20 hp, \\respecially with the manual, is \\rnoticeably more powerful.  I had 16 \\rinch wheels with a sports package on my \\rold A4 and this new A4 with the Ultra-\\rSports package rides a lot better than \\rmy old A4 ever did, and my new one has \\r18 inch wheels with 40 series \\rtires!!!!  Great job on the suspension \\rguys!  I just love this car.  Yeah, it \\rcould use the Acura TSX\\'s engine, but I \\rhave enough fun in my A4 without \\rgetting arrested.  I highly recommend \\ran Audi. They get a bad rap on \\rreliability.  I had my \\'99 6 years and \\r100k miles.  I had no major problems. A fun car to drive... I\\'ve had this car for the past month \\rand I love every drive I take. The CVT \\rtransmission is so smooth it\\'s a little \\rdisconcerting at first. The sport mode \\ris a much peppier ride and the 6 speed \\rtiptronic is smooth and powerful. \\rExcellent trunk space with neat extra \\rfeatures such as cargo-net hold-downs. \\rThe Premium Package really rounds out \\rthe comfort with leather seats and \\rpower sunroof. The stock sound system \\ris plenty powerful and sounds great, \\rwith another nice feature; when you \\rturn on the system it can default to a \\rpreset volume, so you\\'ll never be \\rblasted out of your seat from playing \\rloud music on the way home from the \\rnight before... Love it I love my Audi. I bought a demo...and  Sweet 2005 ultrasport package This is my first Audi and I chose it \\rover the 325xi, c-class, acura TL.  \\rAWD is amazing and the turbo gives \\rplenty of torque and power, however \\ranother 30-40 hp would be better.  \\rInterior was the best out of the cars \\rI test drove.  Only had car for 2 \\rweeks, hopefully no problems down the \\rroad.  This car gets double takes all \\rthe time.  Ultrasport package is a \\rmust if you are really into looks and \\rtighter suspension. Best Car Ever! With one exception, a 1966 Oldsmobile Cutlass,  I\\'ve driven cars with manual transmissions since 1962. starting with a four on the floor Corvair Monza. I\\'ve had a Volvo, Hondas, Acuras and for many recent years, a successions of SAABs until they disappeared from the market. Seeking the best replacement, I found the 2012 A4 the closest to my beloved SAABs. With manual transmission available in all lines, not just the bottom feeder. the A4 turned out to be a great alternative. Now I have a new 2018 A4 Premium Plus in the gorgeous Matador Red color, light beige seating, with the only option being the wood inlay trim. It is a car that exudes class inside and out. It is by far the best handling and performing car I have ever owned. And the standard Bang & Olufsen sound system is glorious. From a value perspective, Audi beats BMW and Mercedes because the standard equipment on the Premium Plus model would add substantially to the cost of those cars. The strong, silent type The ride is supple yet not fatiguing. You feel the road but it does not affect comfort. You hear almost no road noise and can have a conversation at normal voice inside. Acceleration is brisk and satisfying. Though using premium 91 octane fuel, the payoff is great mileage if you allow the automatic stop start feature and coast to stops. Interior seating comfort is excellent and the driver\\'s seat can be dialed in perfectly. Controls are easy to use, the display large enough to read, and the connectivity for iPhones and Android phones makes it easy to enjoy multiple information sources. LOVE AUDI A very fun car to drive, exterior looks much greater than any brand of German cars!! A Solid Mid-Size Fun Car. I feel safe in the driving of this sedan. I have driven 2 door coupes all my life, this first sedan feels as sporty, handles as well and performs beautifully. Has great acceleration , relatively solid and stable even thought it is nor s heavy as the pervious German coupes I have driven. I have the Black Optic package with high gloss exterior accent, 20in. titanium wheels and tires along  with the Sport package for a dynamic stability.  This is a beautiful luxury car and the best for the value. Very impressive technology This car is extremely fuel efficient in the Ultra model, the high style Bauhaus design is compelling , and the interior is the most quiet out there except for a Rolls Royce or Bentley Audi A4 Quattro makes me feel younger! My previous car was a BMW 528i and it felt great.  However, once I drove the A4 I could feel the difference in handling and traction/stability on the road.  I am having more fun in this car and it has all the bells and whistles too!  At 71 I think I deserve a zippy car for a change. Best German Entry Lux Sedan of 2018 Before you drop your spare change on any other car in this class, you owe it to yourself to test drive this one. I was shopping for a C300 with my wife. I was so impressed with this I had to buy one for myself. Great Audi from a former beamer Buy from reputable dealer 3rd A4 in a row, this one better than ever! Best car I\\'ve ever owned, hands down. I am a 3 time A4 owner and love the significant improvements they\\'ve made in the 2018. Sport Package and Black Optics set off the look and the front sport seats grip my body in spirited driving. Dynamic blend of performance and luxury. 100% would buy again A4 Sport Line I\\'ve driven A4s for over 15 years. I\\'ll be fair but I have always loved them :) New Owner Have now owned the car for 7 months and went in with high expectations. Happy to say they have all been exceeded. Great drive, excellent handling, great technology. Exceeded all expectations. Just keeps getting better! Great but not BMW great I loved the A4 but the BMW 330i won with me.  More fun to drive (BMW is the ultimate driving machine). BMW had a much better sales team too. Audi leads the way 2018 improvements make the purchase of the new A4 a solid investment that will provide enjoyment and a sense of pride for years to come.  We recently replaced our 2009 A4 with 121,000 trouble free miles with a new 2018 A4 Premium Plus Quattro. Both cars are from AudiTampa purchased and serviced there. Fun sedan The all new Audi A4 sure is a fun sedan to drive Little \\'ole lady from Prescott $ for $, you get a much better value by purchasing a sedan (like this one) over a SUV. High performance Audi A4 Quattro S tronic What an unbelievable sports car. Handling is superb. The fold-down split seats are a big plus for extra storage. Rides like a luxury car and performs like a race car. Excellent mileage due to the well designed engine. I love this car! Passing every Prius The A4 is an absolute joy to drive!  It is agile, quick, sexy and also elegant...with an attitude.  The summer tires are sticky and you can feel the car hugging the road on high speed turns.  Every stop light becomes a starting line and I cannot resist passing every Prius I see.  Handles beautifully in any kind of weather, in traffic and the on the open road.  The B&O speakers transform my commute into a concert (although my hearing is suffering! LOL).   Unfortunately, shortly after I leased this car, I got a new job 70 miles from my home.  My only regret is the mileage that I am putting on this beautiful car, however, now that I have experienced driving it, I could never settle for anything less. Beautiful Look, disappointing driving experience If you ever had a lexus, then you wouldn’t call this car luxury as the company and dealers say. In the first year I had to take the car for service 4 times, every time for a new problem. Cheap quality of parts, using so much cheap plastic in the interrior design, and not powerful transmission are just a bit of my dissatisfaction. A4 ultra. A great commuter car I test drive the A4 Quattro, and my A4 ultra. I have to admit the Quattro may be faster, but I am a commuter. The ultra is exactly the same as the interior, cheaper,  and the same reliability and guaranty than the Quattro. Also excellent millage, 33 to 35 miles to the gallon and super stable. Thus, if you are a commuter the ultra is OUTSTANDING. A great experience, only that the car is slower in acceleration for 2 seconds. NO ONE (without tickets) speed up like that. Thus, I am extremely happy. BMW gal goes Audi and is not disappointed! After 10 plus years driving BMW, I decided to look at some other options mainly because I wanted to try something different. After being an avid Audi hater for years I reluctantly went to look at the A4 because a family friend worked there and I could potentially get a great deal. Let me tell you, WOW! I was sold instantly after only sitting in the car. Audi has stepped up their game on the vehicles interior and in my opinion has completely SHAT on BMW\\'s interior look. Fast forward to driving this car.. again WOW! In my 328 i felt every pot hole etc as I drove. Driving the A4 is the smoothest, quietest experience I have ever had in a car. The only complaint I have and its a small one is that the gas pedal is slightly slow to react but its barely noticeable. Overall, the Audi A4 is has far surpassed my expectations. If you make the switch from BMW, you will not be disappointed. Too much technology You need a PhD to drive this car.  The manual is difficult to read so if you have a button, good luck finding it in the manual.  It has a control panel that is complicated to find the entry you need.  So for example, to program the garage door opener, you need to go through about 5 steps which are not intuitive and difficult to find.  The volume on my GPS suddenly disappeared.  It took me days of fooling with the manual to figure out how to get it back on and I still don\\'t understand how it disappeared.  I had the windshield repaired and the technician moved the steering wheel.  It took me a week to figure out how to move the steering wheel.  There is little foot room in the rear seats.  The \"leather\"  seats are cheap looking.  The Audi dealer gave me a 10 minute training session when I bought the car which didn\\'t help matters.  You can blame this on a female, but my husband has had no more luck than I in figuring out this car.   I am really disappointed in this car. Don\\'t even think to get it!! Very poor Technology they lie to you saying this MMI bull...... Don\\'t buy that. IF you have a flat tire the car is not even able to show you that. Imagine the rest... Audi loses a customer for $300... I drive a 2017 Audi A4.  Recently, the programmable radio buttons and MMI began to malfunction.  I brought it in for service expecting a repair under warranty and was told that the problem was “likely” due to liquids spilling onto the buttons, not covered by the warranty.  I would tend to agree with this diagnosis BECAUSE the radio buttons are positioned directly next to the cup holders.  It is almost impossible to avoid spilling liquid into the buttons because of this design.  Even the motion of the car with a cup of liquid in the holder could easily cause liquid to spill into the radio buttons.  Nevertheless, this is clearly a design flaw with the center console.  I have been a computer engineer since 1983 therefore my ability to recognize a user interface design issue is my business.  But it doesn’t take an engineer to recognize the poor design of the center console.  I contacted Audi customer support AudiCustomerExperienceCenter@audi.com and after waiting almost two months, the customer service rep never bothered to provide a final response.  Instead, I had to escalate, searching the internet for another way to contact Audi, who agreed to cover only the parts ($600) but not the labor costs ($300).  I did not accept this offer because the design of the center console is the cause of this issue because it’s inevitable that liquid will spill into the radio buttons given that they are positioned right next to the cup holder.  So there you have it.  Audi has decided to lose a customer for $300 over what in my opinion and experience is a design flaw.  This is my second A4.  The cup holder of the 2012 A4 was NOT positioned next to the radio buttons.  In 2017 Audi changed the console and created this problem. Don’t buy an AUDI !!! These are nice looking cars but don’t be fooled that’s the end of the benefit.  Our Audi had a complete engine failure and heard from MANY people that had frequent expensive repairs.  I’m so disappointed with these cars. What an awful experience! New Audi Owner and Loving It I traded in my 2007 BMW 335i, which I owned for 7 years and had a blast driving.  However, it was a money pit since it was out of warranty and breaking down more and more frequently.  I went car shopping and looked at the new BMW 330s, Infiniti Q50s, and Lexus IS 300s.  Then I test drove the Audi A4 and the search was over.  It had everything I was looking for: AWD, fun to drive with plenty of power, good gas mileage, great looks, and the best technology in its class.  Others may have more have more power on paper, but this car feels just as fast if not faster.  Excellent value for the money...highly recommend a test drive if you\\'re car searching. All for the A4! I previewed many of the luxury sedans in this segment: Mercedes C300 4Matic, Lexus IS AWD, BMW 330i X-Drive and Acura TLC A-Spec w/Super Handling AWD. The value proposition on the Audi surpassed the others. Living in the N.E. AWD is a must, so the Quattro option Premium Plus was the best deal for me. The fit and finish is excellent. Yes, the exterior may be a bit conservative compared to the others in the segment - but it\\'s classy without being gaudy. The interior is a technical marvel. The Virtual Cockpit has to be seen to be believed, none of the competitors can match Audi\\'s current tech and Google Earth maps. Apple Car Play works seamlessly and the MMI system is fairly intuitive. With the exception of the Acura, the rival cars get pricey when you add the tech and safety features already in the Premium Plus version of the Audi A4. The ride and handling is very good, granted the BMW still shines in this area - but their tech is somewhat dated. In addition, the A4 cabin is very quiet and inviting. The 19 speaker Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system is remarkable, it sounds like your virtually in a live concert. The Acura A-Spec is the probably the best value proposition and has more horses but lacks the refinement of the Audi and Acura\\'s duel screen infotainment system seems dated even though refreshed in 2017. On balance, the A4 is almost perfect in it\\'s execution of daily tasks called upon by a sedan and is a pleasure to drive. It\\'s a Great Car to Own, and only has some Flaws Great car, period.  The only problems I\\'ve found are  (1) up and down driver\\'s seat lumbar support doesn\\'t go \"low\" enough,  (2) the \"cup holders\" are too far forward and thus are not great for holding large coffee mugs, and (3) I\\'m still having trouble with the \"voice recognition\" for the navigational system (perhaps I didn\\'t learn enough \"English\" in high school Audi Newbie and loving it! Have driven BMWs, Jaguars, and Acuras before, and this 2017 Audi A4 with the virtual cockpit is one nice car.  While the ride is firm, the driving feels light and with purpose.  The acceleration is exhilarating and fast.  The braking is trusted and precise.  Maneuvering this car is so effortless, it makes race car drivers out of everyone.  The overall external look is understated yet well designed with luxury and sportiness in mind.  The internal is simple and nicely laid out but with technology oozing and quality materials and standard leather seats cradling you every time you drive.  The MMI is simply the best and easiest to use.   I\\'m running out of superlatives to use, but don\\'t just read this review, go and actually drive one, and all the others like BMWs and the Benzes, and you will more than likely come to the same conclusion.UPDATE:  After over a year of driving the A4, it still drives so fine and fast.  Had my yearly maintenance.  No issues found.  The A4 is such an amazing machine that you don\\'t have to think about or even worry that something will conk out.  Acceleration is still fluid and fast.  Transmission shifts crisply.  Car electronics works as advertised.  Yay to the A4.  A solid and refined sporty car.  Update: it’s been 9 months and I’m still loving my A4. It’s like coming home when I get into it. All the controls are in the right place. It’s still zippy fast and the gas mileage compared to my previous Acura MDX has been a godsend. It’s very easy to love the A4. It just works and it does it very well. Very nice car, but unreliable acceleration Great quality control, good front seat comfort, marginal rear seat comfort, but unreliable acceleration when you really need it Sometimes the acceleration when needed in traffic is good, other times the car places you in harm\\'s way by not accelerating for a few seconds. Completely unacceptable in my opinion.   We had a Mercedes C300, traded it for the Audi A4.  We will go back to Mercedes with the next purchase.  Audi has attempted unsuccessfully to find the non-acceleration problem. Sport Package makes a world of difference I have owned 2 x 2017 Audi A4 in the span of 6 months. I traded in a 2013 BMW 320i with Stage 1 Dinan 6 speed manual (comparable to stock 328 i) for 2017 Audi A4 Premium Quattro. When I did the test drive, I drove the one with sport package and Premium Plus trim. I chose this car over Lexus IS 350/IS200t/IS300 , Jaguar XE, BMW 328i and BMW 340i(yeah!) first time around. the key reason was the responsiveness of 7 speed Dual Clutch transmission(coming from manual). Although other brands have numbers behind them, the transmission-engine combination can challenge the higher engine trim Jaguars and BMWs and it is way more refined. The Quattro system is obvious while cornering or taking turns with confidence, especially when it is wet. Dallas toll roads can be very prone to hydroplaning and boy, does it rain hard here.   First time around.. to save costs, I went with the Premium.  The car drove well(super quick with launch control and sport mode, paddles), but I was not happy with the speakers and sound system, although I am far from being an audiophile and I was not a fan of the base system and I was not a fan of the Ibis white exterior without the S-Line trim. So decided to bite the bullet and trade it in with 6200 miles and 6 months of ownership for 2017 A4 with Premium Plus/-Quattro with Sport Package. Although sport suspension and seats don\\'t seem to make a difference on paper, they make a big difference in the way this car handles. I don\\'t have the adaptive damper package which is available in Prestige trim, but this suspension is how this car should be in the first place. It is way more planted without being jarring and a ride quality/comfort above anything else in its genre. But coming from BMW, this is more close to the handling I am used to. I am a happy camper now. I love the Android Auto/Apple CarPlay with the Bang and Olufsen 3D sound. I personally stayed away from Tech Package(although cool and envy inducing and great conversation piece) since in my opinion, it is a little too risky to have in a first year German vehicle...So bottom line is for those normal people(not the trackers and oversteer/opposite lock enthusiats) migrating from BMW and convinced about 2017 A4(which should  not be difficult  ), I would highly recommend checking the Sport Package and Quattro. For someone with slightly elevated sense of sportiness in a car, it is a perfect fit for me. Also, I have lost money on Premium to warrant such an opinion, I guess..:-) Comfort and performance This car does have that balance of comfort and sporty drive. BMW may be sportier, while Lexus may be more comfort, for me this is the best of both worlds.   I\\'ve only had two weeks but love the ride, acceleration, and he included features. Comfortable seats. Nice cockpit. Overall exterior design is great.   Only negative as some have mentioned is that there appears to be some kind of lag when first hitting the accelerator which I\\'m still getting used to. But once it gets going, even the 190hp engine is pretty decent. Definitely not a driver\\'s car Excellent design inside the cabin and exterior- good materials and quality. The tech is top of the class but if you enjoy driving this is not the car for you. Too often on long trips and such will behave like a fwd vehicle, the steering sucks even with the sport package (no way to fix that dead on center Audi feel- it\\'s not old Lincoln bad by any means but not in league with Mercedes\\' , BMW\\'s, Cadillac\\'s, etc...) , the suspension is not close to what the three series has (I even opted for the adaptive one) - this has been the most disappointing car for me that I have ever purchased -mainly because I want to love it as it is the only one that checked all the boxes on what I wanted (tech features , bang and olufsen sound system, top safety pick, great real world fuel economy, love the looks, etc) Driving around town it can be a lot of fun but if you aren\\'t constantly pushing the car then it loses any illusion of a sporting nature and becomes a very bland drive. If they could get it to have the road manners it does when pushed all the time then it would be an awesome vehicle , just disappointing otherwise.- Update- I got rid of the vehicle and got an Alfa Romeo Giulia and have not looked back; the interior is not finished as nicely as the A4 and the rear seat legroom is not quite as big but drive one and you’ll understand. Hopefully Audi can learn from corporate cousin Porsche how to make a vehicle that actually feels nice to drive- they have some of the best styling in the industry and fit and finish is great as well. 2017 A4... Audi steps up it\\'s game I\\'m loving the car so far.  Imho it\\'s the best value in the small luxury sport sedan class this year.   I have the premium plus trim and it has almost everything you would want.  But if you want all possible safety features you will need to step up to the prestige trim. Also the interior LED lights that allow you to change color is only on the prestige, the premium plus has only the white interior LED lights.  Some web sites say the car is slow off the line... I haven\\'t noticed.  It feels amazingly smooth and easily goes 0-60 in 5 secs.   Also some sites have dinged the car for non responsive steering and again I disagree.  The car feels nimble and smooth weaving in and out of traffic.  My previous car was a 6 cylinder Infiniti g35 this car feels faster and more agile and does 10mpg better fuel efficiency.  I did one long trip out the car on comfort ride and did 33mpg averaging around 75 mph.   One thing I think could be better is the engine auto off... It\\'s very noticable and the car feels like its stalling .   It can be shut off but I assume it will effect fuel economy. Awesome car Love this car! Great to drive, excellent performance First impressions - a Audi A4 Leased this car. 15 days into it I love it!    Pros -- nice and intuitive controls and excellent MMI interface.  Good interior.  Fun and comfortable driving (compared to my old Camry).     Cons - slight lag during acceleration and wish back seat with little more roomier. Love the A4 Great all around car with great balance of performance and comfort. Terrific technology too. great car drives very nicely, love the sport suspension/seats. Best car I\\'ve ever owned Loved my Lexus and Infiniti cars, but the A4 tops them both. I can\\'t review reliability yet, as I\\'ve only had the car for a month. My brother loved mine so much that he bought one the next week. Extra bonus: getting an average of 30 mpg and my insurance actually went DOWN $400 a year, presumably because of all the safety features in the car. Simply perfect, but after 5k miles Yes, it\\'s that good. I owned the current generation Passat, but traded it in a few years ago for a 328i. I loved the beemer and always missed the Passat for its all around good road manners and build quality. Needless to say the Audi is a finer automobile than the Passat with similarities. This is our 3rd Audi in 10 years. They are underrated. This is as good as it gets for a mid sized sedan. And it\\'s design, inside and out is classic and practical, and will look good on the road for years. The new generation should have had a little more standout change. You will be very pleased with your gas mileage. Once you buy a German made vehicle you will find it difficult to settle for anything else.....in my opinion. And my updated review: 6 months later. I grew very bored of this Audi, because, well, it\\'s boring. It is actually little better, if at all,than the Passat. Coming up my driveway into the garage is where the turbo lag problem really \" shines\". The front wheel drive in combination with the light front end and too powerful engine is downright dangerous if you are trying to pass someone. Many times, I nearly lost control of the car. It is time for Audi to add more value to this car. It is just too bare bones for 40k. You don\\'t see many on the road in the luxury drenched area I reside....that\\'s telling. Yes we have an Audi agency here, and it\\'s not very good either. Pleasently surprised I had a \\'13 BMW 320i with Dinan Stage 1 and M Sport(with 6speed manual). It was really a fun car, with enough power and great dynamics. Since I was getting older, and my wife needed an automatic and was sitting in traffic a lot, we decided to get an automatic with more linear power(read I6/V6). Shopped around for Lexus IS350 and BMW 340i. 340i was good, but moving from manual to automatic, I didn\\'t find the transmission react fast enough for my tastes. IS350 with its 8-speed transmission was also not as responsive. So I started looking for vehicles with dual-clutch given faster shift times and better response. Audi A4 is one of the few cars in the market with 7 speed DCT in the price range and new 2.0T motor is torque rich and in fact I found the vehicle better than sportier S3. Also even the base trim(Premium) has the Android Auto/Apple Play combo negating the need for nav package(mine has Convenience package, which is a must-have). And Quattro with rear-bias is another feature worth paying for. All in all, I got almost 5K off sticker on a brand-new vehicle which is a way better deal than BMW 328i(RWD),  Lexus IS300(AWD) and Acura TLX-V6 SH-AWD which are way out of Audi\\'s league in terms of responsiveness and ride quality. Handling is little better in BMW, but everything else is dated. Previous Audis never impressed me, but this vehicle is quite a revelation and definitely worth considering if you are in market for entry level sporty-luxury sedans. At least until Lexus and BMW move to next generation, Audi seems to the best all-rounder in the segment. 2017 Audi A4 prestige quattro I bought the prestige over the premium because i wanted the driver assist option. i compared to Bmw 3 and 4 series and Mercedes c class. Audi was my preferred choice for overall driving experience and amenities. The driver assistance program is very good if you have to do a lot of driving in congested traffic - takes a bit of getting used to but very helpful Great value for this segment; hits the sweet spot This car is the best combination of value, luxury and sportiness in this segment.  The performance is surprising given the comfort and luxury.  The cost is competitive when factoring in all that you get.  A must drive if you are looking for an entry-level sport-luxury car. Love my car This is my first Audi.  Before buying I drove a BMW 328i xdrive and a Mercedes c class.  They were all very nice cars but I fell for the Audi and love it.  Most of the complaints that I read are about the shifter and the way you have to put it in Park, but I think that Audi got that right.  It is easy and intuitive.  I don\\'t understand the people that complain about it.  It works so much better than the conventional system.  It is so quiet inside.  The ride is fantastic.  Handles great.  My son borrowed it for a couple days.  He told me that on his way home from work he found himself taking the longest route available so he could just drive it longer.  It\\'s the first car I\\'ve had that when I have nothing to do, I just take it and go for a drive. First Sedan in 20 Years! In 2011, I was beginning to look around for a new car, I liked what I drove, but no longer needed a mini-van or a crossover.  Test drove a BMW and a Ford.  The Expedition wasn\\'t any thing special, and the BMW salesman was so snooty that wouldn\\'t have bought a soda from him.  My husband suggesting looking at the Audi dealership.  I wasn\\'t too thrilled, he had a 1985 Audi when we first married, and it wasn\\'t very reliable.  Imagine my surprise when I test drove a 2012 Q5.  It was fabulous, never had any trouble with it, decent gas mileage and was fun to drive.  After 4.5 years with my Q5 I felt like it was time to trade it in while I had a lot of equity in it (Retained its value very well )  The new A4 was just starting to be talked about.  I test drove one of the first ones my dealership got, and feel in love.  It handles exceptionally well, I can zip around those land yachts!  I am equally impressed with the gas mileage - about 30 mpg in mixed trips.  It is a different feeling getting in a car lower than a SUV, but I have gotten used to it.  Very pleased with this model. Too Rich for my blood Great car.  Wish I could afford it. Black Beauty  Be still my beating heart! Update - 1 year in...I\\'ve owned this car for a year now and am still completely delighted with it. In fact, I\\'m so happy with it, we\\'ll probably get a Q3 or Q5 for my wife when the time is right.  The car is solid, performs really well, gets amazing fuel mileage (I drive almost all highway), is super comfortable and is simply the best driving vehicle I\\'ve ever owned.  I honestly haven\\'t had a single problem with it yet.  Just buy one!  You won\\'t be disappointed.Original Review:After owning 3 Acura\\'s in the past 12+ years, I\\'ve now had my 2017 A4 Premium Plus for about a month now. The shifter is confusing but this car is such a dream to drive, I\\'m long past it. So far, with 2K miles on the car, my long term average is over 32 MPG.  Put this baby into sport mode and the 7 speed automated manual transmission will put a smile of your face every time! The sound system is amazing and the cockpit is whisper quiet. The virtual cockpit makes this one of the coolest, most advanced interiors on the market This is my first 4 cyl car in a long time and I\\'m completely impressed!  I drove every competitor before choosing this and nothing could compare.  I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about this beauty. Do Not Get the Aluminum Decorative Inlay I can\\'t believe Audi came up with this Aluminum thing.  When the sun hits it, it gets so glaring.  And of course, around midday, the sun will surely hit it because the Audi design is so aerodynamic.  This Aluminum thing reminds me of a similar design that Honda came up with about 12 years ago for its Civic.  That was glaring too.  But Honda dropped it.   But Audi caught it and put it on its A4??  So I recommend paying extra for the dark wood or brown wood.  About everything else, A4 is completely redesigned.  I\\'m quite happy.  I may write an update in 6 months. 2017 a4 prestige I have always been interested in owning an A4.  The new 2017 A4 prestige meets my vehicle requirements at this time.  It is sporty, fun to drive, packed with safety features and looks great!  My A4 has the  head up display, sport, technology,  and warm and cold weather package.  The interior is trimmed with burl wood and the door exit lighting includes the Audi beam ring projectors.  The virtual cockpit is awesome!!!!!  It consists of google maps and google earth.  Gas mileage is very good.    Audi packed a lot of technology into the 2017 A4. Love my Gotland Green 2017 A4 I\\'ve had my 2017 A4 quattro Prestige for 3 weeks now. I love this car. First time I\\'ve had an Audi I\\'m coming out of a 2014 BMW 428i coupe. This car is light years ahead of the BMW in terms of technology. The car my dealer had on the lot had the full tech and driver assistance packages. I wasn\\'t planning to get all of these features but I got a great price on the car and I do love the features. The heads-up display is awesome. I love the highly customizable LED interior lighting too. The virtual cockpit along with large center screen are so amazingly clear and easy to use. I love how well thought out the graphics are. The fit and finish inside is very good everything from the paint finish to the seams inside and out. No rattles or anything. The front seats (which my car has the warm weather package and in Florida that\\'s a must) are very comfortable. Love the design, headlights, tail lights, grille, wheels on my Prestige with gray/silver 2 tone. This car looks so sharp, literally. If I had to give anything that could use improvement, and this is really hard, I\\'d say: the bang and olufsen stereo doesn\\'t sound as good as my Harman Kardon system in my BMW. I\\'ve played with the sound settings and when playing certain songs on the radio there\\'s a \\'tinny\\' sound to mid and high tones I can\\'t get rid of. Only other thing is the sport seat any model has the side bolsters on the lower cushion are hard to come into contact with while entering the car. I hope over time these don\\'t show premature wear and tear. But, as a 6\\'3\" driver I have plenty of room in this car both leg and headroom. The trunk is spacious too and I love the 40/40/20 split folding seats. This probably won\\'t be my last Audi based on my experience this far! Great Car so far, so good.  I got the S-Line, Premium Plus package and am very happy with it.  Quality it top notch inside and out.  No issues at all, though I\\'ve only had it for a month and about 1500 miles. I love this car  All new A4 Premium Plus I am brand new to Audi. I recently just purchased the all new A4 back in May. This car is a total blast to drive! I couldn\\'t be any happier with the performance and quality. Love my A4  Cutting edge entry luxury Impressive technology, interior design, and ride quality with silent interior at speed. Outstanding tech wrapped around a really good car I test drove a lot of cars (3-series, C300, GLC, XC60, Mazda6, Mini Clubman) before choosing the 2017 A4 and so far, I really enjoy the car. Right now, I think it offers the best mix of tech, performance and luxury in the class, at least until the next 3-series or whatever leapfrogs it. Pros: - The tech goodies are really impressive. Virtual Cockpit is fantastic and having the nav right in front of you in a huge display is actually very useful. It\\'s easy to learn the basic functions of the infotainment system, but it is worth the time to dig deeper and really understand all the different ways you can customize the experience. It makes the car a lot more enjoyable. Even with all the tech, the usability is much better than Mercedes and Lexus. Honestly, you really need to get the technology package to get the best out of this car. - Beyond the gadgets, this is a very good driver\\'s car. Acceleration and braking are very strong, especially with quattro. The ride is firm but controlled. The steering is lighter than I would prefer though. - The interior is not as rich as the C-Class and the GLC, but the materials are high quality, visibility is excellent and the look is very clean and modern. I am 6\\'2\" with really broad shoulders and size 14 feet, and I have enough head and legroom in the front. I did not fit well at all in the C300, IS and Jaguar XE. The 3 series also has a pretty roomy cabin.- It doesn\\'t use run-flats and has an actual spare tire. I never cared until my wife and I both had flats last year. I had a spare tire. She didn\\'t. I was able to get moving again. She had to get towed. Enough said. Cons: - Setting up the AudiConnect trial was a pain that required multiple phone calls and websites. I was told there were issues with both the new A4 and Q7. I work in tech, so I was able to muddle through this and get everything set up, but Audi really needs to improve the process. - Exterior styling is handsome, but too much like the last generation A4 and the current A3. It\\'s really difficult to tell them apart at first glance. It would have been nice if the new A4 was a little more distinctive- Interior storage could be better. I love the adjustable center armrest, which seems to be a VW/Audi signature, but it doesn\\'t fully cover the compartment, so you can\\'t store anything showy in there. The glovebox is also very small, but at least there is a deep compartment next to the steering wheel that can hold a decent amount of items. - I wish you didn\\'t have to pony up for the Prestige package to get the additional driver assist package. LA traffic would be a little less annoying with the dynamic cruise control, but cost aside, Prestige models are almost impossible to find on dealer lots right now, and good luck getting a color other than black or white. - With all the new tech, I hope long-term reliability isn\\'t an issue. From a 328 xi to my new A4! First of all, let me tell you that I loved driving my 2013 BMW 328xi, it was a fully loaded sports edition car, loved the acceleration, handling and looks! my only issue with it are the run flat tires that after 30K miles starter making a noise comparable to a bad bearing, but even with that, since my lease was coming to an end, the shopping began and I was certain I was going to get another BMW.Although this time was not as crazy to get the fully loaded version since there where soooooo many features that I\\'ve never used and just payed for them any ways, this time around I was just looking for the car with the features I enjoy: Moon roof, sports wheels, heated seats, leather interiors, and that is it. Obviously, BMW car dealers only had cars with most of the high end stuff and even that we were able to find the right car, the price tag was high since wanted to stick to the 240 Hp of the 328 vs the 180hp of the 320.My wife owns an Audi Q5 and we happened to be in the dealer for a service and started to look around the brand new Audi A4 and learned about the upgrades on the design and technology and fell in love with the new car.This model comes with a 252hp engine, 0-60 in 5.8 sec and driving modes that made me forgot my intentions to buy another BMW.Some of the Pros that I see vs BMW:1. Tires (of course)2. Value. you get a 328 kind of performance with a 320 price tag3. Car play. Love the integration with your smart phone4. Space.5. The premium model it was perfectly packed to my needs, only thing I didn\\'t need but is included is the rear view camera and got a credit for its cost!6. More comfortable than the BMW. Although sporty, it rides extremely well!The only minor thing that I have notice is that there is a little bit of reaction time when you press the accelerator, but once is going is pretty amazing.3 years ago I test drove an A4 before getting my 328 and there were not even close, and while purist may say that BMW performance is better I will say that you get 95% of the BMW with 85% of the cost which to me is a pretty good value for your money Great but could use a few convenience items First off, the car is great. I have put on a couple thousand miles and have been pretty happy so far. I do have a few gripes. I\\'m coming from a 2008 RAV4 so this is my baseline. Glove box is very small. Yes there is a CD player in there but still...it\\'s kind of worthless for storage. That said, storage is pretty much non-existent. The RAV4 has a bunch of compartments for all my stuff. The A4 has nothing other than the glove box. No sunglasses holder. I can\\'t put a large Gatorade bottle in the cup holder unless I put it upside down. My RAV has a removable rubber cup holder insert so I can put the bigger bottle in it. Side pockets are small as well. The interior is otherwise well done. Gas mileage is great. Performance is excellent. Stock tires are quiet but do not seem very grippy when pushing it.Overall very happy with my purchase, albeit with a couple of complaints. Distinguished The new A4 is not flashy.  But it is luxurious and competent.  Steering is precise, braking excellent, and power is more than sufficient.  The car is a joy to drive - quiet and comfortable. 2017 Audi A4 sets luxury entry level A complete redesigned A4 reaches new levels of technology and luxury.  The technology in this winner is state of the art.  I almost feel like I need to go back to school and get an IT degree to get the most out of this amazing vehicle.  Apple Car Play works like a charm the minute you plug into the designated USB port in the glove box.  For you Android people it also handles Google Play (or whatever the comparable technology is named).  The ability to load the Nav system where you would normally find your speed and RPM dials gives you the feel that you are the pilot in a 747.  Speaking of the Nav system it is the best of any vehicle I have ever owned or system used.  That includes Honda, Acura and Garmin.   So many electronic gadgets that I urge you to check out this magnificent machine online.   I am also surprised at how well it does on mpg -- I got 31.5 on highway driving.  I\\'m sure that will even improve on a longer trip.  Very pleased with this purchase.  My sales rep at Audi Natick, Kevin Schuster, was great.  Only drawback is it takes premium fuel, but with this high performance engine it\\'s worth it.  The 2017 A4 is a winner in every way. 2017 Audi A4 Prestige Quattro AWD 4Dr The new A4 design is a redesigned automobile based somewhat on the Audi Q7 cabinet.  Audi was smart enough to keep somewhat of the same exterior design. They were smart enough to add technology to the interior cabinet in place of big outside body changes.   With that said, the inside cabinet has totally changed - for the BETTER. There is more room and comfort, better placement of hand controls, a well-placed cup holder, and three very smart user display areas across the center console, driver dashboard, and windshield .  Compared to the previous model, it is a comfortable rocketship with added safely technology and conveniences surrounding the entire cabinet, including the heated back seats.  The only big drawback is the Apple CarPlay needs to be connected via a cable and not via wireless bluetooth. Yes, we are Apple iPhone users.  Another concern is BMW, Mercedes, and other car manufacturers moving away from Apple, since they are supposedly building their own car line. My questions are: will Audi stay up-to-date with Apple upgrades and changes, or move away?  And even if they stay with Apple or Android, can these new designs - Apple CarPlay and their GPS accept a software upgrade?   In regards to the new A4, I would recommend it.  The changes are enough to get me to the showroom. Hats off to the online marketing department.  In regard to price, it is pricer with all the new option stuff. In closing, I will probably buy one in June because my wife loves her A4, I love her, and it\\'s time to trade up.   Good luck with the car hunting! Greatest ski car 7 winters of driving up the mountain to ski and this car has seen it all.  Truly unbelievable in the snow and ice.   Very fun to drive, likes to corner fast and enjoys staying up above 3000 rpm. Perfect Seattle vehicle. Ultimate Audi This is by far the greatest car I\\'ve owned. You can\\'t beat this Quattro in the snow. Just awesome. Vehicle is built like a tank. Go from Hondas all your life to an Audi, it\\'s night and day. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful... 2000 Audit A4 1.8T Quattro Has been a great car. Second owner - \\rcame off a lease. Had it chipped - not \\rreally worth the $500. Had to have the \\rmass air sensor replaced at 30,000 \\rmiles - know issue with VW and Audi. Good surprise Had to get a station wagon because of \\rdog.  Was very pleasantly surt how much \\rI liked the A4 Quattro 4WD.  4WD is \\rseamless and much appreciated in CT \\rwinters.  Interior is very high quality \\rright down to cup holders.  Have had it \\rfor 3 years and because of quality, it \\rstill looks like new. A Great Car I have never had a problem with this \\rcar.  It zips around effortlessly and \\rit handles great.  Reliable, gorgeous, \\rand sporty. The perfect anti-SUV My 2000 A4 2.8 Avant quattro is the \\rideal alternative to the typical poseur \\rSUV.  This car has multiple \\rpersonalities, but is is not a \\rdisorder.  It is sporty, elegant, \\rfunctional, unpretentious and filled \\rwith superior German engineering, \\rdesign and safety features.  The \\rinterior design and build quality is \\runmatched by any other car at any \\rprice.  The all-wheel-drive has \\rbecome one of my favorite features, and \\ris the most sophisticated system out \\rthere.  The only other car I considered \\rwas a BMW 3-Series, an excellent car \\rbut saddled with a snotty, \"hey-look-at-\\rme\" image.  The Audi is cool, \\runderstated technical and design \\rsophistication. Best car I\\'ve ever owned I\\'ve had this car for almost 2 years now and I still love it.  When I was looking at cars, it was between this and the newly released BMW 323 wagon. Even though the Bimmer had a lower base MSRP, when you added all the features to get it close to the Audi, it ended up costing more. Plus, the Audi has AWD and a nicer interior.  Audis have, hands down, the nicest interiors around. Unless you are into modifying cars, get the V6 with the leather interior. The B5 is alive! This is an amazing car, fast, reliable, and sticks to the road like glue.  I\\'m driving 6 hours or more for work occasionally, this car makes it fun and safe. Awesome, but high cost of ownership This was the most luxurious and fastest car I ever owned. I previously came from a Jetta that didnt have traction control. Minnesota winters suck so I thought id try out the Audi A4 Quattro. Handled like a beast! I had to sell to pay for college, but I had hose leak which caused an annoying serpentine belt squeak. Found out from the new owner that the front axel snapped and blew out the motor mount, very unfortunate. had 137kIF youre gonna buy one, get the carfax, and make sure timing belt, water pump, suspension drag link and CV boot and all that have been inspected or replaced! the 00\\' was the most reliable model in my opinion. Bad luck or actual crap of a vehicle We bought this car for my kid. The car had 121k miles which isn\\'t much from the reviews I have read on this vehicle.  But,after owning it for less than 2 weeks it was in the shop.  4 months later, I stuck over three grand into this vehicle and it won\\'t stop breaking.  It seems like as soon as I fix one thing, another one breaks. I am ready to take it to auction. It is what it is... When you buy an Audi you have to accept it for what it is. My 2000 A4 1.8 Front Track has 150,000 as of yesterday. I\\'ve put 65,000 on it in my 5 years of ownership. Right now the dash is lit up like a Christmas tree, but rather than be obsessed with those lights, I just keep on driving. I think people should stop trying to keep the \\'check engine\\' light out and just accept the fact that Audis have issues. However, that doesn\\'t prevent them from being an outstanding car. My Audi at 150,000 has many issues, but it also starts, stops, and gets me where I need to go. It\\'s fun and has always been dependable.  Best car I\\'ve ever owned! 2nd owner of a Audi factory specialty built 1999 A4 with all 2000 model year toys like nav, xenon, recaro seats, ESP.  Best car I\\'ve ever owned!  Only two dislikes and they are minor.  Otherwise a very solid car that I\\'ve driven throughout Germany,  Switzerland, Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, Holland and France.  I definitely recommend a 2000 Audi A4 Quattro, and would also say to buy winter tires and summer tires then rotate to avoid AWD tire issues. Good for a horrible winter driver Just traded in my trusty \\'93 BMW 318is 5 speed w/250k for my 2.8 A4. This car is awesome in the snow! (granted I went from rear-wheel to all-wheel) I spun the Bimmer out so many times just trying to get outta the driveway. Some electrical malfunctions, (dash board has streaks going thru the lettering, check engine light w/ no code apprearing, ) the front right tie rod squeaks, but the roads are so full of potholes here in ne Ohio, I\\'m lucky I still have a straight rim to roll on. Even being the daughter of the service advisor isn\\'t going to help with the costs to repair, but knowing I will be safe and sound this upcoming winter is worth it. My audi I got the car with 80000 miles and put an extra 40000 in the past two years and I can\\'t imagine anyone having as many problems with a car than I had. Very expensive to repair the smallest stuff. The acceleration is horrible but I love the handling and brakes. I like how the lights light up a lot and love the heated seats. Everyone complains about the zero room in the back. Can\\'t stand the buttons always jamming in the cold... cheap. Love my car I bought my Audi new from the dealer and have enjoyed driving it for the past 6 1/2 years. I love the responsiveness of the engine, it is zippy and just a blast to drive. I have a stick shift. It has great traction on the road and in the snow. Repair-wise, I have not had anything terrible happen to my car. I had an electrical problem at about 2 years old, but once it was repaired, I\\'ve been fine ever since, and I got a new radio out of that deal! I have not experienced problems with the brakes wearing out or anything like that. Now that I am over 60K miles I take it to a reliable local repair shop that is more convenient and less expensive. This is a great little car. Best car I\\'ve ever had. Don\\'t buy this car I bought my Audi A4 1.8T in 2000 new. Over the last 7 years of ownership (and 69,000 miles) I have had to replace different sensors on the engine 7 different times, the last, just 2 weeks ago at $700 for two oxygen sensors. Just 4 days later I was in Audi service again for a hose that needed to be ordered, and a total of $170 would be needed. I was so mad I sent my Audi to the used car auction. I also had to replace brake pads every 11,000 miles. I thought this was also unreasonable. I averaged between $800 and $1,000 a year for maintenance and have decided this car is not worth owning. Long term review of certified car I am positive the car did not receive a detailed review as part of the Audi certification process as too many things were wrong with the car within the first several days of ownership - cruise control, computer display, rear window switches on drivers door opened the wrong window.  Great Car All Conditions I purchased my first premium European car with a 2000 Audi A4 Quattro.  I got the 1.8T with a 5 speed manual.  An automatic may be sluggish so the 5 speed makes the car more fun to drive.  If you are getting into an Audi you must get a Quattro.  I am passing SUVs with this thing when the weather turns \"ill\"! Fast Cars and Freedom I have only had it a few days so I am not sure about reliability. I really fell in love with the car when I drove it. Small engine yet feels powerful, and able to please. I am a Daimler Chrysler man, but I really am into German vehicles in general. It is no Hemi, but with 35-40 mpg that is ok. This car pulled me to it. I am very impressed so far. Changing the oil was unique that is for sure. Service on a vehicle so advanced is a little scary. Good so far! I am a member of SCCA & I know from watching the Audi in action that its a stronger car than BMW or Mercedes on the track in endurance & performance. My Audi has so far been perfect. It does idle rough sometimes, electronic gauge panel went bad, & sometimes draws back after hitting the gas.  autobahn here I come This has been a very solid car for my wife. It could use a few more horsepower, and I wouldn\\'t recommend it if you have kids or need to have people in the backseat much. Get the quattro, it\\'s worth the extra cash. Car handles great and build quality is second to none. I\\'ve had no major mechanical issues so far (50k). We do experience the occasional electronic gremlin. nothing major, and they always work after re-starting the car. My biggest gripe is.... No useful cup-holders. Oh yeah, the tiptronic shifter is pretty slick, much better than some others I\\'ve driven.  Wonder when the other shoe will drop I have had my Audi 2000 A4 1.8T AWD for five years now and find that anything I have to pay for is expensive.  I have a good dealership, but the labor cost is amazing.  What wears out most for me are the brake pads, every 11,000 miles, and the engine light has gone on at least once a year for vacumn hoses on the engine.  I am very good about oil changes every 5,000 miles and take it in for any maintenance due.  It is a wonderful driving car, and when I go on the turnpike I get great mileage, going much too fast.  I am torn between loving my car and hating it whenever I go to the dealership for repairs.  I would not buy a used Audi. Great car -- when you modify it Yes, out of the box, this car is a little underpowered. But if you drop in a performance chip and cat-back exhaust the car is very different. I also upgraded the brakes and shocks after the OEM stuff wore out. I\\'ve had fewer problems than most with this car -- I\\'ll admit I\\'m lucky. But I do a lot of preventative maintenance. If you want a car you drive and neglect, get a Toyota or Honda.  If you want a car with character, states individuality and is fun to drive, the Audi is it. Only real problem thus far: radio died, but it was replaced under warranty.  It took amost 3 months, but it gave me time to listen to the new cat-back exhaust I had just purchased. Don\\'t buy this vehicle!!!!!   We bought our Audi 1.8T in 2000 and we were very excited about the car.  As of today 5/19/2005 we have about 30,000 miles on the odometer.  From the first year we owned the car we had issues with the Turbo and Quattro drive gaskets leaking air/fluid.  Since the car was under warranty for 3 years, we had the gaskets replaced at the dealer for no charge.  Now off warranty, the dealer told us we needed new gaskets again and it costs $800 to replace.  Our driveway shows signs of oil drops. I\\'ve known other Audi owners having similar gasket problems with their newer AUDIs.  BUYER BEWARE! First Audi -- Love It 75K later. It\\'s strange to hear people complain about all the \"little\" problems they\\'ve had with their A4. I\\'ve had no major problems AND I chipped it and installed aftermarket brakes, shocks, bypass valve and exhaust -- everything the dealer tells you will hurt your car -- after the original equipment wore out. ALSO, I\\'ve always been diligent about using synthetic oil EVERY 5K miles and letting the engine idle at least 1 minute before shutting down if I\\'ve run it hard.  If you want a car like the status quo, get a Honda or BMW. If you want style and performance and are willing to take care of it, get the Audi. Also, understand maintenance will cost more than most Japanese cars, but less than BMW. Expensive electrical problems We previously owned 2000 Audi A4 AWD 2 years ago.  We have been astonished by the frequency and cost of expensive repairs.  Our airbag controller and brake controller have failed, each costing $1000-$1500 to repair.  We have developed an oil-leak costing $1000 to repair.  The bumper scratches incredibly easily and ends up looking terrible.  The interior trim is coming apart.  Net-net, though a very pretty and comfortable car that is fun to drive, the cost of ownership is far beyod what one would expect.  We will never buy another Audi! Audi Certified is the BEST! I read a lot of reviews and all I hear is complaints. It\\'s a used car! You\\'re going to have to change brakes and sensors. You can\\'t complain. Audi Certified is awesome! The best in the biz. My oxygen sensor went which is typical, but the computer ecu didn\\'t catch the code, so ihad problems. They replaced everything even if not broken, all sensors, ecu, air pump, battery, oil change. They paid for it all! They didn\\'t even charge a deductible because I had to bring it in twice! NO warranty would havepayed for sensors, oil change and battery. They wanted me to be satisfied and I am. Remember it\\'s a used car. 60k miles it\\'s going to need maint. My AUDI I bought my Audi on 5/04. The car is \\rsolid and preforms solid. I bought it \\rused. My Audi came with 18\" rims and \\rlow profile Kumho tires. It also came \\rwith a lower suspension and a custom \\rdual exhaust that blows away every \\rother Audi. The only problem is that \\rmy engine light just recently came on \\rand I have kept my car in top shape by \\rdoing oil changes and tune ups. I have \\rto take my car to an Audi dealer and \\rif there is nothing wrong with the \\rmotor, the warranty I bought for it \\rdoesnt cover it. I this is going to be \\rcostly. But its definetly worth it. \\rThe tip-tronic shift on my car hauls \\rbutt.  Lease ONLY-Major Problems When I was car shopping I thought I \\rwas buying a high end car.  As nice as \\rit looks, don\\'t be persuaded by that.  \\rI have had my car for a little over a \\ryear and I have had nothing by \\rproblems.  I had to have the brakes \\rredone right after buying it, 3 seals \\rhave broke, the fuel pump needed to be \\rreplaced, the air sensor thing is not \\rworking.  My check engine light has \\rbeen on 4 times in 12 months and now \\rthe blinkers do not work.  And, I have \\rreplaced about the headlights 4 \\rtimes.  Repairs are overpriced and \\rit\\'s hard to locate a dealer.  Looks \\rare definitely deceiving on the A4. Stay Away From Audi Having owned an Audi it is the worst \\rcar buying experience I have ever had. \\rDon\\'t buy an Audi and stay away from \\rFlemington Audi. The technicians don\\'t \\rknow how to diagnose or repair a \\rproblem without you bringing it in \\rmultiple times.  Audi themselves, \\rdon\\'t stand behind their cars. The \\rbuild quality is extremely poor.  I \\rhave had the same problems everyone \\relse has experienced.  The service \\rarea told me that German cars have a \\rlot of electrical problems and I have \\rhad more than my fair share. The \\rquality of parts going into the cars \\ris the main issue.  What ever you do \\rdon\\'t buy an Audi! Fun to drive The 2000 Audi A4, 1.8T Quattro is a \\rwell built, solid car with responsive \\rhandling and good acceleration with the \\rmanual, 5-speed transmission. The all \\rwheel drive combined with the handling \\rcapabilities makes this a fun car to \\rdrive. Over four years, only one \\rsignificant mechanical problem has been \\rexperienced. Japanese car owners should \\rtry an Audi to compare.   I know what I have I bough the car used. It is actual \\rsecond B5 platfor car in my house. \\rthis is my wifes car. I drive 98 Passat \\rthat basicly uses the same platform. \\rThe car drivers perfectly. So far did \\rnot have any major problems. I see so \\rmany negative opinions here, but the \\rtruth about VAG\\'s (Volkswagen und Audi \\rGruppe) is that these cars requires \\rregural work and check up. If you do \\rall of these you will have a great car \\rfor years. \\rTiming belt is a must after 60k miles. \\r($500-$700 at dealership or $200 DIY) \\rIf wont do it, you might be looking \\rinto new engine. The car is fun to \\rdrive and the AWD is a perfect for \\rMichigan winters. Mostly a good used vehicle! Exterior and interior are both well \\rexecuted.  Nice lines, quality \\rmaterials, and great build quailty.  \\rMy Audi came with the optional sport \\rpackage (16 inch 10 spoke rims, \\rleather seats, lowered suspension) and \\rit looks much better than the stock \\rcar with only 15 inch rims.  Quattro \\ris excellent, especially in winter \\rdriving conditions.  I am slightly \\rworried about future mechanical \\rproblems based on other users reviews \\rbut I have an extended warranty (which \\rI recommend for any used German car) \\rbut I haven\\'t had any problems up to \\r06/2004.  Recommended-with an extended \\rwarranty! Even with Ext. Warranty My car is cute and fun to drive. I \\rlove it...It just doesn\\'t love me. \\rAfter 50K it is beginning to fall \\rapart. Faulty airbag, faulty steering \\rcolumn, disintegrated fuel pump (which \\rled to bent valves and an engine \\rreplacement), whiny turbo, faulty o2 \\rsensor, faulty master air flow \\rsensor... In the past year, the \\rvehicle has had ~$8K in repairs. \\rLuckily I had an extended, but I still \\rsacrifice my time and $50 every time \\rthe check engine light comes on.  It\\'s the whole package--sort of. No other car combines great AWD, \\rexcellent gas mileage, fair price,  \\rand good looks (Subaru gets 3 of 4!).\\rGreat winter car. Reliablity is good--\\rit\\'s never broken down, although it \\rhas had more than a few OOW repairs. \\rShould a cam seal leak at 70k miles?\\rOnly real minus is very small back \\rseat--if you\\'re over 5\\'5\" forget it. Audi A-4q \"Never Follow\" This is an excellent car.  Fun to \\rdrive, very smooth but powerful when \\rneeded.  Quattro with ABS 4-wheel disc \\rbrakes and a solid-build makes this a \\rvery safe car too.  A lot of great \\rinterior features.  The A-4 is one of \\rthe best in class.   Great Car GREAT CAR the most fun, its very sexy, i \\rlove it, its soo amazing id never get \\ranything else. 2000 A4 1.8TQ - Problems after 50K mi In months 0-36, Audi replaced the \\rfront brakes, a CV boot, numerous \\rheadlights & the dash instrument \\rcluster.\\r In months 37-44 (SINCE THE WARRANTY \\rHAS EXPIRED), I have had numerous \\rproblems, including: vacuum hoses, AC \\rClutch, radio, hazard flasher, \\rdriver\\'s inner door assembly - about \\r$1,300 out-of-pocket.\\r The dealer suggested an extended \\rwarranty. Should a $30K+ car be \\rbreaking down less than six months out \\rof warranty?\\r Consumer Reports rates this car as \\ra \"Car to Avoid\" for reliability. As \\ran entry level car, it\\'s not good PR. \\rI may try Acura RL/TL, BMW 3-Series, \\rLexus IS300 or Mercedes C-Class for \\rthe same money. Same Story I bought this Audi for the Style, Fuel \\rEconomy, and how it handles with the \\rTiptronic transmission.  I liked the \\ridea of free scheduled maintenance for \\r50k.  Then, like many others, I have \\rlived at the dealership.  Cruise \\rcontrol, blinking console lights, \\rrough idle, and 5 new headlights.  Too \\rmany problems for a former Honda \\rAccord owner.  Back to Honda!!!! We love our Audi.  It\\'s been a pretty reliable car only \\rneeding a couple minor repairs just \\routside warranty. Despite its seemingly \\rlow HP, it\\'s a blast to drive. The \\rsport package is worth the money, it \\rhandles incredibly well-- quattro is \\rthe only way to go. We will buy another \\rAudi.  Extremely Fun well built sedan  Since the time of purchase my 2000 \\rAudi A4 1.8T Quattro has been nothing \\rbut a wonder to me. It has only had \\rone flaw, and that was the driver \\rside/seat airbag was defective and was \\rreplaced. Otherwise its been a beauty. Audi A4 is THE Car!!! I love my Audi A4.  I bought it because \\rit is very fun to drive is solidly \\rbuilt.  There are many performance \\rupgrades available.  Such as, 500 for a \\rchip that adds 45hp and 85pound/ft \\rtorque.  It has sound accelaration, \\rcornering, braking ability.  A manual \\rtranny is the way to go.  It\\'s been \\rvery reliable and I have 73k so far.  I \\ruse synthetic oil to keep the turbo \\rhappy and it keeps me happy when I ask \\rfor power. love this car this car is awesome. needs a bit more  Fun but costly This is my wife\\'s first new car and I \\rcan say with certainty we will not be \\rpurchasing an Audi again.  This car may \\rbe fun to drive but we seem to be \\rconstantly taking it in to the shop.  \\rIn our case the troubles seem to be \\rwith the key fob, water pump, \\rheadlights, and brakes.  The dealership \\rwas good while vehicle was under \\rwarranty but repairs post warranty are \\rnow terribly expensive no matter where \\rwe take it.\\r Large acceleration lag when you put \\ryour foot down.\\r Cruise control works only occasionally.\\r We will go with something more reliable \\rnext time that is also cheaper to \\rmaintain. A4 2.8 Quattro Finally, I have the car I want! Lot\\'s \\rof fun to drive. quattro 4 life This car has been great..its fun and  Im glad I am not alone with all the mnx! I bought my A4 in Feb since I needed a \\rsafe AWD car in  Colorado...It only  \\rhad 28K mis.   However, my Check Engine \\rlight has been on more then its been \\roff. I have had to replace the \\rsecondary air pump ($460).  I have had \\rto replace the O2 sensor ($230) and the \\rmass air flow sensor ($270) and I \\ractually did the installation myself to \\rsave money.   Audi was no help-in fact \\rRick from Ed Caroll in Fort Collins, CO \\rtried to con me into thinking I had a \\roil leak that was going  to cost \\ranother $600 to repair! Don\\'t buy this \\rcar if you think you can do simple mnx \\ron it--it is too complex!I WILL NEVER \\rBUY ANOTHER AUDI! Nice ride but....too many problems I love the way the car drives and \\rhandles but I have had to take it into \\rthe shop way too many times over the \\rlast year or two.  Not major things, \\rbut things like: 1) loose bolts in the \\rengine, 2) radio lights flickering, 3) \\rsensor in the door stopped working, 4) \\rloud brakes, etc.  For a newer car with \\rlow miles, it is ridiculous.  I will \\rnever buy another Audi despite the fact \\rthats its fun to drive.  Too bad... Enjoy free scheduled mtc while it lasts I love the look and feel of the car \\rand it\\'s been a blast to drive.  \\rHowever, as Mike pointed out..... this \\rcar spends a ton of time in the shop.  \\rAlthough this wasn\\'t a problem at \\rfirst (free until 50,000)it\\'s gotten \\rquite expensive.  The 50,000 mi \\rservice was almost $700 of routine \\rstuff.  Save your pennies for the \\rservice as it\\'s needed every 5,000 \\rmiles. I\\'ve replaced the same \\rheadlight 5 times, water pump went, \\rcomputer problems (dash goes black) up \\rthe wazoo. I\\'ll be trading in soon. \\r(Note this all happened ironically \\rbetween 50,000 and 60,000 miles) Disappointed I love my Audi A4 1.8T, but sadly it is \\ra lemon.  Of course, I find out it is a \\rlemon after the warranty...I will never \\rbuy another A4 because the dealership \\rwhere I purchased it will not take any \\rresponsiblity.  I have taken it in \\rseveral times, and all I hear is the \\rfact that they have never seen an Audi \\rwith so many problems!  Apparently, the \\rAudi corporation does not stand behind \\rtheir product either.  It is a shame, \\rbecause it is such a fun little car.  Like Mike I agree with Mike S.  While I love the \\rperformance of the car, I\\'ve had to \\rtake the car into the shop for \\rmiscellaneous problems every 6-8 weeks \\rfor the last 18 months.  It\\'s never \\ranything terribly serious but it\\'s \\ralways something.  Dash electronics, \\rwater pump, thermostat, speaker, more \\rdash electronics, another thermostat, \\rand EVERYTHING RATTLES.  Not quite \\renough trouble to qualify for a lemon \\rbut too much for a two year old car \\rwith low miles.  I\\'ve complained to the \\rdealership and they pay lip service to \\rhelping me - but nothing ever changes. \\rI really do love the car, but who has \\rtime to have their car in the shop that \\roften?  I\\'m disappointed. Performance, style, comfort and value The 1.8T is very responsive and eager \\rto be worked hard. Although the 1.8T \\rdoesn\\'t have stellar 0-60 times, full \\rtorque is available anywhere between \\r1800 and 5500 rpms. This makes the car \\rfar more powerful in real world \\rsituations than the 0-60 times suggest \\rbecause the engine is virtually always \\rproducing full torque. Handling is very \\rnimble and it holds the road with \\rtenacious grip. Yet the ride comfort is \\ras good as comfort-oriented cars that \\rdon\\'t handle nearly as well as the A4. \\rThe quattro is truly amazing and I pass \\r4x4 SUV\\'s with ease on snowy roads. The \\rA4 is a true driver-oriented sport \\rsedan at a bargain price. Mistake I will start by saying I love the \\rdesign and performance.  But....I have \\rnever had a car in the shop more.  Yes, \\rbecause of the good warrenty, it hasn\\'t \\rcost me anything other than time. I \\rhave replaced more headlights than I \\rcare to remember.  The car has been \\rtowed once, had a brake rotar replaced, \\rconciquental gagets not working \\rproperly, and other misc. problems.  \\rThe shop I deal with has been a horror \\rand Audi has not done anything to \\raddress my concerns.  My lease ends in \\rJanuary and I can\\'t wait to get out. Mistake I will start by saying I love the \\rdesign and performance.  But....I have \\rnever had a car in the shop more.

I \\ralso love the free scheduled \\rmaintenance for the first 50,000 miles. Audi Nightmare!!! This car was WONDERFUL-- until \\rthe warranty expired.  Since then, I \\rhave spent thousands of dollars on \\rengine and suspension repairs.  \\rSteve White Audi (Greenville, SC) \\rhas the least professional and \\rincompetent service department I \\rhave encountered.  Audi of America \\rdoes not hold the dealers \\rresponsible, and make minimal \\refforts to ensure quality service. audi a4 great car fun to drive looks like a  Quattro is the way to go I had a 2001 FWD A4, it was definatly a \\rgreat car as well, but i did not \\rrealize what i was missing not having \\rthe AWD quattro system. I live in \\rflorida, and i figured snow is where u \\rneed quattro, but in a rainy place like \\rflorida quattro is reall amazing. \\rHandling is great, power is great as \\rwell for a 4 cylinder engine. Fun to \\rcustomize as well as drive. audi 2000 car does great in rain or snow What I think of the 2000 Audi A4 2.8 Qua Automatic Transmission shifting erratic and could be dangerous as the vehicle dies when accelerating from 10 MPH to road speed. Dealer claims thats the way it is............. Think twice before owning off warranty. This is my second A4.  First one was great(2012). No issues.  This one (2015) had some issues.  At 28k, the engine light came on.  Service found a cracked intake manifold and bad wheel bearings in the left front.  Would have been 5k in repairs if not for the warranty.  The depreciation is also ridiculous.  I suspect the frequency of repairs after warranty may be the reason.  Great car to drive, but not to own past warranty, imo. Satisfied Audi A4 customer This car was a great value for me and was the first car I’ve owned that I can honestly say was worth every penny Audi A4 Premium Plus AWD Could not justify buying this car new but found a certified pre-owned with low miles and in great condition $20K under the sticker price of a 2018. Overall great Outstanding car, 20K miles After more than 2 years and 20K miles, I can say this car has been great. Excellent acceleration and handling. The sports mode allows for more lively driving. The quattro system is great on curves. No problems with anything and have gone in only for routine maintenance. A few years ago A4s had some problems with oil consumption, but I have not had that problem with this 2015 model and it\\'s possible Audi solved whatever problem was ailing earlier models. Bluetooth works well. My only critique is that the technology is not as good as some other cars (e.g. no backup camera), but I care more about speed and handling than technology. Mileage is really good on the highway. Great looks fun to drive  my first audi today at almost 19000 miles no issues concerns or problems very happy with this investment so far let\\'s hope it stays this way. First Luxury Sedan--Value Decision I am a practical individual and conservative to a fault but I also love style.  The 2015 Quattro A4 sedan fits me perfectly.  The 2015 styling is retro 2009 but has held its own over the intervening six years.  After comparing this sedan with the other two primary competitors, the BMW 3 series, and the Mercedes C class, I found the A4 standard features exceeded both.  Sure I could pay another four thousand dollars for a sun roof, leather seats and hands-free bluetooth but why when I could get these same features in the standard pkg?  The C-class had the best interior but the A4 tipped the scales over the BMW.  The ride comfort and road noise were subdued compared to the BMW but not as good as the Mercedes. After comparing the total acquisition cost, I would have paid another eight thousand dollars for the C300 with similar options.  I ended up adding Nav and heated seats to the other standard features to my A4.  I am very satisfied with my decision and look forward to every drive I take in timeless, efficient luxury.  The only regret I have is the car did not come with a smart key or backup camera --with all the other standard features, this is odd since they even came on my previous Camry.  The inly thing of substance I do not like is the transmission takes what seems to be an inordinate amount of time to swith into and out of reverse (about 4 secs). Great Smaller Luxery Car bigger car feel in a smaller package, well thought through features, great road handling and feel! 405 lbs Great value for a comfortable daily driver. 15,000 miles in 1 year and zero problems. Facelifted B8.5\\'s rarely suffered the oil consumption that plagued many B8\\'s. My A4 has an 8-speed automatic so it is a flex fuel vehicle. great car Runs really nice and smooth A really good luxury car I have an A4 Premium Plus Quattro with the sports packages and a manual transmission.  The interior and exterior are basically flawless - showing Audi\\'s attention to details.  I have drive over 40,000 miles since I purchased this new and have only had a few minor trim issues - nothing serious.  The handling is AMAZING and the car is definitely quick for its class.  I truly enjoy this car - twisty roads are the best as nothing seems to make the car cut lose.  It is a very good looking car and the interior is incredibly comfortable - with nice soft-touch materials.  Overall the car has been a positive experience and I would recommend it to anyone that asks.I only have two minor negatives about this vehicle - neither a reason not to purchase it:  1) The fact that it did not come with Bluetooth streaming unless you upgraded to the Prestige trim with the navigation system - a $4,000 upgrade for something that every Kia seems to come with by default.  2) I have had either indifferent or negative experiences every time I go to the Audi dealer (Plano, TX) for service - this has made it incredibly unlikely that I will ever purchase another Audi.  Even with those negatives this is an amazing car and you should at least test drive it if you are considering it - that may make the decision easy for you!Update at 59,000 miles. At 47,000 miles my clutch went out (manual transmission). It was covered under warranty and they saw no sign of abuse. The head mechanic said that a clutch should last much longer - not sure what happened on mine. Can not wait to sell this car. I bought this car brand new in 2013 and I\\'ve had issues ever since. The car is obviously a very low profile car and I live in New England so I went through 6 Pirelli tires before I finally put all weather continental tires on the car. The car does not drive as smoothly now but at least I have not gotten any bubbles in the tires or cracked any rims since purchasing the continentals. There have been multiple recalls for the heating system, air bags, electronic, etc. that have required repairs. The check engine light came on around 30,000 miles and required multiple valves to be replaced. The dealership claimed they were \"faulty\" but gave no explanation as to what or why. Then, at 41,000 the car DIED on the highway due to transmission failure. I had to have the vehicle towed in the middle of the night to the dealership. The ENTIRE transmission needs to be replaced. Again, the only explanation is that it was \"faulty\" and they are unsure what exactly went wrong. Thankfully the car is still under warranty, but this does not make me feel any better. There is no reason there should be this many issues and \"faulty\" parts on a car this new. I will definitely be selling this car in the Spring and have NO intention of buying another Audi. Every car has its issues, but given the amount I have had with this car in a short period of time with NO real explanation of the problems from the dealership, leads me to believe Audi\\'s are not as reliable as the price tag would suggest. My engine is gone!!! fabric defect very Sad I have an Audi A4 (VIN: WAUAFAFL9DA143522 / IEN913) bought on April 25, 2013. Recently, I took the car to the service area due to the fact that it was vibrating vigorously while driving. The diagnosis was that a piston was broken and a whole engine replacement was required. In conversation with my service advisor,he informs me that etiology of the damage is related to a factory defect. The car has a current mileage of 21,997 and I have been most responsible with the recommended service schedule, including oil and filter changes.The car has been going through many issues since I bought. I left it in the service area, with the keys, I didn\\'t wanted again!!!  Want a dipstick? Drove 75 miles to get car we wanted.Replaced wife\\'s 2006 Saab 9-3 Sportcombi; would have bought another Saab 9-3 if company hadn\\'t gone belly up.Premium Plus is a well damped firm/rough ride over potmarked New England backroads; highway ride is excellent.Not a big fan of the electronic steering at highway speeds; poor feedback through steering wheel.Wife drives the car and gets 23-24 mpg; I drive and get 28-29 mpg. On the all highway drive home from dealership, trip computer showed 31.7 mpg with cruise at 75 mph; mpg ranges above are using miles driven/gallons to fill tank calculation.If we could afford a Q5 TDI, would get that for the wife, and take the A4 for myself.   Updated review June 2016 at Edmunds\\' request.  Now no longer see  the contents of \"Best Features\" \"Worst Features\"; this blew away the content related to title... WTF!VW part number for dipstick 06J115611E, won\\'t show up for A4 B8 CPMA engine because thereis no dipstick in the car.This dipstick is for CBFA, CCTA engines which are used in Audi A3, VW CC, VWTiguan, among others.Length is correct, but MAX reading is actually where the \"X\" on the \"MAX\"label is covered with oil.Updated review Dec 2016 at Edmunds\\' request.Real world mpg on a New Hampshire to Georgia trip 31 using Shell premium, 32 using Exxon premium; traffic permitting, drove speeds of 75 to 80 miles per hour w/cruise.  Try to avoid buying gas in North Carolina; higher taxes than Virginia or South Carolina.  Thanks to turbo\\'s low rpm torque, car sails up steep interstate highway grades effortlessly. (Example: I77 from North Carolina into Virginia)Updated June 2017 at Edmunds\\' request.Highway trips returning 29-31 mpg on Shell Premium.  Replaced original tires with Continental Pure Contact at 35174 miles (referenced Tire Rack reviews at the time); original tire\\'s tread was still above wear bars, but didn\\'t want to face winter with them.  Now at 50300 miles.  Have used dealer service up to 45k, prepaid at time of purchase.  Dealer service adviser recommended paying out of pocket for service going forward; 55k mile service cheaper out of pocket.  Anticipate using independent service facility going forward.Updated December 2017 at Edmunds\\' request.Doing 55k service myself with parts from Rock Auto, ECS Tuning, 502.00 oil from Walmart.  Dealer service isn\\'t worth the high price. Loyal A4 driver disappointed This will be my 5th A4 in either a sedan or wagon version.While the car looks great inside and out and the improved HP over the years has added to the thrill of driving the new electronic steering has certainly been a negative.If you are looking for a soft feel to lumber off to the grocery store the steering is fine but push it a bit or take a long highway trek and you will notice the floaty feel.Overall the car is fine but if your a searching for a tight steering / handling feel you may want to give the car a good test drive before you purchase.After this lease is up I will definetly look at a tighter car like the BMW. Exceptional quality -- bad sound system I love this car -- it looks great inside and out, the build quality is extraordinarily high, and it offers just the right balance of tight handling, comfort, and size.Personally, I find the engine to be more than up to the task for fun driving (especially when combined with the sport suspension, which I also have), although if you\\'re after raw horsepower you should probably look for something other than the A4 at this price. There\\'s a little more understeer in aggressive turns than in the previous A4, but I can live with it. The Bang & Olufsen sound system upgrade is the only major disappointment -- I am a bit of an audiophile and the thin sound it produces really surprised me. (I didn\\'t evaluate the sound very carefully when I bought the car.) In retrospect I\\'d get the stock system and find a way to upgrade with a third party if the budget allows. 8000 mile update Wanted to update my review first made shortly after purchase.Have owned the vehicle for 8 months now and continue to be impressed by it.No problems after 8000 miles.Car was virtually unstopable in heavy snow (with 4 Pirelli snows mounted) this past winter.I average 26-28 mpg in mixed drving; best tank 34 mpg highway at 70 mph.Despite what some others have noticed, the engine has not consumed any oil in its first 8000 miles.Break the engine in as directed in the manual and there should not be any problem. Love it! I bought an Audi A4 2.0T a month ago and have loved the short time I\\'ve owned this car.I switched from a BMW 325.My wife has previously had an Audi Q7 and currently drives the Infiniti QX56.I think this car has the best styling both inside and out compared to any car in its class.It is fun to drive and nimble although I must admit that my 3 series gets a little bit of an edge in the driving department (that\\'s what bimmers are known for).But overall, in my opinion, the audi a4 is a more complete car than the 3 series if you take everything into account.I have 1500 miles on the car and am averaging between 29 and 30 mpg based on mostly highway driving. Our First Audi After buying a 2013 VW Passat TDI in October for myself, it was my wife\\'s turn for a new car. She had her heart set on a BMW 328i...until she got in one. Too small, too confining, truly baffling ergonomics. We then looked at another Passat TDI(too big), a Jetta TDI(too sparse), a Volvo S80(too something), and finally the Audi A4. We were both sold on it right away due to the Quattro and Nav systems. We immediately put 3,000 miles on it in the first week with a trip to Washington State. Handled perfectly on wet, icy and snowy roads, and was a really comfortable ride. No sign at all of the oil burning issue others have had after 3k miles, so hopefully that\\'s a good sign. Car burns oil My 2013 Audi A4 2.0T burns about 1 quart of oil every 2000 miles.I had read about this issue with older A4, but the dealer had sworn that the problem had been resolved.Apparently not! Best bang for your buck for an AWD luxury sedan This is my second Audi. I upgraded from a 2012 Audi A4 2.0T FWD with CVT. It was a great car. Great performance and gas mileage.However, I had an opportunity to upgrade to a quattro with the light package and 2013 upgrades. So far, the car is awesome. Drives even better with the Quattro and suspension and steering upgrades. And those lights, beautiful. The car is even more stricking then my 2012. I also like the 8 speed auto better then the CVT. Fantastic Vehicle Traded an \\'11 Acura TSX for this 2013 A4 Premium Plus and so glad I did!!Could not get comfortable in the Acura, and too little rear seat room for the family.This Audi is \"right sized\" for a family of 4.Plenty of useable trunk space.Ride is composed but comfortable, 18 inch wheels help the car stick around corners, powerful brakes to haul the car down from speed which it gains easily from the 2.0 turbo running through 8 gears.Excellent fit and finish and an attractive sedan from any angle in my opinion.Electric power steering gives up some feel, but is far superior to that found in the Acura. Icompared with BMW 3, Mercedes C class, Infiniti, and new Lexus ES.A4 was superior! A good choice for its class I just upgraded from my 2010 A4 to the 2013. The 8-speed automatic provides smoother acceleration and better mileage (averaging over 25mpg in mixed driving). They fixed some of the annoying bugs in the \"Infotainment\" system. However I was disappointed to see the folding rear seats move to the premium plus package. The new brown interior is ill-conceived. Should have been a lighter saddle-brown as offered in the BMW. Overall, it\\'s a good value for the class, and works better for me than the 3-series. Don\\'t buy this car The 2013 Audi A4 is no longer a good buy. I am on my third and the changes to the steering have made this car a poor buy. The steering has become loose and numb and when driving past 60 you feel has if you have no control of the car. The 2.0 turbo also bangs constantly at low speeds and if your try to accelerate fast all you get is a pedal of air. Driving this car used to be fun but has become typical of an American car with too much over steer and lack of initial power. The mileage is nowhere 25 but rather a 20 overall and the company suggests premium gas. Buy a volkswagen jetta instead . Audi A4 Wagon, great car but is an oilaholic! I love my 2010 Audi A4 Avant, its the third Audi I\\'ve owned but it slurps down oil at an average rate of a Qt every 670 miles. My previous cars which included two Audis (a 2004 S4 Avant and an 2007 AllRoad V8 never needed the hood opening between services. That is true for the four BMW\\'s (three 7 series and a 535 xi wagon). Its just not right. My dealer Audi of Fairfield County tells me the consumption is within range but we all know that\\'s a sham. Audi agreed to settle a lawsuit last year where they agreed to replace the crankcase pressure regulating valve. front crankshaft seal and front crankshaft bolt, they will also update the engine control module control software to match the new parts, all free of charge. I intend to take this up with them next week. I really love this car and hope this can be resolved or it will be time to move on. I will keep you posted Fun factor Nicest car I have ever owned.  Most fun to drive. Torque, power, handling and stopping power are awesome. Car is pricey (prestige package makes it so) Dealer is a plus. Minor quality initial issues. Drive 4000+ miles in six weeks. Haven\\'t had to add oil per another Audi owner review. Liked my portable Tom Tom better than the pricey Audi nav. B&O sound system is terrific.  Did I say how great it handles???? Love it Test drove everything out there. To be honest, not as good as BMW but much better value. Wife has a 335i. Different league of car. But Audi makes an excellent auto and love drive and fit and finish.  My 3rd Avant Ok I\\'ve been sold on these cars for awhile. This is the 3rd one I\\'ve leased but its the 1st one I\\'m thinking about buying. The B&O stereo is excellent, the NAV is way improved, I like the rear camera, and the extra few inches of width/wheelbase, the seats with the sports package are also much better. Yes the suspension is stiff for a family ride but I\\'m not looking for a minivan with all wheel drive. I want something fun. This is by far the best Avant yet.  These cars are a great mixture of fun, practicality, efficiency, safety and overall value. All 10\\'s This vehicle is a remarkable example of German engineering and build quality. Engine, transmission and drive train are perfectly matched in this sub mid size platform. Body and interior tolerances are precise. Feature benefits are many leaving this driver with anything left to be desired. One word, impressive! The car of my dreams I bought the car a month ago - and I enjoy it so much I take it for a ride on weekends just for pleasure. The car has a Start button (amazing) with a Advance key and a SideAssist(very useful).  This is the car you love more and more with time, something you really need to know to appreciate. Everywhere you go - people would notice you. To drive the car on highways is  just a pure pleasure, the car loves the speed.  The only downside- it is expensive with options, but it\\'s worth every penny. Family wagon = class, fun & style I have only had the 2010 Audi A4 Avant for a month, but it has absolutely bedazzled me. In replacing my trusty Honda Civic, I had the following criteria: (1) AWD to get through Wisconsin winters; (2) roomy enough to accommodate a family of four, but no SUV\\'s or minivans; (3) an attractive and fun-to-drive car. The A4 Avant easily fits the bill.   I can\\'t wait to get into the car each morning - but because my commute is only 10 minutes each way, I take the car for a spin each weekend, cruising over the beautiful rolling hills of Wisconsin.  My only gripe is with fuel economy. I drive mostly in the city, and I have not been able to achieve 21 mpg unless I mix in some highway driving. First, trepidation.  Now, I\\'m sold. It was never my original intention to own an Audi and I signed on the dotted line with some trepidation.  4 months and 4000 miles later, I am sold!  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it\\'s the A4 Avant\\'s looks that got me hooked in the first place.  Our recent 2500 mile round trip down the I5 to California confirmed the comfort of the seats, the agility of the car, it\\'s handling and the surprising acceleration.  It\\'s still hard to believe that a 4 cylinder 2.0 liter engine lies under the hood.  The Ipod audio interface is the best I have come across and the upgraded Bang and Olufsen system was a blast on such a long trip.  The fuel economy was surprising good for an all wheel drive. Nothing But Problems I purchased a used 2010 audi a4, gorgeous car but underneath nothing but mechanical issues. I’m a realist and understand that these things happen but it’s the response of Audi and Parker Audi that made it worse. Unfortunately my vehicle was plagued with the all too well known oil consumption issue. My car was still under the extended warranty so I could gave gotten the problem diagnosed and hopefully resolved free of charge but my local Audi dealer did not give me any confidence that resolving the oil consumption issue was going to happen. If anyone is in the market for a used Audi a4 do yourself a favor and research audi a4 oil consumption issue extensively before making your purchase and save yourself the headache i went through. I will never touch another audi after this and it’s stemmed from the bad customer service I received from Audi. A piece of crap! If you are thinking and going to purchase an Audi...BEWARE! This Audi A4 Quattro has nothing short but a daytime nightmare for me. When I purchased this vehicle in April 2014,the car had 57,000 miles on it and the car was good. At 74,000 I found out the oil consumption issue which was an oil separator kit and the dealer fixed it for free. At 77,121 the turbocharger went bad and the dealer replaced the turbocharger that costs $2800.00 which I had to pay. On March 17, 2017 a day in which I will never forget! The car failed to start when I was ready to leave work on one of the coldest days of the year and when the car was towed to the shop the dealer said the engine was no good, the diagnosis was the timing chain jumped a tooth casing damage to the cylinder head, timing chain and tensioner which will cost $6400.00 to fix. This was a major problem Audi knew about and having the consumer pay for it is absurd.  I joined a class action lawsuit against Audi of America because I have read different posts about this issue.Audis are great cars to drive but when major problems occur they are nothing but huge money pits! Audi A Good Value A good choice in this price class. Awesome Audi!!! This is a very nice, reliable car.  I am truly enjoying the ride......... 2010 Audi A4 2.0 T Prem Plus #1.  Oil consumption -  when I purchased this car it used 1 qt oil every 1k to 1100k miles.  I took it to the dealer.  They worked on electronics and breather and added oil.  They told me to drive it until the oil light came on.  Record the miles driven.  Bring it back for further tests.  They took sample of oil and found metal in the oil.  I was told that from 2009 - 2012, there was slag on the piston rings causing oil to drip and burn causing excess use of oil.  Dealer replaced Pistons and rings.  My car does not use any oil.  Can go oil change to oil change without adding any oil.  #2.  Turbo - At approx 51 k miles, engine light came on.  Took car to dealer for diagnostics.  Turned out to be faulty turbo.  Audi extended warranty of 7 years or 70k miles covered this repair.  #3.  Water pump - Replaced at approx 40k miles.  Out of pocket expense.  Approx $600.00.  #4.  Fuel injectors - While I have not had any problems with fuel injectors, there is extended warranty on the injectors of 12 years or 100k miles. A4 is a total Lemon - Wish we didn\\'t by the Audi This car has been a total lemon. It is constantly in the shop with one expensive repair after another. The Audi dealership in Raleigh also makes it even worse. Lexus provides a much better experience when we bring in our cars there. freaking garbage excessive oil consumption, great ride ,excellent handling. my camry se can do that and cheaper too. Oil Consumption fixed I had this car at 37,000 miles certified preowned. Dealer tried to convince me that oil consumption (quart every 1000 miles ) is normal with turbo which is complete bullsh.... It was repaired at the warranty since I didn\\'t believed and never stopped complaining. \" Under the settlement agreement, current owners or lessees who have not already paid to have repairs made will be entitled to a replacement of the crankcase pressure regulating valve, front crankshaft seal and front crankshaft bolt. Additionally, the engine control module software will be updated to match the new part(s).The agreement also gives owners and lessees an extended warranty of 4 years/50,000 miles to 8 years/80,000 miles (whichever occurs first) to cover any repair needed to correct excessive engine oil consumption.Audi will also reimburse any affected owners of the 2009-2011 Audi A4, Audi A5 and the 2011 Audi Q5 for parts and labor on any previous repairs made for oil consumption problems.\"Since than I have no problem. I used fully synthetic oil from Europe \"Elf\" every 10,000 miles and i am not adding even one drop of oil between intervals. Love the car. I hope to keep it for next 100,000 miles. I changed Air filters, micro filter and Spark plugs two times. I am getting 30 or more mpg on Hwy and 27 in the city. Great car!!!! Next one i am getting is AUDI A4... Great looking car - reliable? Not so much I bought the car certified pre owned in 2011 with 13k miles on it. Before 20k the oil light kept coming on. Took it to the dealer who said it was \"normal\" to use a lot of oil cause it\\'s a turbo. Took it back to the dealer when we had to start putting a quart or more of oil in every 1000 miles. They had to go thru a 3 step process to \"prove\" the car had an oil consumption problem which involved 4 visits to the shop over the course of the better part of a year. They finally had to basically rebuild the top half of the engine. This was around 60k miles. Fast forward to just over 100k miles and the timing chain tensioner failed. Car was of course just out of warranty and despite technical bulletins on the issue and a class action lawsuit the Audi dealership didn\\'t cut us any slack on the repair quote. Over $13k to rebuild the engine or $20k for a new one. We took it to a 3rd party shop and managed to get the work done for a \"mere\" $7k. The ignition coils have failed 3 times in the last year. Random lights keep failing. Fuel pump went bad at 112k miles. Car is now just around 120k miles and has multiple EPC faults, idles rough and randomly dies at low speeds. It\\'s been in the shop 3 times in the last 3 months, still not fixed. This is without a doubt the worst vehicle I\\'ve ever owned. I once drove a 1972 Ford Ltd in the 90s that was more reliable. I would never buy another Audi and the only reason I\\'m still (attempting) to drive this one is its paid off. Except for the repair bills, those keep coming! I Love my Car. I love my car  Fun to drive, but not worth it in the long run. I bought my A4 used at ~38k miles.  Its a comfortable, fun car to drive.  Great on gas, accelerates quite quickly, and with snow tires, it\\'s a champ in the Michigan winters.  However, its been a maintenance nightmare.  Shortly after I bought it, the water pump started leaking.  Thankfully, that was replaced under warranty.  Next, the blower for the front defroster went out.  Then it started burning oil badly.  Turns out this is a common problem, and the fix was basically rebuilding the engine and replacing all of the pistons.  Again, covered under warranty.  But, while doing that work, they discovered that the timing chain was in need of replacing as well, which was not covered under warranty.  And now, not more than 2 weeks after having that work done, the motor controlling the locks on the drivers door stopped working so I can\\'t lock my car.This has been my first Audi, and it will also be my last. 2.0t oil consumption solutions A review to all those having oil consumption problems: I bought my \\'10 a4 2.0t about a year ago off of a lease with about 16k on it. I was sick of bringing it to the dealer where I purchased it from for a top of because of the \"oil min\" light. IT IS NOT NORMAL. Switched my servicing to another Audi Dealer in the DC area, and they learned that my turbo and pistons were not made up to par with what my car required (something about a bad batch). Both my turbo and all oil parts were just replaced in hopes that it will solve the problem and will cause less oil to be burned without necessity.As long as you are persistant, they will fix the problem. Just don\\'t bring it to a dbag dealer Disappointed Audi Owner I am so very disappointed in the performance of my 2010 Audi A4. June 13, 2013 with mileage at 111044 km I replaced both front wheel bearings and hubs at a cost of $1809.50. Then on June 24, 2013 (115240km) Pad Wear sensor had a broken wire. This required new front pads and rotors even though there was still available wear on the original pads. This problem cost $681.63.I have previously owned two Subaru Outbacks which I drove well over the 100,000 km mark. Neither required this type of extensive, expensive repair.Having to replace front wheel bearings at such low mileage doesn\\'t seem reasonable to me. Is this something Audi A4s experience as the norm?Disappointed Audi A4 burns oil I bought an Audi A4 in 2010.The car burns a quart of oil every 2,500 miles.I took it to the Danbury dealer, who told me the oil usage was normal because it was a highly efficient engine and the gas savings more than justified the hassle of replacing oil.I wished thes sales person would have told me that while I was shopping for a car.I would have bought another car. 2010 Audi A4 Burns Oil If you think it\\'s Ok paying $45K for an A4 with all the bells and whistles, but then need to add a quart of oil to engine every 3 months like you used to have to do with your first car when you were 16 yrs old, then by all means buy an Audi A4.I too am having oil consumption problems of about 1QT of oil every 2,000 miles with my 2010 Audi A4 with 21k Miles. Audi has done an consumption test and they report this is within normal for this engine. Really? I have had this problem from delivery of the vehicle.I am now pursuing a Lemon Law case against Audi and am trying to let everyone know of this problem . Do your research & you will see this is a problem. You have been forewarned. 2010  Audi A4  Buy used, It\\'s a better bargain!!!! I bought the A4 Prem Plus with Nav and Backup camera USED and certified from local Audi dealer.A 2012 would have been up around $45,000, I picked up the 2010 with 40k for $24,448.The car is absolutly amazing to drive considering I was driving an 04 Suburban daily.There is a huge learning curve with all the gadgets.I can live with that.Performance of the 2.0T is really nice.Took it on the highway around the corner and goes like hell, was doing 100 before I knew it.Then on another day took it to the casino about 75 miles one way, 36MPG at 60MPH on cruze.At these gas prices in CT that is a real pleasure. I was going to buy a new one year old Lacrosse(2011), but this was better. Owned for less than 1000 miles The CVT was not a responsive transmission like we thought it should be.The car was tastefully designed but the radio horrible to try to use.Loved the exterior design but way overpriced with a CVT Understated sports/lux sedan I feel that the A4 slots nicely between the soft C-Class and business-like 3-Series and provides the driver with a nice balance between luxury and performance. I replaced my A3 with a 2.0T quattro Premium Plus with the sport package because I love this engine. Some people may turn their noses up at a four-banger but there\\'s plenty of torque to merge onto the freeway and to pass, with decent mileage to boot. I\\'ve never been in a situation where I said, \"Boy I wish I had a six.\" The quattro tracks very well through corners with just a slight, but predictable amount of understeer. It rains a fair amount in the winter where I live and having AWD is a nice safety feature. Smooth Ride, great AWD I traded in my 09 Jetta TDI.  It was seriously one of my favorite cars, but now AWD had gotten me stuck more times than I\\'d like.  Without an A4 TDI Quattro option, the 2.0T was the choice.  The car is stunningly beautiful.  Great lines, great lights, and hugely comfortable interior at least for me and my wife.  Would have liked the S4 or at least the B&O sound, but the car is still very nice without them.   Only gripes thus far are a vibrating steering column during reverse maneuvers, a lot of brake dust on the 18\" wheels, and some funky controls.  I love the lights and amenities that this car offers for a relatively low price compared to others in its class. Oil Consumption After 10,000 miles I find myself shuttling to the dealer every 5th weekend for the last 6 months due to the low oil indicator.   They have done an consumption test and they report this is within normal for this engine.  They have nothing else to offer.   After spending 40K I expected more.  After reading on the internet, I see that this has been a common problem.  I suggest staying away.  You\\'ve been forewarned. Be careful with this one I absolutely loved this car until there were oil problems at 2500 miles. At usage of 1500 miles (I bought it with 1000 on it), my car indicated low oil. As it had not been leaking, my car was burning it. Audi of America and the dealer said this was in spec, that turbo engines burned it. They offered to put a quart in every time. They could  not answer to the long-term ramifications however and did not want to fix it. Had I known that my car required a quart of oil per 1500 miles I would not have purchased it because something seems wrong here. ONLY the 09-10 A4s do this. Turbo engines shouldn\\'t burn that much. It affects my fuel efficiency and has taken away the joy of owning a new car. Sharp Car Purchased the A4 Premium Plus Quattro with the 6spd manual. So Far its been a great car for the two months I\\'ve owned it. Has a nice wide stance and pretty roomy compared to earlier models. Love the LED daylight running lights. The LED tail lights are pretty slick also. Descent power for a 4 cylinder. Sound system not bad, controls take a while to get used to. Read on forums that the turbo burns oil, but at 1200mi I\\'m still good. Can\\'t wait to see how it does on the snow/ice.  Interior is very sharp, except for small useless drink holder up front and flimsy drink holder in back. Shouldn\\'t have to use two hands to set a drink down.  Minor flaws I guess for an otherwise great car.  Fantastic My third Audi A4 and my favorite so far. The Turbo 2.0 FSI is strong and turbo lag is almost non-existent. Watch it on the highway as it creeps up to 80 MPH quickly and it doesn\\'t feel like you are anywhere near that speed. The Premium Plus package has some really nice features and the MMI is very easy to use. Voice command feature with the NAV is awesome! No problems at all with the vehicle after 9000 miles. Amazing highway fuel economy!! 200 mile highway trip yielded 38 MPG at 70 MPH on a Quattro! Not hard to get high 20\\'s in stop and go traffic.  Impressed I intended on buying a BMW 128i, but after taking a test drive and being a bit unimpressed (as well as being unimpressed with the dealer), I decided on the A4 and could not be happier.  Other cars I considered were the Mini Cooper S and the Mercedes 300. My previous car was a 2007 Audi A3 which I definitely enjoyed.   I thought the A4 would just be a larger version of the A3 and would offer a similar driving experience.  I was definitely wrong!  In just about every area the A4 is the better car (and this is coming from someone who liked the A3).  It drives more surely with the Quattro, is *much* more comfortable, and handles brilliantly.  Bottom line is I am glad I went with the A4. Don\\'t get the CVT I was given this car as a loaner car while my 06 A4 was being repaired.  Even though my older A4 was broken, I still prefer it ten times over this new model.  The CVT hesitation is absolutely unbearable!  Do not buy the front wheel drive car with the CVT because you will regret it.  The new A4 redesign is nice, but I actually think that the old A4 was prettier, and more engaging.  This new one just feels similar to a Lexus, with less reliability.  You feel disconnected from the road, and in a German car, that is not a good thing since that is the whole reason you buy one. Great Car! Did a lot of research and decided on the A4 over 328xi. Fuel economy of the 2.0TSFI, and the 258lbft of torque really put it over the top. Sport suspension w/ quattro is definitely the way to go, great handling but not too firm on rough roads. Steering is firm and relatively good feedback. Sport seats are great with bigger side bolsters. Interior is comfortable, quiet, and fits two car seats in the back. MMI took a bit to get used to, but easy to use once I got used to it. Same with the cruise control, digital display of set speed is a nice touch. Car has been great on several road trips w/ family of 4. Trunk is huge, 2 suitcases + portable crib w/ room to spare. Very Good, Could be Great I enjoy my daily commute more than ever. This is my 9th car and by far the most enjoyable to drive. Build quality and attention to detail is superb. Only complaint is poor thigh and lumbar support.   Hard to Beat I\\'ve had this car for about a month and 600 miles. So far, it is awesome- handling, comfort, and power are amazing. I am excited and proud every time I get in it. It has made me re- think the numbers (i.e. horsepower) on paper. I don\\'t understand how something with \"only\" 211hp can be so fast. I also test drove the BMW 328IX and it didn\\'t feel anywhere near as fast as this car. I also love that I get such good gas mileage out of something with so much power. Safety is unmatched as well-5 stars in every category.   Premium Plus w/MMI I purchased a 2010 A4, Premium Plus with FrontTrak after testing driving many cars including BMW 328i, Mercedes C300, Lexus I250, Infiniti G37 and Lincoln MKz.  All cars I test drove were very good but the Audi A4 was the best in my opinion.  Audi A4 was the perfect blend of a beautiful exterior, high quality sports sedan with peppy engine performance with exceptional handing and a large, well appointed interior cabin with leg room. The last part was very important to me. I am 6\\x922\\x94 tall so I did not want to feel cramped inside the car. The A4 has more room than a BMW 328/MB 300/Lexus I250. The A4 is also a very good looking car. I receive many complements on its exterior and interior looks.  Amazing car I looked at the usual competitors; Lexus IS, Infiniti G35, BMW 3 series, and even a Nissan Maxima. I didn\\'t like the MMI system when I test drove it, but after one day it was easy and now I love it. The car has a perfect balance of performance and luxury. There\\'s enough space for my bigger friends, but has the design to make people look when I drive by. It\\'s good for someone with a family or a bachelor.  1st Audi I agonized over this decision like I never have before.  It came down to the 328i and the A4.  Both were within $3 per month after hard negotiating.  You cannot beat the BMW for in the way it drives.  It was amazing, BUT, there are so many other factors and it seemed like the A4 won every other one.  Quattro vs XDrive, the interior was far superior in the Audi (cup holders in the BMW were insulting), the way the Bluetooth and Ipod integrate so seamlessly, the ride comfort, and the list truly goes on and on.  Trunk space must be at least 2X in the Audi. What can be better? A4 2010 2.0 premium plus/sport package/Nav. This car got it all: Luxury, Style, Power, Technology and Fuel Efficiency. Love the turbo engine. Sport tuned make a big difference. Almost got a BMW 335i. NO regrets. Saved $12K and have everything I wished for. Fuel efficiency with such a performance is a big plus! Dealership much more flexible than BMW. Premium Plus w/ Nav / MMI and 18\" wheels Initial observations is that this vehicle is built with the highest quality standards and materials. I understand some complaints about the steering wheel not returning to center when coming out of a turn. This simply takes some getting use to. MPG on the first tank of gas has been 32 MPG combined (in spite of the suggested 27 MPG Hwy).  Lots of buttons and gadgets gives the feeling that you are truly sitting in the cockpit of an airplane. This was another complaint of Edmunds but I see this as a awesome feature. Performance is outstanding.  Lots of heads are turning when I drive by.  Build quality is a cut above my Infiniti FX35, but enjoy both vehicles. Handling is outstanding! First Audi I thought I was going to get the new maxima but on a whim I stopped by audi.  Also looked at the 328xi, TL, G37x and TSX. The BMW was great but over 100/month more.  Loved the old TL but the new one felt way too large.  Drove the TSX with the 4 cylinder too slow.  Like the 6 but it was a $5k option, nearly 40k in total.   As soon as I drove the A4 quatro I was hooked.  The interior is so far superior to the other vehicles.  The new maxima moves but it still feels really cheap.  I liked th G but it was over $75/month more.   The 6 speed manual is fantastic.  Easy to use, short throws.  Can\\'t wait to try the quattro in winter. Unreliable but good looking If you want a candy for an eye, this is a car for you. If you want a reliable vehicle, DO NOT buy Audi with 2.0T engine! To most people, adding oil every 1000 miles is a hassle but Audi will tell you it\\'s \"normal\". Google \"A4 oil consumption problem\" for more details on this issue. Audi A4 Premium Plus  I drove the Mercedes c-300, BMW 328i, and the Lexus is250 prior to making my choice. The ride was the most comfortable in the Audi A-4. It also has great handling that matches in comparison to the other models. This turbo is makes it more zippy than the v6\\'s in the comparison models. Drive this car before you choose one of the others.   One Sweet Ride So this is my first \"luxury\" car... 30 hours ago, I replaced my 2003 V6 Passat, that I dearly loved back in the day, with this new machine. I have to say, I didn\\'t fully realize what I was missing. First, the quality of the interior is outstanding. Second, the handling is truly awesome. This car wants to hug the inside of a sharp corner and is a joy to accelerate all the way through! No body roll, no rear end jumping out,  sheer bliss. Last, I love the technology, voice commands work well - lots of control over just about everything. B&O audio is outstanding. Didn\\'t even consider a BMW - no Beemer Nation for me!  OPTIONS: premium plus, 18\" sports package, navigation, b&o audio This is a FUN Car First of all, before I purchased the A4, I looked at the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes c class, Infinity and even Cadillac CTS.  I believe this is a typical sampling in this space.  I picked the A4 for the roomy interior (at least for a small sedan), torque and interior design.  It may not have the fastest top speed/acceleration in its class, believe me, with the torque, it\\'s good enough.  Love the interior and sound system.  It\\'s a fun car to drive. The Best Entry-Level Luxury Sedan I have owned four Audis and a number of other European cars and this one is the pinnacle so far. The build quality and choice of materials (inside and out)are segment leaders. The engine has unbelievable torque given its size and the ride is very compliant with minimal body movement. The steering is also sublime - it seems to know where you want the car to be pointed. This generation of A4 finally has real rear- seat space as well. Pleasantly Surprised Our Audi A4 has exceeded all our expectations.  The ride quality is outstanding and the handling in the snow/heavy rains has been phenomenal.  Although my wife is the primary driver, I love to drive the car on the weekends.  The ride is tight and although the speed sensitive steering takes some getting used to, it was rock solid at highway speeds.  This vehicle represents a great value compared to the competition. Nice luxury vehicle for the price, but... It could have been better. Lack of Auto dimming mirrors and memory seats on non Quatrro model is a joke. To get those two features, you need to go with a Quattro for an extra $2K (for automatic) and another $9K for Prestige option.  Steering wheel can be little more stiffer. It is too light that I constantly have to make adjustments while driving. When I\\'m on freeway, I go zig-zag. My girlfriend actually got motion sick due to it. I have an Infiniti which has a real stiff steering wheel, so it\\'ll probably take a while to get used to it.  Audi\\'s Multi Media Interface(MMI) is not very easy to use. It is located in the center console, so you need to look down while driving to change something. Amazing Car (Prem + w/ sport package) I must admit I have not had this car very long to date, but the fit and finish of this car is excellent. The engine power is adequate from the 2.0T base, but with aftermarket performance upgrades that are safe and relatively inexpensive this car can really be made to move.  I\\'m 6\\'2\\'\\' and interior fit is nice, sport seats are comfortable. Ride with the sport package is great and fuel economy thus far is about middle of the road. Highly recommend this car. Disappointed Just bought a new 2010 A4 with A/T. Found the steering too light and steering doe not return to neutral after a turn at normal speed. This requires more attention and correction from driver; making the car unpleasant if not unsafe to drive. Acceleration is acceptable, but fuel economy is bad. For 70% highway and 30% light local driving, I averaged only 21MPG. That\\'s what I get for my 05 V6 Accord. Also find the controls unfriendly and complicated to use.  My Baby This car has exceeded all of my expectations. I purchased it in the fall of 2008. The gas mileage is unreal: occasionally I will get 37 mpg on the highway (10 mpg better than EPA projected). I am 6 foot 6 inches and it feels like this car is tailored for me. My father fits at 6 foot 11 inches and he it works for him as well. The LEDs are a must, as I have gotten an innumerable amount of glances and BMW 3 series\\' wanting to race because of them. The Audi A4 is just as capable if not more so than the other cars with which it competes. The grip is unreal. And while other cars are sliding around on the ice, it drives just like it would on asphalt. This car is a dream. A well put together Machine Have had my new A4 for about 5 months and it is the best car I\\'ve ever owned.  I attended one of those Audi Driving experiences where they let you drive a Lexus, Mercedes and BMW, as well as the A4 and while the A4 wasn\\'t superior in every category, it was the all around winner (atleast for me)  Interior design is sleek and quality, exterior styling turns heads when I drive by. Fuel efficiency is off the charts, 24mpg city, and 33 highway, although I have taken a couple long highway trips and gotten 34-35mpg.  I will admit, Audi\\'s past quality issues made me think twice about buying. I hope reviews of this model were correct.  steering problem After a turn, the steering wheel does not return to \"straight\" properly (too slow) which makes driving a bit nerve racking and seemed unsafe. Changing continents Previously owned 2 Lexus GS models-the first was a rocketship, and the second a more desirable sedate sporting sedan.  The Audi is a lesser car but a more fun and  responsive car to drive and the 4 cylinder turbo is comparable to the 1st big engined Lexus I had-- much more road responsive.  I have the MMI-Navigation package and it is so-so.  Too many buttons, too many steps to do the basics.  Favorite stations--push radio, push presets, turn the MMI dial to your stations-- what ever happened to the push button.  Navigation--difficult, the Germans should look at touch screen.  Two cup holders, but one is too small to fit anything. Seats need a lot of tweaking to get the right fit. Best of the best Premium Plus 2.0T Quattro 6 sp manual- Love at first drive-or maybe even before that! I switched from a Subaru Outback 2.5XT which I loved, but this takes all prizes hands down.  My requirements- AWD, safe, solid & responsive handling. Shopped Sub, MB,BMW,Inf- Results: Best value. no contest. Incredible performance in sun, rain and snow, the manual shifts with control and grace.  Exceptional braking and handling, seats have tireless support and comfort without confining.  Comfortable for a family of four, but styled for a single executive.  love the B&O upgrade- highly recommended! I wish everyone could own one...the world would be a happier, safer place! Drive it, you\\'ll understand. Das Ist Audi The A4 quattro drives like it is on rails. The car reacts well and the road can be pleasingly felt. The A4 is appropriate to take business clients and passengers due to the large size and interior.  Exceptional vehicle! Due to inclimate weather in my area this year, it was perfect timing for owning this vehicle. The initial quality of this car is impressive. Clean, well thought out, and overall pleasing on the eyes. Everything you touch within the car feels great. I went with the manual option and since the car is so fun to drive, I don\\x92t believe I\\x92m getting the ratings suggested. I\\x92m sure if I wasn\\x92t to drive so aggressively, my MPG ratings would improve. The new A4 is larger, stronger, better looking, better MPG - than the BMW 3-series or C-class. I haven\\x92t owned it long enough to speak in regards to its reliability. Regardless, I think I made the right choice... Like it better every day Replaced my trusty \\'04 Acura TL, ended up with a Premium Plus A4. Wanted a sporty AWD sedan, and there aren\\'t many--cross shopped the G37X Infiniti and Cadillac CTS, but the Audi is so solid, well-executed and efficient (both size and performance) that even with higher overall performance the others didn\\'t compare.  I\\'ve never been in a car that feels more connected to the road in the dry, and in the wet or snow the thing tracks like a billy goat--on snow packed roads I\\'ve had a hard time getting it to break loose, even intentionally.  If the long-term reliability is there, this car is an absolute winner. Hands Down Winner Lease was ending on a 2007 A4, and looked at the BMW 328, Mercedes 350C, and G37 as well as the 2010 A4; This car had the best balance of performance / luxury relative to price of anything I looked at (I have the Premium Plus and Sport Package).  Don\\'t be put off by the 4 cyl turbo - driven in \"S\" mode the car has as much, if not more, acceleration as the others and is a blast to drive. I\\'m  looking forward to three great years with this one! Love this thing I\\'ve owned this car for a few weeks now and am pleasantly surprised. I sold a \\'07 Lexus IS250 to get my new A4 and was hesitant about the price upgrade to the premium plus package, but it has been well worth the money. The 2010 Audi A4 is hands down the best car I\\'ve ever owned. The ride is exceptionally smooth and the pick-up is outstanding. I get constant compliments on my A4 (mostly from the LED running lights) and I continually catch other drivers staring as I drive by. Although it feels much bigger than previous A4 models, the car handles with ease, gets great gas mileage, and is fun to drive. I shopped MB, BMW, and Infiniti and this was definitely the right choice. Great Car & Dealer, but Audi Corporate? The car looks and drives great. Handles as well as my former BMW 325xi and has exceeded my expectations. Only issue, minor, is defective mode switch on steering wheel but there are none in the country with ETA unknown. Availability of parts is the only concern I have at this point. 2007 A4 Cabriolet Quattro Purchased this car with 51k miles on the odometer and have been excited it drive it every single day. The unusually warm weather on the East Coast has allowed me to drop the top and enjoy motoring in this fine automobile. While I would never call the A4 Cabriolet a fast car, it is a fantastic cruiser. Step on the accelerator trying to merge into traffic and you will not be disappointed. Keep your foot on the floor and the car will hit triple digits and keep on pulling. The fit and finish are fantastic. When sitting in the car you easily forget that you are in a convertible. The ride noise is minimal (for a convertible) and the headliner looks like it belongs in a hardtop. Love it! Sure, it burns a quart of oil every 3-4,000 miles, but you only have to change oil every 10,000 miles so you\\'re still ahead. There is a lag with the turbo, but it really goes away when driving in \"sport\" mode, which I always do (VERY peppy, and still get 23mpg). I\\'ve had one small mechanical bug (rear window with a mind of it\\'s own) but my dealer (Rusnak, Westlake Village, CA) has been exceptional to work with. I\\'d love to trade it someday for an A5 cab, but at my age, they might end up burying me in this car! Greatest Car I\\'ve Owned I\\'ve owned my A4 for about 1 year now and couldn\\'t be happier.From the sporty ride, quick acceleration, incredible interior finish/comfort, wonderful Bose stereo, to the fact that I can fit four adults comfortably make this car a winner.I had driven several A4s before and liked the drive.I love it now.When I ride in a different car I miss the feeling of my Audi. Some people criticize the exhaust warble...that\\'s a plus in my book.I have no idea what some people mean referring to seat discomfort.I\\'m 6\\'2 and have driven across the US and felt great.Also, just yesterday I averaged 29-31 mpg on the highway at 75 mph.not too shabby. HELP!!!!!!!!!....\"TICKING\" NOISE - IT IS GOING TO BLOW UP????? I purchased my 2007 Audi A4 Convertible Quattro about a month ago, with only 39,000 miles on it.It is a great car, but with one exception, it \"TICKS\" after I power the car off.What I\\'ve noticed is that it when I drive a short distance, it\\'s a low faint ticking noise, and when I drive a long/extended period it is a high/loud ticking noise when I power off. Yes, I\\'ve been told that it is \"Normal\", but it is such a distraction from the beauty of the car, when the attention it\\'s receiving is due to the \"ticking\" noise it makes. Is anyone else experiencing this problem, and is there a fix for it. Please advise, as I feel that I am driving a \"TICKING TIME BOMB\"..... Dream car Traded in an old Sebring convertible for the Audi Quattro.  Wanted an all- weather convertible.  Couldn\\'t be more pleased. The car is absolutely beautiful on the outside, and has Audi\\'s workmanship and reliability. We\\'ve had it five months.  Absolutely no issues.  Inside, it\\'s fine for me; tight for my six-foot-one husband.  We were able to drive anywhere in one of the worst winters we had, and the top- down experience is fabulous.  It takes close to 30 seconds to get the top up or down, but you get used to that. It\\'s the only awd convertible on the market - I hope Audi remains committed. Noisy, Noisy, Noisy! Bought cabrio for my wife. Handsome car!  As owner of Lexus ES, this car is a lot of fun to drive. Quattro makes this car a real \"gripper\" on the road.  Low end torque a yawner. At higher speeds - a gem!  My biggest disappointment - engine noise. Sounds like a cheap Chevy Cobalt at idle. I have owned convertible Saab and Volvo with essentially same HP that had meaty exhaust w/little or no sewing machine engine noise.  The smell of burning oil Don\\'t do it! Don\\'t buy it! Please do a search on Oil Problems and you see a ton of them. It is a common problem and Audi has no intention of solving the issue. Don\\'t do it. I am so regretting buying this car. It looks great, but I so nervous about have to add oil every 1000 miles. Need to keep a quart in the trunk. First and last Audi I buy. Mixed Feelings So Far... I\\'ve had the car about 2 weeks now; purchased certified pre-owned, 16Kmi.   Pros: The car is fun to drive and I love the looks inside and out. The features are great too, especially the radio. The dealers I\\'ve dealt with have treated me like a rock star.  Cons: It does not ride smooth. You feel every bump. Flex is pronounced. The engine is also rough and noisy, especially at idle in drive. Gas mileage has not been up to par with my previous Saab 2.0T (23mpg vs. 28mpg).  Acceleration is also not as strong. The front seat is uncomfortable because the center console forces you to twist your body to reach the gas pedal. Reading issues on \\'net forums does not inspire reliability confidence. Love Hate I have a love hate relationship with this car.  It looks great, fun to drive, however it has been in the shop more than I care for a car of this caliber.  Like many other comments, this car burns the oil. Couldn\\'t choose any better I have been wanting the car for a while and had the hardtop A4, at the end of the lease nothing sounded better and I was right. Right after driving out of the dealership with 9 miles on the odometer I got plenty of looks on the street. The car, just like any Audi, drives beautifully, their windblocker assures your perfect hair day isn\\'t ruined. I love how fast the top closes and how little of my own work it takes to open/close it, just a touch of my finger. This car also does look great with the top up which is not a common thing for convertibles in today\\'s market.  Love the car but... Great car for driving around town.  Convertable is really fun and in the winter, quattro really gets you through.  One issue I have is that on a long trip, the driver\\'s seat becomes very uncomfortable to the point of painful.  I have had the pad replaced but it didn\\'t help. I use a towel on the seat for long trips.  Additionally, the german car makers need to upgrade their Nav system.  Toyota and Acura systems win by a mile! Couldn\\'t choose better. Wow! this is in one word what I can say about this car. Im the convertible type of woman and I previously had the bmw z4. After switching this car to Audi I don\\'t think I will ever go back to BMWs. I live in Las Vegas so sun is always here and the convertible just makes sense however from now on even if I live in Alaska I still wouldn\\'t mind having the same car. In the z4 i had to \"work\" on getting the top latched to the car and here I press a button and it does it all for me, and I mean ALL. Overall I love it and recommend it to anybody out there.  Fantastic Ride Only have 2000 miles in 3 months.  Visited the dealer on a whim after checking out Saab and VW Eos.  VW dealer had a used A4 on the lot. Big mistake. For about the same money as an Eos , I was able to lease a new A4 with Quattro. I feel the value of this car with all its luxury and fit n finish puts all others to shame in this class. It is a second car, so it doesn\\'t get its fair share of outdoor time. I can\\'t keep my eyes off it.  It turns heads on the road as well. The Alpaca Beige is really unique and looks great with the aluminum trim. Didn\\'t get all bells and whistles since inventory was limited. Stereo just ok. Convenience pkg is great as are 18\" wheels. Just put the top down and grin! Great Convertible I selected the wood trim instead of the aluminum. The car is very fun to drive, and Quattro is amazing. The fact that you can get it nicely equipped at about 46k is pretty nice too. I had the Premium and Convenience Packages, along with the Bose sound system. No MMI or Bluetooth. However, Bluetooth is pointless in a convertible if you have the top down. The wind deflector and heated seats are invaluable and they help you drive the car a lot later into the year. Digital climate control is standard, a nice touch over BMW or Mercedes. The CD player is an in-dash 6 disc. The changer moves to the glovebox if you get MMI. It also plays MP3 discs, which is handy. Another 3.2L New Engine Failure Couldn\\'t help but notice the earlier review about a new engine failure.  I brought my 2007 3.2 Cabriolet in for it\\'s 5000 mile service, and when a new engine noise appeared immediately thereafter on the passenger side, Audi replaced the engine, seemingly knowing what the problem was right away.  One of the cylinders had an obvious machining defect that the service department kindly showed me.  Audi should not saddle the consumer with this enormous market devaluation when an obvious quality control issue like this arises.  If you\\'re buying an Audi like I did, thinking I was smarter than all the other people who have nightmare stories to tell, perhaps think again.  Audi A4 convertible Have owned the car for 6 days and love it!  Went with FWD and CVT due to price -- wanted a convertible and this is a 3rd car that will not do heavy duty driving or commuting.  For general driving, the FWD is more than fine.  Engine is great with 2.0T -- peppy and efficient at same time.   Brother-in-law owns \\'05 1.8T Sedan - drove my 2.0T & says it\\'s much stronger from a standstill.   Upgraded stereo with Bose/Sirius is fabulous.  Interior fit/feel is intuitive, with lots of little features that make it a pleasure to drive.  Top up/ down process is painless and takes less that 30 seconds.   Overall, no regrets and the price was right, compared to a used 2006 BMW convertible. Nothing Like It This is my 8th leased Audi. Love the brand. The 3.2 Cab is a great car to drive. I\\'ve had Porsche and BMW convertibles and nothing can compare to the amazing roof this Audi has. It\\'s canvas, but virtually silent even when driving at 80 mph. I don\\'t know how the engineers did it, but wind noise is kept at a minimum. Handling is much better than the old cabs. It seems stiffer and the turn-in is quicker. Brakes are awesome and inspire confidence. Got it in Alpaka Beige, cream interior and tan room. It\\'s a very nice looking car, even with the new Audi gap-mouth grille. You get used to that fairly quickly. I highly recommend the 3.2. Just an exceptional joy to drive I have had this car for 4 months and every day I seem to find a new reason to like it better than the day before.  It is a beautifully refined vehicle and the interior along with the convertible top is a marvel.  The engine is smooth although maybe a little noisy and the 6-speed auto transmission is very refined.  I wish the gas mileage were a little better, but that is the compromise to have Quattro, I guess.  I have pretty much every available option and I think this is the reason the car is such a marvel... nothing to do but drive and enjoy. Budget Luxury! I\\'m rating this a 4.3 out of 5 Stars. This little car has been a joy since the day I bought it. I bought the car from ASE Auto inc in Studio City, CA earlier this month. The first thing I noticed about the car was how zippy and smooth it was. Everything seemed to be fine until I encountered a problem with reverse. I drive the automatic version of the car and they can develop some issues around 90-100k miles. The problem consisted of the car disengaging the gear if the RPM\\'s went up too fast. (Almost as thought he car slips into Neutral). My mechanic spoke to Sam at ASE Auto and he is fixing it for free. Other than that, there have been no issues with the car. As some of the other reviews say, the car does burn oil. You may notice some blue smoke from the exhaust when you first start it but it\\'s nothing to be concerned about. I carry a quart of oil with me just in case and I top off the oil every 1000 miles or so. All problems aside, this car is nothing short of luxurious. Mine has wood trim that accents the dashboard, leather seats that have very good seat warmers, a steering wheel that feels great in my hand and a very smooth ride overall. The rear is a bit cramped with little leg room if the front seats are back more than half way and but the hatchback gives you a lot of cargo space. The car\\'s technology is a bit dated but not obsolete. There is no aux jack or bluetooth but the sound system is just fine and the radio is very easy to use. The steering wheel also has a small dial that lets you raise and lower the volume with your right thumb and another one that lets you change the station with your left thumb. A big plus for me was not only Sport Mode but also Manual mode. The steering wheel has paddle shifters which are fun to use and good for keeping the car in a high gear when on a road trip (to save gas). There is a bit of a lag when using the paddles to change the gear but that\\'s normal for a car of that age. Gas milage is not bad for a German V6. I average 16 city and 23 highway but the car does need Premium gas so she\\'s an expensive date. She makes up for it in safety with a 9.6 out of 10 safety rating and airbags all around. The All-Wheel-Drive is also a bonus and keeps the car planted, even in very heavy rain. This car also shares many of its parts with Volkswagen so most parts will be very cheap. Overall, this car is definitely a good buy if you want a sporty and luxurious car that\\'s safe, reliable and relatively cheap. Bad investment Purchase vehicle at 55000 miles, had to replace the top because back window fell out. X 58000 the first ignitor went bad, @ 60000 the second ignitor went bad @ 63000 the third one went bad and I replaced the balance. At 65000 miles the rack and pinion seals went bad leaking oil how to replace whole system for $2200. So in the past year I had to spend $1500. For a new top, $2200. For a new rack and pinion steering system, $300 for igniters and $600 for tires. The total is $4,600 which I could have put on a new car. And the bad part was even though it was under a 30 day warranty the dealership would not even help covering the cost of the top or anything else. We have since gone to the Attorney General in Massachusetts to help the next guy not getting stuck by A supposing reputable Car Dealer. Beautiful oil burning machine This is a long term update (hey I feel like an Edmunds pro!).  The car is still fantastic to drive - its handling, acceleration and road holding are excellent. But it burns oil.  While I don\\'t know if this will affect the car\\'s functions, I will be turning it in at the end of the lease instead of buying out the lease. Also, for those not used to turbos, they have tons of torque in the midrange, meaning they are fast at 20-50 and 50- 75.  But they do have a slight hesitancy at low speeds, so if you are used to Toyota soccer mom vehicle where you blast off the line (then of course hold up the rest of the traffic later), this car is not for you.  love and mostly hate I have been leasing Audi A4\\'s for 13 year.  This car is a major problem. I only have 25,000 miles on the car in less than 3 years.  So far the master switch for the windows and the cruise control needed replacement. It burns oil.  The reminder light came on 10 months after an oil change.  Now it comes on after 5 months. I was thinking about buying the car after lease.  No Way Now.  The warranty is limited.  When it runs out I\\'ll be stuck with all the big maintenance bills.  I am going to put this car back on Audi and find a good used BMW 3 series. Satisfied After the First Year The A4 Avant is agile on the road and it\\'s a blast to drive. For the price, you really get a lot for your money. Most significantly, I feel firmly tied to the road during poor driving conditions. The sleek look of the Avant puts to rest the popular notion that wagons are boring and unsexy.       Tight design, grin-inducing performance After test-driving the 3.2L, I could not settle for the 2.0T. While the 2.0T is peppy, the 3.2 is brute-force power, but with a terrific handling finesse. The exterior lines are sleek and not overdesigned like some competitors *cough*BMW*. The interior is likewise sleek without the BMW austerity or Lexus frou-frou. The engine just purrs, and no matter what your speed, the 3.2 has plenty of power in reserve. The GPS is top- notch, the Bose system is pure concert- hall sound, and the overall design is classic. Amazing how a 10-year-old Audi doesn\\'t look nearly as dated as a younger Lexus, Merc or BMW. Most importantly, I took a broadside hit from a Dodge Ram and was fine.  Audi - 1, Dodge - 0. Rough Ride Great engine, handling, and transmission. Unfortunately, the suspension is so hard it transmits every bump and crevice from the road right to the steering wheel and cabin.  Makes for a \"nervous\" ride.  Truly unfortunate.  I feel like I need to see the chiropractor after every drive. I love this little car I\\'m big, the car isn\\'t, but all in all it is reasonably comfortable.  The AWD 6 speed 2.0 T gives me all the performance that I really need for Canadian winters and driving distances.  Mileage is excellent on the hwy in 6th and this car pulls well past the speed limit. I find the fit and finish as good as my previous bimmers but the car is more reliable than my recent X5\\'s and is actually better in the snow. I reccomend this car wholeheartedly - I always enjoy driving it! I love my Audi! Have had a number of German autos, our other car is a Porsche C4S and I bought the Audi as a utility vehicle and so far we are extremely pleased with the quality and performance of the car. Have also had BMWs in the past, the Audi is equal or better in all aspects and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a wagon for the utility benefit but still wants the style and luxury of a great German car! A4 Avant  = Awesome Ride My second A4 Avant and it is better than my 2003 was. Faster, better handling, great looking both inside and out. Better mileage and bang for your buck than any Benz or BMW out there. For $40k with most of the upgrades, this baby rocks. Black and beige is a babe magnet. Better than expected Performance is better than expected, quality and finish are outstanding. Multimedia/NAV is the best, only I would add touch-controls. I tried BMW 325xi. A4 is smaller, firmer, more fun to drive (and feels faster). Recommend A4 over the A3 (especially when you buy it with quattro) or A6 (boring...), since I had both for a while before.  10 years of ownership *10 years of ownership* after owning this car for almost 10 years I had decided to write a detailed review on my experience with this 2007 Audi A4 Quattro with the 3.2 engine. 0-80,000 miles absolutely problem free. During that one frame all that was done to the vehicle was routine oil changes (5,000 intervals as I do not personally think going 10,000 is a good idea), tires around 45,000 miles, I always use premium gasoline. 80,000-115,000: around 85,000 miles during service it was discovered that my valve cover gaskets were leaking oil that was around $250 with parts and labor. 95,000 miles I had all brakes replaced (pads, rotors on all four wheels) I ordered parts from Advance Auto Parts for $210 and still currently have them on the vehicle at 170,000 smooth as the Audi brand no need to pay for brand name very little brake dust as well. 112,000 miles I noticed that I could smell a burning oil. So I took it in to see what was wrong, the valve cover gasket appeared to be leaking again. So I had hen replace it once again. 115,000-145,000: no problems at all until 138,000 I noticed little drops of oil on my garage floor. I decided to take it in and was informed that my valve cover gasket looked like it was leaking again and that my rear main seal had a leak. At that point we figured that the actual valve cover itself may be warped. I decided to deal with the small drops of oil as I did not see it necessary to pay almost $3,000 to repair everything. I now have 170,000 miles on the car and it has never left me stranded. The key to keeping this car serviced it to find an independent mechanic that will treat you fairly. I see no need to replace this car anytime soon in the future. Great Entry Level Sedan A4 3.2 6MT This is a great car for city driving. Plenty of power and easy to handle. Living in Lake Mary, FL and dealing with a lot of out of town tourist you have to be able to react to slow and fast drivers. Like most cities with interstate traffic, a quick responsive vehicle is a must. The A4 with the 3.2L has the power to lane change and pass when needed. I also owned a 2012 S4 6MT and the less powered A4 is just as nimble, I didn\\'t say as powerful, but this little package gets the job done with fun. There are nice exterior modifications you can do to this car which really enhance the lovely design of the B7 series. I really enjoy this car and I think its a great sedan for those who enjoy luxury and spirited driving.  The only two things I dislike about the car is I wish it had a 22 gallon gas tank and could be a little quieter. It really is a smooth riding vehicle and I enjoy it a great deal.  I have owned BMWs, Chryslers, Corvettes, Porsches, and Volvos, and this Audi A4 is a superb automobile. Great Car!!  185K  I bought my A4 2.0T FWD new in \\'08.  It now has 185K miles and still has the original clutch. Maintenance has been: timing belt at 90K, engine hood piston (holds the hood up when open) and the normal - Tires, brakes, Headlights, taillights, battery, ignition coils.  The only thing that has ever broken is the latch on the center console.  I went from a 2001 Porsche 911 to the Audi (kids got to big to squeeze in the back) and while it doesn\\'t have the HP of the 911 it has been a fun car to drive with fantastic gas mileage.  Vegas to LA usually 32-33 MPG at 80mph+   Meltdown At around 120k miles I replace the timing belt.  The engine sounded more high pitched with a whining sound right aferwards.  Several thousand miles later the oil symbol started flashing and several blocks later the engine was toast.  The local garage it was towed to thought it was the timing belt.  Took it to the dealer and they said it was the oil pump.  When Consumer Reports says the A4 models have major engine problems I guess this is what they meant.  No satisfaction from the Audi dealer...only blame that I drove it several blocks befor pulling over. Multiple Expensive Failures before 100K Miles Purchased car just off lease at approx 52K miles.  Car was always maintained by dealer while on lease.My wife is the primary driver doing a 14 mile RT work commute. Car is maintained in accordance with (or more frequently than ) factory guidelines.Overall a great car to drive but (big but) the greatness is negated by the following repairs performed by an Audi dealer:Factory piston tolerance defect resulting in excessive oil consumption.  Repaired at Audi\\'s expense (not the case for all A4 owners) only after repeated inquiries to dealer and Audi USA. Turbo failure @ ~ 74K miles  (>$1K)Transmission Leak @70K miles (o-rings around cable plug)  (~$700)Exhaust system union clamp inexplicably split (not due to physical damage and not a routine repair item - part not available for 4 days)Thermostat @ ~ 80K (>$700) (had to replace whole water pump assembly)Dashboard LCD panel failure @~80K miles (~$900)The above is in addition to all of the routine maintenance (oil changes, filters, battery) performed by an Audi dealer always at a premium (or borderline ridiculous) price.In summary - \"hugely disappointed\" in the repair frequency, types of failures, and related expense for a supposedly well-engineered car. Audi low oil-Warning light I bought Used Audi A4-2.0 issues right from get go..low oil 1 quart. Took car to Audi dealer they inspected it for me. Everything looks great! 9500 miles later check engine light comes on. Take to Mechanic to run code. Code is saying belt slippage. Took to dealer right away. Waterpump, timing belt replaced. Noticed timing not correct still so they tore valve covers off, replaced timing chains and tensioners. Found debris in screens around cam gear. Found debris in oil pan from oil filter? Changed oil with only synthetic oil every 3000 miles so i dont get it?I am out $2500.00 dollars still and car in shop still with timing problems? Done with AUDI buy a BMW with timing chain and dependable. Oil Consumption issues resolved This is for all consumers having Oil Consumption issues. I purchased my 07 A4 used with 54,500 miles on it.Right away I noticed the oil consumption problem.I tracked the consumption for about 10,000 miles and made sure the dealership knew the mileage everytime I had to put another qt in.The light was coming on down to just less than a 1000 miles to add a qt.I paid the out of pocket expense and the test came back that there was an issue.Audi Corp covered 85% of the repair and the dealership I purchased from, Elk Grove Audi, covered the remaining balance.Audi replaced the Piston rings.I now have close to 8000 miles since replacement and holding strong. Added 1 qt at 5000 mi. Fantastic after 112k miles I bought my A4 new in July 2007 and I have NEVER had an issue with it after 112k miles.Sure it burns oil a bit, but keep a quart in the trunk and your good to go.This is a car that is fun to drive and built solid.The only complaint I have is the glove box hing broke and they wanted hundreds to replace the whole thing...not me...I went and bought a 2 dollar hinge at Ace Hardware and screwed it in and it works great.I hope to keep my A4 for many years to come.  Massive and frequent transmission failures A more detailed report of my experience has been posted on NHTSA.GOV.The first transmission failed and was replaced under OEM warranty by an authorized Audi dealer at 36,120 miles. It continued to have mechanical issues such as shuttering, vibration, hesitation, leaks, etc. The 2nd transmission failed at 55,600 miles (less than 20,000 miles on the \"new\" transmission) while on the freeway traveling at 70 MPH. It occurred without warning. The car shifted into park, bucked and refused to accelerate. The 3rd transmission was installed under the Audi Pure Platinum Protection service, and after only 1,000 miles on the \"new\" transmission. it is showing signs of failing again.  Great car for enthusiasts only I bought this car knowing that maintenance might be an issue, and that it would need a lot of care.Luckily, I didn\\'t buy it because it was known for reliability or even performance.I bought it because I love Audi, and I\\'ve never regretted it.This car has the potential to become an amazing vehicle with some tweaks and some serious attention.If you want a car that you can drive and never have to think about then DON\\'T buy this car.This car needs to be loved.If it is worry free driving you\\'re after, then buy a Hyundai, Nissan, or Honda.This is for people who love tuning, and love cars.  My First Audi I was searching for something fun to drive since I spend so much time behind the wheel for my work. Looked at RX-8, BMW 3-series, Mustang, and Audi. My brother-in-law and his wife told me test drive one. Test drove an 07 A4 CVT 2.0T and fell in love.Gets good-great gas mileage given performance, good trunk space, great cabin layout, and long list of accessories.Have only had for awhile but I love to drive it. Small turbo lag in Drive, but put in Sport or Manual and it becomes virtually non-existent. Used to drive a Honda Civic and it doesn\\'t even compare. I know Honda\\'s are more reliable and require less maintenance, but just keep up with it and this car will take care of you.  110,000 miles I have had a couple of smaller issues. Oil has been ok but as they car ages it uses more. 1 quart every 4-5K at 110KPCV console latch and poor leather trim with leather cracking twice. Tires last 50K or more 30MPG or more.Brakes - fronts replace at 93k orginal rearTurbo diverter valve went at 93KCruise control brake switch at 85KTiming belt replaced at 105KAll in all it has not been bad as nothing mechanical went until it had >85kcoil packs replaced as part of recall. The car has done well for it\\'s class. It\\'s a daily driver with economy, comfort, and style.  Love it -- BUT the Oil!!! Love this car. I bought it as a certified pre-owned - I\\'ve had it about 1 1/2 years now.Love driving it BUT about every 1000-1200 miles the oil light goes on and I have to constantly put oil in.I have never heard of such a thing before.AUDI tells me that is normal for this type of \"high performance\" vehicle.I think NOT --- I still love the car but I don\\'t think I would have bought it if I knew this. Loved this car, until I realized it has a serious oil consumption problem which Audi has been dismissing for 2 years. Loved this car, enough that I purchased it off the lease after 3 years.Biggest mistake ever.I have been bringing it for oil consumption problems since Oct 2009 and been more than casually dismissed after wasting a lot of time and worry.Past 3 times I have burned more than a quart of oil after driving only 600-700 miles.Audi keeps giving me the run around (Fletcher Jones Audi Chicago has consistently given me the worst customer service of my life).They keep making me bring it back for oil consumption tests which have been repeatedly performed and telling me there is nothing wrong with it.I am at a loss and have written to Better Business Bureau and the Audi USA customer service. Feeling a bit worried ... Ok, here is the scoop - I love my 2007 Audi A4 Quatrrrrro ... fun to drive, great fuel economy and a definite head turner ... I bought is used with 50K miles August of 2010 - and I just got my check engine light January 2011.Initial symptoms were engine misfire (temp outside was -11 F ccooooold) ... so I took it to the dealer I bought it from and they had to replace some valve because of fault $257 later, it was deemed OK ... this happened after putting 10K miles ... and I was hoping to expect such events after 40K or so ... This is why I am a bit worried - what is going to go wrong again?  Gave back to dealer 2 mos before lease end.  Tonight I\\'m reviewing 6 of my latest car purchases. Audi is getting the lowest marks. My car burned a Quart of oil every 3000 mi.Oil light would come on before it was time to get oil change. Evry time. Loved car before this happened. Recommended A4 cabby to a friend. His did the same thing. When in parking lots examine the carbon buildup on A4 tailpipes.having blown the engine on my previous 911 I was very sensitive to oil lights. I complained repeatedly to Audi who insisted that kind of oil loss was within specs. Seems like poor engineering. I always felt like a chump after speaking with service. I was so annoyed that I gave it back early to clear a space for a new BMW. Cont.  Find me a few tires I bought the car brand new after trading in my 325i. I love the Quattro, but I cant keep tires on it. Discount tire tells me that the alignment is always out. No matter where I take it, I still have problems. Pep Boys blames the tires and Discount blames Pep Boys. It\\'s really frustrating. The car does have some Turbo lag but not all the time. It usally happens when you catch a stop light turning from red to green and you stomp on it. It doesn\\'t happen all the time and I don\\'t believe its dangerous like a few reviews state. The car is zippy and loves the highway. I cruise at 100 mph no problem through Arizona. I will sometimes put extra oil in it between changes, no reason to complain. Fun to Driver Love my car, not entirely perfect but so much fun to drive, I had problems with the window and sunroof but took it to the dealer and fixed it with no problem. Car stops on a dime. The breaks are amazing. Slow off the line but once the turbo kicks in its a pretty quick car. Handles really good as well. Lots of room in the trunk. Not too roomy in the backseats though. Also burns through a lot of oil but it doesn\\'t bother me to much just no your going to need a new quart every 2500 miles. All in all though I love this car Acceleration lag is a SAFETY WARNING I have LOVED this car, when going up hills. Its acceleration and cornering are beyond compare. But, when pulling out from a stop sign, or merging into traffic, it is downright dangerous! There is a lag between the time I accelerate and the actual time the car decides to move. Audi says the car adjusts to the driver and his/her habits to improve gas mileage. I cannot sacrifice safety for gas mileage. I cant count the number of times my A4 would not get up and go. Before having this Audi I had never experienced this type of problem. I cannot in good conscience recommend an Audi to anyone who wishes to remain alive. Research before buying - Burns Oil I love the Turbo, love the car. However I have 1 very large issue. It burns oil, as you can read in others reviews and if you search the web this thing drinks oil and Audi says it is normal and will do nothing about it. I too carry a quart in the trunk and keep a case in the garage. I have had the consumption test done, however 1 quart every 1,-1,500 miles is acceptable (for Audi). Even service guys at the 2 Audi dealers I get my car serviced at admit it is a fairly common complaint but they are not authorized to do anything. Not every car has this problem, but Audi is not doing everything it can to retain loyal buyers who have bad ones. I am sad that I will never buy an Audi again. Great car Great quality. You can feel it the moment you get in and start the car. After test driving Acura and Benz and Volvo and Lexus they all feel cheap and flimsy in comparison to the Audi. Just a great well thought out and very very well built car.  Never again Audi, Never again Paul Miler I have owned many cars in my life. the experience of driving this car was great for about the first two weeks. Then the car slowly but steadily started to break down. Taking it to my servicer was useless because it always seemed to be my fault or wear and tear. The tires failed, the oil leaked, the coils have been replaced countless times because the head gasket is apparently bad. To top it all off the clutch went because audi sub out to an Asian company so they could get it cheaper. It was all plastic. The car was made very cheap and for some reason the transmission and engine were two different times between 2006, 2007, 2008. coincidence i think not. Great Car Exterior is sharp! Love everything about the car, except: the somewhat cheap looking center armrest in the front seat that looks slightly out of place, the lack of leg room in the rear and the slight turbo lag on taking off from a dead stop. Besides these, I love this car. Good car Bought this from Carmax with about 29k on it. Had it mostly a year here in Atlanta. Got the 2wd 6 spd manny with S- line interior. Great car but I agree with everyone on the turbo lag issue. If I\\'m driving in rush hour in a 20 mph lane and want to merge into a 40 mph lane -- I sweat a bit. This car doesn\\'t seem to have that low-end acceleration one requires to dart in and out of traffic which is unfortunate because the A4 handles so well. I\\'ve gotten more than a few \"birds\" as I merge into traffic in 3rd and watch the RPM go soaring and the speedo move nary a tick as the drivers behind me hit their brakes. I may try to wind it up more in 2nd, but it doesn\\'t seem one should drive on the highway. Sold on Audi This has been a great car for me.  I bought it used as a CPO 2 years ago.  I have to add 1/2 quart of oil just before my oil change, not a big deal for how great this car is.  This car has great visibility (minimal blind spots).  No repairs needed so far on this A4.  I definitely recommend this car! This car will cost you your sanity!! I loved the speed and the handling of this car. I say \\'loved\\' because I traded it in at a loss.The reliability of this car? Close to zero.Started with brake lights,replaced 3 times.The oil consumption is beyond ridiculous,to the point I had to carry extra oil in the trunk for every 1300- 1500 miles!4 ignition coils replaced. Then the fuel pump sensor stranded me on an exit ramp, car would rev but not move an inch!Prepare for $100+ oil changes in ADDITION to fixing the things they say are \\'normal.\\'This car will cost you your sanity,your money and possibly safety.I am so disappointed in Audi,if they cared they would address the issues,not say it\\'s \\'normal! NEVER again would I buy AUDI! N-E-V-E-R! buyer beware I wish I had researched my certified preowned 2007 Audi A4 2.0T before buying in 8/09. Have been to the dealer once for a check engine light and twice for burning through oil every 2000miles. On top of that, the rear seat squeaks like crazy, and I\\'m unhappy with the \"turbo lag. And the best part is...these are all \"normal\" Beware of Oil Consumption This is a great car, in principle. Fun to drive, decent gas mileage, great design and quality of workmanship - all what you would expect. What one would not expect is the oil consumption: the 2007 A4 2.0T engine\\'s \"normal\" oil consumption is one quart every 1200 miles. Yes 1,200, not 12,000. I have had my car in the shop multiple times for this but Audi claims this is normal. They register my concern, find some faulty engine parts they replace but then send me on my way without fixing anything. So if you buy this car, be ready to drive around with a case of oil in the trunk. Don\\'t buy this car! Traded in my BMW for the A4 2.0T.  Big mistake!!!  The A4 is ho hum boring to drive, no power, can\\'t handle a turn, biggest mistake I ever made buying the A4.  Audi is dreaming if they think their A4 2.0T compares to a BMW ride. I\\'m miserable with the A4.            New Transmission When we test drove the vehicle we did not notice the hesitation when accelerating from a stop.  Mainly because we did not encounter any situation where we needed to hurry into or across an intersection.  After purchase and we began to drive the vehicle under normal conditions the hesitation was scary.  The engine RPM was increasing but the car was not going.  The dealer told it that it was the \"new transmission\".  Therefore, nothing has been done to correct the problem. Pretty junky for such a renowned and expensive car.  Month later the radio dies and the replacement is junky. Fantastic car, minor niggles After driving this car fairly hard and accumulating about 37,000 miles, I can honestly say it has been a great ride. The tires will wear down very fast if you push them hard - I had to replace my first set after just 10 months. Also, rear legroom is tight and I suggest changing the oil every 4,000 miles contrary to the dealer-recommended 10,000 mile interval. Wish the exhaust note was a little more inspiring too. Tires can squeak easy if pulling into traffic fast and ride can be a bit crashing on bad surfaces. Stability control is excellent and has saved me on multiple occasions from slipping off the highway ramps! Most important is how beautiful the car looks too! Very Pleased Overall I opted to purchase the A4 after comparing with the BMW 3 series (325) after test driving both and am still very pleased with my choice. The suspension is very tight providing a fun yet comfortable drive and the acceleration is satisfactory due to the turbo. I would love more power, but this is something you must pay for, and for the price, I feel very satisfied. Like other reviewers, I have had the issue of burning through oil, going nearly dry between changes and the issue of squeaky brakes also reported. I also think that the internal dash readouts and controls both aesthetically and ergonomically could use improvement, even compared to VW. Overall, I still love the car.  Bad 2.0 FSI Motor Owning an Audi has its highs and lows just as any other make out on the road. I have had some fun with my 2007 A4, it is very comfortable for all types of driving. Unfortunately, the FSI motors that Audi drops in these cars are garbage. Power is fine, handeling is impeccable, solid running motor, but HUGE OIL ISSUES. In most of the A4\\'s FSI motor, the rings around the pistons are bad causing oil to burn rapidly right out of your exhaust. Just look at your tailpipes and you will see what I\\'m talking about. If you look at all the other Audi vehicles, only the A4 has this problem. If you are changing your oil every 1500-2000 miles contact Audi USA for your Engine Replacement. Awesome Minus I just got the car about 5 months ago.  It\\'s been great and everything, it drives great.  The engine is kind of noisy... The muffler tips get black quickly no clue why.. Mine is automatic.  It\\'s fun to drive comfortable and everything.  When coming to a stop and it\\'s about to downshift from 3rd to 2nd the car shakes. Also turbo lag at start. Wish it had just a little bit more power.  But it\\'s enough.   2007 A4 Quattro 2.0-Fantastic Just bought a 2007 A4 Quattro 2.0 used with 18K miles in excellent condition.  The car performs like no other car I have had.  First, handling & ride are excellent.  Fuel economy has been 22 MPG on short trips and around 30 on longer trips.  The seats (both leather and power) are very comfy and the interior is very well assembled.  Only complaint is the short leg room in the rear seats, but since the kids are no longer at home, it will only be used occasionally.  (HINT: If you raise the front seat slightly, you can move the seat forward enough to allow more space for rear leg room. There are 2 trip computers,which were hard to use, but after reading the manual it makes sense. (See below.) Power Window Controls and Other Stuff I\\'m constantly having to fool with power window controls. So sensitive it either goes all the way down or all the way up hard to get it right where you want it.  Arm rest design is poor and blocks access to cup holders and hand break.  Eats oil like there is no tomorrow. Performance is great. Nearest dealer 1 hour away which is a drag.  Great car but ...squeaky brakes? Bought my first pre-owned Audi after owning Lexus IS-looking for better mileage.  Brakes squeak at low speeds - had them cleaned to remove carbon build- up but week later same problem.  Haven\\'t called the dealer back - anyone else have this problem?  Burning Oil I have to take my car in every 1500 to 2000 miles to have oil put in because the car is burning the oil so fast. This is my 3rd Audi and I purchased this one under the assumption it would be like my others, oil change every 10,000 miles, I was wrong. The dealership keeps telling me this is normal and I don\\'t believe them. I\\'ve contacted a lawyer because I want my car fixed before it goes out of warranty and find myself needing to replace a $10,000 engine. Best Car I\\'ve Owned I recently bought an 07 A4 Quattro after comparing several other brands. The build quality, gas mileage and AWD were a no brainer. The car is quiet, fuel efficient and fast! The turbo four is a great engine. Solid performer It was a toss up between the A4 and BMW 3 series.  I went with A4 as the interior is superior (in my opinion).  So far, no regrets.  Good power, handling and fuel economy.   All said, I would buy another Audi without hesitation. A Comfortable Choice Driving my A4 is both comfortable and fun.  It is especially nice on the freeway when you can slip it into 6th gear and just cruise.  It\\'s acceleration from a stop is a little slow, but once you get going, it accelerates quite nicely. Fantastic Bang for the Buck! I have been driving BMW\\'s for the last 16 years, but just purchased a pre-owned 2007 A4; the tight ride, the excellent gas mileage, and the bang-4-the-buck were the overriding factors influencing my decision. This is my first front-wheel drive car, which has taken a bit to get used to; other than that, I am still satisfied with my decision. Best Car I\\'ve Ever Owned This is the complete package. Fun to drive, beautiful interior, great in any weather, zippy. What more do you want in a car this size? Love this car This A4 is my second Audi (first was a 1997 A4). Audi has definitely stepped up their game. I drive a lot and am currently at 53,000 miles and have not had 1 problem. Consistent 31 MPG even with driving at 80 MPH. Highly recommended!  Thumbs down on the A 4 3.2 Sedan I have been real disappointed with the A4 3.2 CVT. I had 3.0 Quattro before and there is no companison. Quattros are what Audi is all about. The CVT transmission is jerky in the 3.2. It is a boring ride. I once tried to accelerate and had a delayed response. It is fast and comfortable but I plan to get rid of it and go back to a Quattro.  Audi 2007 rocks Had my Audi for a year now and very pleased. Car is governed for 135. Rides well and can get 36 mpg at 60 mph. Around town if you go 47 mph it is easy to get 32 mpg. Wish I looked at Audi earlier Bought an 07 BMW 328i and got out of it 2 months later. I can\\'t believe how cheap BMW has become and those run flat tires are pure junk. I never drove an Audi until a friend recommended and kept telling me to drive the A4. This thing is solid, tight and drives amazing! The Bose system is nice, but all the speaker and Bose amp are going and being replaced with much higher end speakers and keeping the head unit. Audi is definitely the ultimate driving machine. BMW, I defect! My Perfect Car We have the s-line package with the firmer suspension, 18 inch wheels and upgraded leather. I absolutely love this car. We had a 2003 3.0 litre A4 before and we stuck with Audi (instead of buying a 335 BMW) because they are such a great company to deal with and their engineering is beautiful inside and out. I wasn\\'t sure if I wanted the 6 speed manual until I drove it and loved it. It is awesome fun up in the mountains and the gas mileage is way better than our previous automatic. Also no one beats the Audi interior for the money. It is better than my buddy\\'s brand new $90,000 BMW 650i interior. It is an incredible car for the money. Great fuel economy and seat comfort Bought the A4 6500 miles ago. Seats are amazing, you never need to stop on long trips only adjust lumbar on long trips. Fuel ecnomy is excellent but it requires premium as expected with a turbo. AWD combined with winter tires makes this car the best I\\'ve driven in extreme winter conditions. Consumer reports rates this a recommeded buy, one of the main reason I purchased it. Traditionally pre-05 audis were not nearly a reliable. My previous car was an acura RSX, a more reliable (I am told) car but not nearly as nice of handling or design. I only hope this car will be as problem free as my Acura was, but I am not counting on it. This is the price paid for nicer handling and design. Dont Buy an Audi Several issues with the vehicle  1)  Engine Noise - the car sounds like a diesel. Not Quiet it will bother you.  Dealer says that is the injectors 2)  Brand new Car that burns oil according to Audi corp the engineering tolerances allow for a quart to be burned every 1200 miles -  All I can say is WOW.  This is a serious problem that will cause engine failure in the Future 3)  The HID Lights vibrate.  Taken in on several occasions there is an NTSB release on this safety issue.  AUdi wont do anything about it till someone dies.  4) Poor Value. Poor Resale Value.  5) TURBO LAG . . . . Turbo Lag.  Step on the Gas Pedal and count 2 missisippi.  God forbid you need to quickly accela Sweet! I\\'ve been eyeing and dreaming of driving this car for 7 years, you hear me, 7 years! Solid performance, nice handling,  luxurious interior, a product of real German engineering. Really does well on turning on sharp curves, it hugs the road. You name it, rain, snow, ice, it\\'s there, 4 seasons in a year! Yeah, it gets bored in the summer. Good car, but not worth the price After owning a 2007 A4 for just over 1 year, I can firmly say that it is a really nice car, but definitely not worth the sticker price of 37K. I have a couple of issues (car stalls for 2-3 seconds while cruising) that the dealership can\\'t fix. I have a couple of rattles that really shouldn\\'t exist in this caliber vehicle. I got a great lease deal 400 a month / 15k a year / 24 months with nearly nothing down. It is fun to drive. It\\'s fairly fast for the base engine. The mileage is good, but varies alot between city and highway. Just a super car... I recently bought my second Audi. This one is an 2007 A4 that I bought as a CPO with 12G KMS. It has a sport suspension with 17 in. MAGS. It is a great combination of style, comfort and driving performance. The 2.0 FSI has a bit of turbo lag in automatic mode but is way less noticeable than in the 1.8T. Frankly, it is no big deal as it is not very apparent and basically disappears in manual mode. Interior is second to none and the handling is crisp and clean. In the process of contemplating this purchase, I have tried out all the competition and came back to Audi because they put everything into one great package. Horrible junk I purchased a new A4 Quattro. On the way home the ESP light would intermittently stay on, the dynamic headlight warning light came on and stayed on. The cruise control did not work, the next morning I pulled out of the garage and began driving to work, the same thing happened and got worse, the turn signals would not work as well, very poor car, I have immediate glitches, hassles, embarassment (pulled up at starbucks with co-worker in car and had to open the door to get the order) and this is all on the original tank of gas. Never Follow This is my second A4 and I fell in love all over again.  Just like I did when I purchased my first Audi in 2002.  These cars are made to last and are only a few dollars more than a loaded-up Camry!  I chose this time to forgo Quattro as my previous A4 Quattro \"ate tires for breakfast.\"  I\\'m very happy with the FrontTrack.  The 2.0 turbo is almost as fast as my 2002 3.0 and gets MUCH better fuel milage: 32 hwy and 28/29 city.  I would reccommend Audi to anyone seeking a safe, efficient, quality auto that provides the driver with the cachet of a German luxury make without breaking the bank! Exceeds expectations The turbo 4 is plenty with the manual transmission, and I average 31 mpg in mostly highway travel.  Handles great.  No problems.  Feels solid.  Over 6000 miles so far. Replaced the SUV ;-)  After driving an ML320 for the past eight years, it was a big decision to return to a sedan.  We looked at, and drove, many of the SUVs and cross over vehicles but weren\\'t happy with the fuel economy (nor the cost) so we started driving sedans.   We bought the A4 because of its proven AWD system in the NE winters.  We have 9000 miles on it so far and it\\'s been great.  We average 28 mpg, the driving is great fun and it\\'s very responsive on curves, etc.   The quallity of engineering is impressive and the service (for the 5k oil change) quick and friendly.  Great little car!  First German Made car Bought my first German made car. Almost bought a ford fusion but when I really sat down and saw the better engineering, beefier parts, and the technology on this vehicle, the difference easily went away from the v6 opponent. All I can say is I got 36 mpg at 65 mph. 32 driving slow ~45 mph in stop and go traffic around town. Vehicle kicks with the cvt which you can make drive like a regular transmission, but that burns more fuel and well you don\\'t need it. The Little Car That Could... After months of research, I dismissed the following cars: Saab 9-3, Volvo S40, Infiniti G35, Acura TSX. It came down to the Acura TL and the A4. I bought the A4 because of the ride and I got it for $3K less than the TL. The car is fast, but watch out for turbo lag from a standing start. The quality of build is terrific. I\\'m getting 30 mpg with 70% hwy driving. The trunk is surprisingly spacious, but a little tight for the driver\\'s right leg. Get the premium package (with leather seats). Great fun all around! An amazing car to drive! I love my new Audi. It is really fun to drive and very comfortable. I also feel that it is a very safe vehicle for me and my family. I love the in-dash 6 disk changer and the body style of it. When I drive past people they know that the looks impressive.  You Get What You Pay For I shopped all the brands in this price point, thought the BMW was too small and cramped, thought the Lexus was just too boring, and the MB a little too \\'old\\'.  I  like the ride, handling, mpg, price and stereo in this car.  The price came in under all the competition and the complementary maintenance was very nice. However, I have not been able to enjoy it since out of the first 39 days of ownership, it\\'s been in the shop for 23 days.  I don\\'t know if I got a lemon, or this is indicative of Audi quality. Either way, I do not recommend this car and I won\\'t be buying from Audi again for a long long time. What I think of my A4 This is one great car. I love how agile it is. Handling is superb and it is a pleasure to drive the car. This car personifies how a true German sports sedan is supposed to feel and ride. The cabin is beautifully designed and the exterior is stylish and curves are eye catching. The mileage I get from this car is phenomenal. The only two things I would like see improved are, the turbo lag and leg area is slightly tight where a bit of wider floor would increase the comfort.    I am Surprised!!! I recently bought the A4 2.0T CVT; previously I had an A4 2001, 2.8 V6. I liked that car a  lot, but this new one is more powerful. Even though is 4 cyl, it has 10 HP more than my previous V6. Exterior and interior design is awesome. I got 6 years 100000 miles of warranty (for certified cars only), so I can drive non-stop and have fun. The only thing that my old car has the advantage over the new one is a silent engine noise, I believe it because of the turbo. I like more silent powerful engines, but otherwise everything is just excellent! AAA+++   Great Car! I\\'ve owned three VWs before this and so far I\\'m in love with the A4. I miss the power off the line from the VR6 engine in the VW\\'s I drove, but this is my first turbo and part of it is a personal adjustment. Would I purchase one again, if I had the choice? Yes. I love the way it handles, the ergonomics and interior design are excellent, and the build quality is top notch.  I only wish that I had an S4 or an RS4. It leaves me with something to wish for, but that\\'s not a bad thing. The Best Kept Secret In The Auto World The A4 can justify the price and gives the owner a sense of exclusivity. I wanted a sensible economy car, and that\\'s exactly what I got.  It\\'s not overly fun to drive, doesn\\'t have drop-dead good looks, but it is reliable, has excellent fuel economy, and the fit and finish set the standard. The Audi is an all around good car, and I have never second-guessed myself for purchasing one.   Satisfied After 9 years and 150K miles (8 1/2 years and 142K miles with nothing but routine maintenance) it was time to retire my 98 A4 2.8.   Audi, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti were all on my list to consider.  The Audi turned out to be the best all-around vehicle and as I mentioned has proven to be ultra-reliable at least for me.  I love the 3.2\\'s growl and pick-up. I LOVE THIS CAR! I recently purchased a 2007 Audi A4 2.0T six speed with the sport package. This car is simply awesome!! There is virtually no turbo lag. The acceleration is simply breathtaking. It is hard to believe that this car has only has 200 hp. It feels more like 250 hp. The six speed will do 0-60 in 6.5 secs (but feels even faster when the temp outside is between 40 -50 degrees - turbos like cool weather). The passing acceleration is equally impressive. Just drop down a gear and whoosh, the turbo blasts the car forward leaving other cars in your wake. I am also impressed with the handling capabilities of the A4. Many of the components of the sport suspension are borrowed from the S4 and it shows. German Engineering  Words alone cannot describe the artwork this car is. From the moment you sit in the car you feel comfort and to the point of making turns at 60 mph you still feel the ground which gives you believe in the car you trust it in the most severe time, and it doesn\\'t let you down. 4 cylinder engine, great on gas especially now that will hit $4 a gallon, and does not compromise power. 200 hp is quite enough. The interior, as always, high quality. I would say so-so This is a great car, but it does have a few problems.  The biggest problem so far is the fuel economy, granted I live in NYC, but 230 miles to the tank still seems like a bit much for a manual transmission being carefully driven. Now the fun part, at 4,953 the check engine light came on and as I soon found out, the oxygen sensor was broken.  This would have to be the first time I have ever had anything break at 5,000 miles, and needless to say I was not pleased. Still pretty happy with the car though, an overall pleasant drive. Audacious Audi! Did my research... Audi A4 wins in most categories: fun to drive yet economical; great design aspects, but not too cutting-edge; very comfortable ride, and of course, excellent German engineering throughout.  It\\'s damn good looking, too!     I love my brand new Audi I just recently bought my Audi, and I am extremely satisfied. I love the car; how it runs, performs, handles, everything. Style, Quality and Fun Fun Fun Very satisfied with my new \\'07 A4 3.2Q S-Line and titanium pkg. I\\'ve received glowing remarks on the Quartz metallic exterior and most people \"get\" the smooth quality interior. I\\'ve got the Navigation system with Sirius radio and enjoy every minute in this fun to drive rocket. As many have mentioned, the 3.2 engine has serious pull and the suspension keeps the car hugging the curves. The seamless bluetooth technology is just another added creature comfort, so is the MP3 compatibility. Love this car! Audi 2.0T Quattro 6M I\\'ve purchased this vehicle about a week ago.  I was also looking at Acura TL, Infiniti G35, and Lexus IS 250 as well.  In my opinion, Acura had the best quality and price.  However, Audi was much more fun to drive and has AWD feature which is very helpful for me (I live in Boston).  I am satisfied with my vehicle.       Engine Failed After 4500 miles, the engine on my A4 developed a knock on the passenger side.  Audi has replaced the air pump, ECU, and is now replacing the cylinder head.  I am concerned that such a new motor has failed, and that Audi has instructed the dealer to break it open and repair it rather then replace the motor or vehicle.   Excellent Follow-up I just turned-in my 2004 A4 1.8T UltraSport (5-speed manual) and am very excited. I decided to go for CVT this time, and with a few less options. This car does not disappoint, it looks great, drives great, etc. Fun to drive I have had this car two months and I love driving it.  This car is really nimble and comfortable.  The gas mileage is pretty good for a car that performs this well.  There is a slight lag at take off but then it really picks up.  Also, the car beeps way too much.  For the money this is a great car.   Love my A4 A long time Benz owner - drove the Audi on a whim and fell in love! I had forgotten how much fun driving could be - this thing rides like it\\'s on rails! Bought it as a 2nd car to keep miles off my ML350 and have to force myself to drive the SUV now.  Near perfection! With the new 3.2 A-4, Audi has designed, in my opinion, the BMW-killer. This car outdoes the 3-series in three important categories of performance, appearance, and overall value, with handling being a tie. I\\'m so glad I kicked in the extra few thousand to get the 6-cyl. over the buzzy little turbo 4 cyl. It was well worth it, as the six gives you an extra 55 naturally-aspirated HP, which is noticeable on hilly roads as well as in passing situations. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship! Hard starting Since September of \\'06, this car has been returned to the dealer for a total of approximately 6 weeks to try to fix a serious mechanical problem - namely, extremely hard starting in cold weather.  Based on Audi\\'s suggestions, a number of the car\\'s components, including the coils and exhaust valves, have been replaced, but the problem has been neither identified or fixed.  (The car has currently been at the dealer for almost 4 weeks with no progress.)  Surprisingly satisfied Audi Just got an A4 2.0T 6MT as my 2nd car due to its attractive lease deal. I wasn\\'t an Audi fan & never like quattro or FWD cars. My previous driving expriences on 1st Gen S4 was so-so only. I was always thought of getting a BMW 3 series as my daily. After I owned this A4 for a few weeks, I fell in love with the new 07 A4. Its suspension is so composed, even with the base 16\" wheel/tire setup, the suspension setting is firm yet comfortable. Handling is neutral to very minimal understeer. Overall experience is very good, on par with the last 3 series I drove. The 6MT shifts better than any BMW, period. Now, with $100 lower on monthly payment. I totally forget about the BMW and I\\'m loving it. 2007 Audi A4 - Impressive! This is my first Audi and so far I\\'m very pleased. The overall muscular look of the exterior and refined interior was what attracted me. The turbo engine has plenty of power especially in \"s\" mode. Interior controls are well laid out and the dual climate control works exceptionally well - very cold A/C. The ride is rather quiet and wind noise is relatively unnoticeable. Fuel economy is a bit less than advertised. I do mostly highway driving at 60-70 mph and I have been getting 30 mpg versus 32 mpg advertised. Overall, I\\'m very pleased with the value and quality of this car! Audi A4Q 2.0T My new 2007 A4 already been the shop 3 times.  Need a new engine @ 2200 miles.  Very unreliable machine.  Very unhappy customer.  Would not buy Audi again.  Idle rough at morning start.  Dealer said it is normal for all 2.0T.   Balanced Comfort This is my first Audi. I always had an impression of Audi being a \\x93softer\\x94 BMW, and all in all I think I was correct. After having owned many performance cars I was looking for something more comfortable for my long drives so I decided to check out Audi. This is definitely a comfortable car. You get a fair amount of luxury, good performance, great gas mileage, and a beautiful car inside and out for the money; all without the unwanted \\x93image\\x94 the BMW provides, which frankly I got tired of. If you want a more performance oriented car the 3-series is cream of the crop; however, if you want a more compliant German made car the A4 is a great car for less money.  I like it! This is my first sedan. I never thought I\\'d get one, but I truly like my Audi.  Going from a V6 engine has been my only real adjustment.  The lag still bothers me a bit, but once you pick up speed, wow!  The car really moves. I had considered a BMW, but Audi had a better deal, and I am very pleased with my car. It\\'s a classy car. Tempest In A Tea Cup Being a previous owner of a Passat, I was not particularly excited about taking delivery of this car.  I was a BMW zealot (and still have a late model bimmer parked next to the Audi) but got excited, very excited about driving this car! The Quattro is a godsend - much better than X-drive.  The fit and finish is superb.  The creature comforts well matched.  This car is a winner.  Its dichotomous nature is aptly suited to both the executive who thinks he could drive in a rally and to the retiree who likes a sport tuned suspension with the confidence of knowing they have all-wheel ability.  One will not be disappointed with this car. Enjoy and cheers. Audi A4 2T sedan  I haven\\'t owned this vehicle long enough (purchased 1/2007) to give a complete review. I was pleasantly surprised at the power and response from such a small engine. I find myself wondering why everyone else is driving so slow on the highway. At slower speeds and around corners, the handling is very quick with very little lean.The manual shifting with the 2T package takes some getting used to and, frankly, some practice. The suspension is somewhat stiff but I think you\\'d have to agree that it is race oriented. The interior is comfortable and \"no nonsense\". Everything is there and nicely organized around the driver. I personally liked the gauge positioning and control positioning.  A Balanced Machine What other vehicle in this class offers luxury, performance, safety, cachet, fuel economy, and quality at the price of an A4? BMW arguably makes a superior car, but the value is not there (and how will you know which one is yours in the parking lot?). M-B lacks quality. The Japanese makes don\\'t offer the driving experience of the Germans, and the Americans are sans cachet.  To me, the A4 fills a neat niche left by the others with an incredible drivetrain, legendary ergonomics, earth- and wallet-saving fuel economy, IIHS safety cred, and lease deals galore, it\\'s a no-brainer.  Drive everything else first. Hella-cool Second A4 I\\'ve owned and it keeps getting better and better. Love the design, the engine, the interior. Still notice the turbo lag but not as pronounced as my 05 A4 1.8L. The car will get up and move when asked and is very responsive, and I love to hear the growl of the engine. Until audi does something really bad to these cars I\\'ll always buy another audi. Will always recommend audi before other luxury cars also. I wouldn\\'t buy it again When I bought my 1.8T AWD, dealer insisted it would last over 100k with no problem. As soon as mine went off the warranty it several major failures: headlight switch (common in all Audis), tensioner gasket (huge oil leak demanding entire engine disassembly), instrument panel (dead horizontal lines), and 2 secondary air pump failures. Not to mention the quarterly visits to the dealer while the car was still before 30k to fix check engine light (leaking hoses). This is my last German car. Driving it was lots of fun but I can\\'t deal with thousands of dollars in repairs and repeat visits to the $120-an-hour labor dealer. Buy at your own risk - and read the forums before you do! Great car and right price I have had my A4 for a month and it handles any curve in any condition. The all-wheel drive is great. I upgraded to the sport suspension and it really makes the ride more firm so make sure that you really want that as the regular suspension is already pretty good and sometimes I think I would not mind a little softer ride although it does allow you to take a corner at 75 and makes it feel like 25. The inside is way better then the BMW or Acura. Great car overall with a great style all its own. If you go to the snow this car is great, I have already taken it to tahoe and while others were putting on chains I just kept on driving.   Amazing car I have now owned my 6th Audi (4th A4) and I will say for sure, Audi has come back to be the overall segment leader in the compact luxury car segment for the total package.  I have already put over 5K miles on the car without a hitch, just got the first scheduled service for free. Even being front drive this car handles extremely well and the performance is much greater than expected for a 4 cylinder, thanks to direct injection. The \"base\" stereo system rocks as well as the Bose stereo from previous A4s. Heated seats aren\\'t really necessary in Arizona but have come in handy on a few cool nights. Overall fit and finish is unmatched by any other cars in class Best car for the money! I bought this car for my daughter, who previously had a Volvo S40 and a Volvo S60. Both are very good, safe cars but lack any sense of excitement.  I drive a Porsche and when it was in for service I was given an A4 as a loaner and loved it.  Tight as a drum, well-balanced, great handling, outstanding gas mileage and really fun to drive (I grab it whenever I can!).  Excellent build quality, great exterior design and an interior way beyond anything in its price class.  Buy it!   New Audi Owner After a bad experience with my 2006 BMW and the run flat tires (my third BMW), I researched many cars to see what would be the BMW\\'s replacement.  When I drove the Audi A4 3.2 quattro, I knew I would never go back to BMW.  The car handles better, better ride, quiet, large trunk, great storage and many useful features. It\\'s an all around awesome car and I\\'m looking forward to many years of driving enjoyment.  This car is outstanding I love driving this car.  It has a great feel and handles very well on back country roads. Great Buy I found my stylish, sporty and comfortable A4 is a lot of car for the money. Audi girl The performance is awesome Clutch went at 17.5k The clutch started slipping at 17.5k miles. I\\'m in my 70\\'s, and don\\'t abuse the car. The dealers said it is \"normal wear and tear\" and don\\'t want to warranty it. The dealer gave me an estimate of $4900 plus tax to replace. I sold my last two cars with 105k and 95k miles respectively both with the original clutches still working fine. Guess I should have stayed with Honda products. Audi support was of little help. Good car, unreliable acceleration The car drives very nicely, and the ride is good. The acceleration from a stop or slow speed when needed is totaly unreliable. One time it is great, another it is dangerous.  You can\\'t rely on this car to accelerate. We will return to Mercedes for the next car. Certified Pre Owned program 2016 Audi A4 quattro The 2016 dealer demonstrator  with low mileage, was a great find.   The A4 Premium Plus quattro sedan had only low mileage with an in-service date of September 2016 showed no wear anywhere in the engine compartment, under carriage, interior or exterior.  It performs like a sports car, but has the enough room and luggage space for 4 people to take on a day trip.   (Two people would be very comfortable on a long distance trip with luggage. ) The included options over above the Premium Plus model level was the convenience package, S - Line package, and technology package.  I found little incentive to pay an extra $10,000 more to purchase a 2017 with the same equipment.   With an Audi Certified Pre-Owed auto you get the remaining warranty from the original in-servce date plus an additional 100,000 warranty after the multi-point inspection of at least 100 different checked & approved parts of the car.   After 7 months I could not be happier! Audi A4 great car!! Very comfortable car with great mileage.  Super reliability and have had 0 problems.  Just a little on high side for maintenance.  Back seats are need more room. Overall quality is great.  Would recommend you buy a certified one from Audi and save tons of money and excellent warranty. Great Audi I rented an Audi A4 wagon in Europe for a week and drove around 1000 miles in it. Overall it is a great vehicle, comfortable, engine response is prompt, transmission is flawless, ride is quiet, steering is sharp. For negatives I would note the complexity and lack of intuitiveness of the infotainment system, using their GPS was taking too long to set on a destination and I kept using my TomTom. I guess it takes time to learn how to use it, same with toggling with the map display in the central area between the speed and tachometer. Also at low speeds the brake looses linearity and suddenly locks the wheels if you press a little harder. Also getting in and out of the car is a bit uncomfortable. But the overall impression is great, you don\\'t even know when you get to pass everyone, the car is still quiet and seems so effortless. Ding Dong the Witch is DEAD! I just had the misfortune of renting this car for a week.  Wow, what a joke.I had the base model with the S-Line package and a few extras like navigation.The car was wholly unpleasant to drive.  The CVT an obvious annoyance, the interior, instrumentation and controls utterly mediocre and old fashioned.  It wasn\\'t antiquated like a Subaru, but it seemed like a step down from even a VW, which is inexcusable for the cost.Everything about the driving experience made me completely puzzled as to why anyone would cross shop with this a similarly priced BMW 3 Series and pick this Audi.I\\'m not a BMW fanboy or anything, but the two vehicles are incompatible in driving experience, and yet they are about the same price.  Audi is supposed to be the premium arm of VW, and yet frankly this car is so easily bested in this segment by so many alternatives.Thank goodness that the 2017 model is a complete redesign. Great shopping experience aided by the Edmunds End Up leasing the car, but your info helped to make decision. Thanks! Not worth the money My car is an A4 Quattro premium S-Line. It stickered just shy of the $50k mark. If I wasn\\'t able to get a smoking deal on it I would have never bought it. Sure, it\\'s pretty. Sure, people go \"ooohhh, you have an Audi\" but honestly, this car is nowhere near worth the price of entry. For $15k less you can get a fully loaded Passat with the 1.8t which is all anyone really needs. You will wind up with a much bigger, more comfortable car. With darn near the same build quality, and it will have everything a modern car should have. For example...Bluetooth streaming audio. The Audi doesn\\'t have it until you pony up for the premium plus package. Which pushes you over that 50k mark. Another place the A4 falls woefully short is the back seat. If you have kids in booster seats, get ready to wrestle with seatbelts because the seat area is so narrow your booster WILL block the buckle. And we have the Diono Cambria which is a fairly narrow booster. Still blocks the buckle. Also, if anyone riding up front is over 6\\' tall, you will render that back seat virtually useless. My 4 year old complains about being squished behind me, I\\'m 6\\'3\". We don\\'t have the problem in our far less expensive, much more equipped Passat. Basically, if you are of average or lower stature, the A4 might be ok for you, as long as you\\'re ok with paying a boatload of money for a car that has some seriously glaring omissions in the options department. If you want a well built German car that has everything in it and won\\'t break the bank, go to VW and save some money. Why, Audi, Why? After 11 years, my beloved A4 passed on to another plane of existence. I had always planned to buy another Audi when the time came. I didn\\'t buy this car because for some reason, this Audi can\\'t do what my much less expensive VW can do. I want to connect my phone to my car via Bluetooth and not only get phone calls but also my music, Waze, Spotify etc., to play through the speakers. I can\\'t do this in the Audi unless I purchase the much more expensive package or plug my phone in.. to a cord... in the glove box. No. Just no. Also, CVT transmissions are crap and forced me into a more expensive Quattro to avoid them. Who doesn\\'t want to feel the car shifting? Who likes CVT transmissions?! Also, the back seats don\\'t fold down, there\\'s not even a ski sack like my 2005 had. So, there\\'s no option for a bit more room.  I did not buy the Audi. I wanted so badly to buy the Audi but I just couldn\\'t do it. I bought a Mercedes-Benz instead. I\\'m hoping Audi gets it right in the next several years. Accessibility isn\\'t easy Not one of the easiest cars to get in and out from both sides of the car. Consistently hit my head or the door post. Once in the car it was great. I\\'m average height. Someone taller or bigger would struggle> It\\'s the main reason I did not get this car The Wanderer Very disappointed with steering.  On straight roads and at speeds over 60mph the car is ALL over the road.  You will need to work hard on a long trip to keep it on track.  I had the car brought in right away to Princeton Audi.  The result,  they said that the steering is within correct limits.  My conclusion is this is either a very poor design by Audi or Princeton Audi Service is incapable of correcting the problem.  My advice, make sure to test drive at speed over 60mph before purchasing. Great vehicle for the year. Make sure you check everything , water leaks from convertible roof, oil leaks from engine to rear axle and have dealer fix any problems before paying for it. Love hate relationship I love the thought of this car, it gets good gas mileage, it\\'s comfortable and looks nice with the top down and it\\'s great at high speeds. What I don\\'t like... The  maintenance! It\\'s very expensive, in just two months I had an oil leak, coolent leak, transmission speed sensor failure, a whole new ac, the gear shifter peace spilt apart, the car starts funny, etc. This car also isn\\'t fast enough for me. I should have got the V6 Quattro but that\\'s probably just me. I want to keep the car but on the other hand I could lease a brand new one for the same price as the  maintenance on this one. A disappointment The good points: The ride and handling are great, the convertible top design is a delight.The bad: Everything is going to cost you (more). Within 50 miles of driving I had a check engine light. The interior ergonomics are, in my opinion, dreadful, with the single cheap plastic cupholder as a start, the plastic click click switches, and more plastic parts that break (sun visor clip, center armrest for me).The extremely annoying warnings. There\\'s the two hour \\'stop driving and take a break\\' warning. the tone when you open the drivers door with the turn signal on. It treats the driver like a moron. Never again! THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING! Bought the A4 convertible new. I only used it as a second car and have driven 32,000 miles now. When it still was under warranty a warning light come on and I was told it is nothing serious and AUDI service made it go away. The light came on and off several times in the last year. Recently the car was hesitating when accelerating. AUDI now quoted $2,200 for repair of the transmission control box. When it was in repair they told me they have found problems with the transmission and the repair would be $7,000!! Can anyone imagine that on a car for $50,000 with only 32,000 miles.  Audi -Never again Bought an A4 2004 with extended warranty. Made a maintanence checkup with Keys Audi in Los Angeles. Told me i had to wait 2 weeks. i origanlly had a bad vibration problem to seek the appt anyway. 2 weeks latwer at 103,000 mile son car they would not honor the 100,00 warranty. AND would not honor the extended warranty. I called Audi America and bitc$$! Made them honor the extended warranty. Only got an oil change and tire rotation( SCREWED) OK THEN i asked them what was the vibration,THEY TOLD ME...Motor Mounts. Wanted 2k from the dealer to fix. I went to local mech for $800. Replaced them vibration was still there. 3 days later ENGINE BLEW! Due to timing chain fail.Called them,did nothing Audi A4 1.8t 2004 Nice reliable car until the CVT transmission went out at only 71,000 miles.  $6,000 repair from the dealer.  $5,000 to rebuild it.   Great mileage.  Good ride and handles well.  Looks sharp.  Should have bought extended warranty.   Won\\'t be buying another Audi.   Unreliable luxury CVT transmission had to be replaced at 50k miles, but had the symptoms at an earlier 30k miles (there\\'s an existing TSB for this issue).  Working with Audi of America to see what our options are.  Always had the vehicle serviced at an Audi dealer at the prescribed maintenance intervals.  Day after the trans install, the check engine light was on, which was found to be a defect part on the \\'new\\' transmission.  Love the car, but can\\'t afford the maintenance.  I thought German cars were built to last.  A lot of other little things are broken, not working, or just acting up in the car.  I think it\\'s time to see what BMW has to offer... CVT- Rare Code 3rd week of ownership transmission shot. CVT with Rare Code GZE looked all over country finally found used. New $6000 Used $2500. Not how I wanted to start with Audi. Will sell once fixed. Dealer not helpful at all. Left me to find trans. so they wouldn\\'t have to stand behind it. THANKS. Won\\'t by Audi again. Keeping my A4 Cab! I\\'ve now had Audis (3 of them) for 14 years.  Historically problems, but this gorgeous green A4 3.0L 2004 cab has been great!  Oh yeah, a minor electrical things telling me my satellite radio isn\\'t working (although it does just fine!), but that\\'s nothing.  The car is so great to drive.  Lacking a little on comfort for long trips, but that\\'s no surprise.  I have only 67K miles (about 5 years) and have no thoughts of looking for anything else.  Can\\'t come up with anything I\\'d enjoy driving more than this.  And the wind screen is great, allowing me to put top down (windows and heater up) when sunny and 45 when dressed appropriately.  I love this car!!! After all these years... still fun OK. Had this car 5 years now and wanted to add some perspective to all these reviews. First, car is great and works very well. No major issues while under warranty. A few little things here and there -- warm up when cold is rough and car rattles a bit, cup holder finally bit the dust in dash and will never come out again. (Partly its own fault and partly my anger out of its complete uselessness). Low water light for window washer comes on for no reason. Out of warranty had to have some vacuum hose work done for $700. Overall the car is still great but with all the little nits and nags you would expect with any car after 5 years and 70k miles. Roof great and no leaks! A blast to drive but VERY pricey to fix! This is an amazing car to drive. It handles like a dream  on both dry roads and ice packed roads. The interior is beautiful and very functional. You will definitely get some head turns with this car. I would, however, anyone who is considering buying this car to reconsider. The car is extremely expensive to fix and seems to have more problems than the average car. I have taken amazing car of the car but unfortunately it has not returned the favor. In the past 6 months I have put approximately $4500 into the car. I don\\'t know how much longer I can keep it up. I would highly recommend looking at a Toyota convertible. So So Audi I have had my A4  for 2.5 yrs. I had 34000 miles on the car when I bought and now have 82000. In the last year I have had to replace the ignition coil, fuel pump, and I\\'m getting ready to take it in for a trans module that costs $2000. And I just found out my top leaks and will need to be replaced at $2500. This is a car you need to get rid of at 40 or 50k miles. Audi I hope you see this review. It\\'s time to trade for a Toyota or Honda. Good/Fun Car! I have owned Audi for just about a year now!  I am the type of person to get over my cars within a year.  So far, I am still loving it! It handles great! I love to drive it long distances, due to how comfortable it is. It was between the BMW 325 CI or this and I am so glad I choose this car!   1.8t I love my car, great price, great look. The only bad thing that have is the front bumper is too patch to the floor and in the street of Puerto Rico is a problem. But this car is great. The best car I ever have. Best than a Volvo C70, BMW 335, Mercedez CLK, Saab or Volkswagon. Buying 2 more I cannot tell you how much I love this car. Coming from a previous Chevy Tahoe, this car is ridiculously built better and the mpg I get is 30 in town and around 35 on hwy. I love the top, mine\\'s white body with blue top. I was warned about the maintenance and labor cost for German cars, they\\'re not any higher than a  Tahoe to maintain and you save on gas too. I have 64k on mine and it\\'s never given me one complaint, just oil changes and regular service. My husband\\'s also getting one to get rid on the truck 15mpg.  Got a lemon Since I purchased my convertible in a matter of the first year within 7 months I had the transmission replaced 3 times. Recently the oil pump malfuctioned and the engine blew. 2 days later the radiator hose went. 3 weeks later the engine lost power. This car has been in the shop at least 25-30 times in the past 3 years for various things. I finally hired and attorney and used the lemon law which was successful monetarialy but had to keep the car the rest of the lease which is up in 2 months!!! Thank god!!  I love the looks of the car but mine was NOT worth the trouble. I have a convertible and cannot use it most of the time as it is always in the shop. Good LK Would do it again..despite roof problems I wanted a fast fun car for a reasonable price and got it. Had serious issues with the convertible top not working and it took SIX WEEKS during the Indian Summer for the dealer to fix it (more of an issue of the dealer\\'s inability to fix a problem properly). Other than that issue, everything else has been great with the car. I have the sports package which I\\'d forget if I did it all over again (too many potholes and bumpy roads in the metropolitan area). At the end of the day, I do have to say that I still love this car.  Love my 3.0 cab Living in the northeast, I was hesitant to spend this much $ on a convertible, but have to say I love it.  The performance, handling and comfort of the car is amazing.  Can\\'t imagine giving up any of the features.  The 3.0 is a little sluggish off the line, but makes up for it quickly with a lot of power.  It\\'s so much fun to drive, looks great and is really comfortable. Great Car This is the first car I have really enjoyed driving. It is responsive, amazing when the turbo kicks in, and I get positive comments from people on the street all the time which has never happened to me before.  However, I have had to have the transmission replaced at 12000 miles, it just didn\\'t go into gear one day and had to be towed.  The dealer was great about replacing it but it did take 4 weeks until I got the car back. Always something wrong with it I bought my A4 in May 03. It was one problem after another.  The trunk compartment for holding the top broke and needed to be replaced.  The final straw was when the transmission needed to be replaced with only 9k on the car!  It had been making some strange creaking noises but the dealer kept insisting it was just loose bolts they needed to tighten.  After several visits to the shop, they finally determined that the transmission was defective.  In 9 months of owning the car, it was probably in the shop for a total of 8 weeks.  I would never buy another Audi.  Very poor quality. Convertible Top Troubles This past December while lowering my soft top, I heard a rip. After raising the top, a small tear was noted. With Audi\\'s inclusive warranty, I called Crown Eurocar (my dealer) and was given an appointment for 2 weeks.  When the car went in to Crown the service department rep said, \"yea it is ripped and would need to be replaced (first day lost;they had refused to just look at it without appt.).  Returned 2 weeks later for repair.Loaner given and told it should take a day to repair. Next day the only tech who could repair it was out.  Finally it was determined that a defect was responsible, the car had slipped quality control and the entire top had to be replaced (after ok from Audi) Excellent Vehicle I have owned this vehicle for a year \\rnow. It performs beautifully, and gets \\rgreat mileage. Fun to drive around \\rtown, performs great on the highway, \\rand is extremely quick for a 4 cyl \\rwith the tip-tronic transmission. If \\ryou can push a button, then you know \\rhow to use the top. Comes standard \\rwith numerous comfort options. If you \\rare interested in a convertable in \\rthis category then I highly recommend \\rlooking at this vehicle. You wont be \\rdisappointed. Great Car  Very smooth ride, quiet, fast.  The car \\rgets so much attention. Best car Ive \\rever owned.  Perfection Just perfect !!!!!! great look, \\rincredible performance,low gas \\rconsumtion... it is a continuous \\rpleasure to drive it.  I LOVE MY CAR! when the top is up you have blind spots \\rbacking up.  really should have auto \\rhead lamps,for the price.  the car mats \\rare really cheap for the price of the \\rcar.   Good God I love this car! This car\\'s \"Wow\" factor is off the \\rchart.  Heads turn wherever I go.  \\rPeople pull up next to me a red lights \\rto tell me how much they like it.\\rThe ride is so firm and solid it feels \\rlike the car was carved out of a solid \\rpiece of metal.  With the top down \\rthere\\'s only a little more wind than if \\ryou had the windows down in a sedan. Excellent Car!!!!! After 4 MBZ SLK\\'s my Audi is a much\\rneeded change.  I almost forgot what a\\rcar in this class was suppose to be!  \\rExcellent ride, handling and fit! It is\\reasy to see the outstanding attention to\\rdetail Audi has by the interior.  Only\\rone  less than perfect comment - the\\rcupholders.  The in-dash holder does not\\rhold cups correctly and falls out.  The\\rarm rest holders are, well, in the arm\\rrest!  Not very useable!  However since\\rthis is my only less than perfect\\rcomment..I think I can live with it!  Errands are fun! Previous owner of 3 SUV\\'s, my kids \\rbegged me to get a cool car.  This car \\rmakes running around really fun. I am \\rthrilled with the handling and gas \\rmileage. I have the top down almost \\revery day. Great vehicle. Fun & classy...I love it! Best convertible ever! Even strangers  AUDI Clearly outstanding!  I evaluated \\ragainst BMW 330i and found the BMW to \\rbe nicely built but with older styling, \\ra cheaper interior and for $5k more!  \\rThe choice was easy.  This car is a \\rheadturner! why great car have no ideas on how to  Impressive This is a great car, well made, \\rfantastic finish. Definitely fun to \\rdrive. For drivers in the North East, \\rthe combination of the AWD system and \\rthe convertible are a great match. I \\rhave owned a 98 528 and a 2001 E320, \\rand this car is on par with the fit and \\rfinsih of the BMW and light years ahead \\rof the Mercedes. The only knock I have \\ris it is a little slow off the line but \\ronce you are at 20 mph you are fine. \\rGas mileage in general is fair but when \\ryou are in the sports transmission mode \\ror drive it hard it poor, but I am sure \\rmost people are not buying this for the \\rgas mileage.... Substance and Style I was skeptical that spending more \\rmoney provided you more substance.  \\rThe new A4 Cab. I purchased has \\rchanged my mind.  I purchased the car \\rwith the 3L-AWD.  The ride and \\rhandling are exceptional.  The car is \\rquiet and comfortable.  I previously \\rowned Subaru Legacy with AWD and an \\rAlfa Romeo convertible.  This car \\rblends the best of both these autos.  \\rIt has the precision, comfort, and \\rstyle of the Alfa with the common \\rsense of the Subaru AWD.   Audi Convertible Great ride, however I am having an \\rongoing problem with the Turbo Intake \\rHose, I have been back to the dealer 4 \\rtimes in 4 months! Get used to it, and love it.

It has a  Best Audi Yet This is my 4th Audi, and they keep \\rgetting better!  Unlike most \\rconvertibles this car rides smooth and \\rquiet; no shakes or rattles, even on \\rHouston\\'s rough roads.  The 3.0 V6 has \\rmore than enough power for city \\rdriving.

Their cars continue to \\roffer an unbeatable combinatgion of \\rsome of the highest build quality, \\rdesign, materials and performance at a \\rvery competitive price.  My new A4 \\rCabriolet is (so far) the best of my \\rAudis.   Great! Wow!  This car is great!  Great \\rperfomance, great handling. Everything I Hoped For I did alot of research and wanted a \\rconvertible with front wheel drive for \\rwinter, a back seat for two, and looks \\rthat could turn heads. This car fills \\rthe bill and more. The top goes down \\rfast, the car handles beautifully, and \\rthe controls especially on the wheel \\rare great.I would recommend getting \\rthe wind screen for highway driving. \\rIt really makes a difference with your \\rsignificant female other.The \\rtransmission is silky smooth and this \\rcar can pass anything on the road \\rwithout a problem.In summary, it is a \\rcar that is fun to drive and great to \\rlook at A4 Conv  when i was looking at conv to buy i \\rlooked at all choices and i so wanted \\rthe Bmw but after i drove the Audi all \\rthat changed. Audi gives u a 4 yr \\r50,000 mile warranty which covers \\reverything except tires. that alone is \\ra great thng to have. I also own a Bmw \\rat the moment and would def like to \\rtrade it in the near future. the \\roverall service from Audi Customer \\rRelations and The purchasing dealer \\rhave been great. Its great to get into \\ra Audi loaner as well when u come for \\rService not a Enterprise Escort when u \\rhave Bmw And Benz.  The A4 convertible The wide threshold results in \\rdifficulty getting out of the car.  \\rCoupled with wide doors that don\\'t open \\renough when in a parking space, the car \\ris just not comfortable unless you\\'re \\rover 6 feet, or want to push the seat \\rall the way back to get out.  Also, \\rwhen the top is up, the visibility is \\rvery poor when backing out of a parking \\rspace. overall good deal The Audi A4 convertible is a great car \\rand fun to drive. I have had issues \\rwith the top not operating properly and \\rthe middle brake light cycling on and \\roff, but overall a great little car. quality THE CAR IS EXTREMELY WELL DONE.  The \\rexperience i have had thus far is just \\rthe incredible handling and extremely \\rsophisticated convertible top, which \\rgives me a sedan like db on the \\rinterior.  Audi even placed carpet \\runder the wheel well. Nice Car Great looking. Fun to drive. Has more  Love and hate, go hand in hand for this car. You really have to be passionate about owning this car. Like, to a point where fixing it as almost your priority. There is something constantly wrong with this car. Sunroof leak... ruins the headliner... also to a point where water will ruin the amp.... suspension issues with the control arm bushings not lasting, J-plug cracking and leaking coolant... and putting plastic just where it doesn\\'t belong, window electronics crap out too. It\\'s almost not worth the premium price brand new if you think about it. There is always something wrong with this car.  It was probably best to lease this car when it was brand new... don\\'t get this car used... there is a reason why you don\\'t see so many of these cars on the road. And as far and repairing this car... parts are expensive and what crawl space do you have to work with. You have to remove so many excess things just to get to what you need. I loved this car, but it was such a hassle. Fun to drive at a price I have now owned my 2004 audi a4 3.0L with ultrasport package for a bit over 4 years.This car is a blast to drive, and living in Minnesota, it is the best vehicle I have ever driven in the snow.Having said that I have been most definitely disappointed with the reliability.It seems every 4-6 months I have a major repair, not including the little things that I take care of myself.New tires every 1-2 years (15,000 miles/yr)Timing belt at 75,000, new radiator fan, new clutch and flywheel.I have spent $4000 in repairs on it this year alone.So beware and know that it may be cheaper than some, has great style, and is a lot of fun, but you may be betteroff with something more durable. Great AWD Wagon Older couples\\' car with all documentation. Rides, looks and feels excellent. Great Bose stereo. Ultra sport package is awesome! Easy to forget this is a wagon. I traded in a 2008 Suzuki SX4 4 cyl AWD hatchback for this car. I wanted more power and luxury. Did some research and, an Avant 3.0 was the best bet. I really like the B6 (2002-05) generation of this car, Audi styling at its\\' epitome. Current generations (B7 & B8 late 2005-08, 2009-) A4s\\' styling is way out there, not my taste at all. Very happy after ten months I had the benefit of reading a bunch of reviews before buying my 2004 Audi A4 Avant, so I figured that I\\'d add my two cents to the mix.  The Audi wasn\\'t initially on my radar screen.  I was looking to spend $20,000 on a used wagon that could handle snow (which my BMW 528E could not).  I was taken by the Passat Wagon, drove it, then almost sprung for a new one, but I got spooked by the aggressive discounting by local dealers, which usually means bad resale value in a few years.  Then I looked closely at the Saab 9-5, BMW 3-Series, and Audi A4 wagons.  Considering handling, comfort, volume, price, re-sale, the Audi blew me away.  Now ten months later, I can further confirm that this is a great car. Ultra-Sport Avant Ultra-Fun! Just looking at the car makes me grin ear to ear. Great lines and inside it just continues, leather, feel-good dash, excellent sound system. Fast enough and brakes that actually do there job. Drove from Chicago to New Jersey with the wife and our two dogs. Fold-down rear seats with built-in dog screen, the tops! I have become an Audi enthusiast! The dealership was top notch along with the salesman. The service incredible. fun, fun, fun... My Avant is the most fun, best handling \\rcar I\\'ve ever had and that includes \\ra \\'78 911SC!

A4 Avant For the money, hands down this is the \\rbest car in its class.  No other car \\rdrives like the quattro all wheel.  You \\rfeel very much in control in all \\rweather conditions.  I made a very good \\rbuying decision!  :-) 2004 Audi Made sure that the drivers wheel has everthing on it. Also that it has  navigation, bluetooth and the ability to control everything in vehicle on steering wheel. Its not all that bad I have owned 3 A4 1.8t quattros (1997) was my first car. I have honestly never had a MAJOR issue with either of my 3 cars, worst thing i had happen was my suspension spring broke while i was driving (in the 1997). I donno maybe i got lucky and everyone got stuck with the bad batch hahaha but any way. Car honestly looks nice from outside and in, drives and handles like a champ, not as fast but if u want a fast car get ones wit bigger engines. there are tho some down falls to em such as the [non-permissible content removed] plastic everyone keeps bringing up, window regulators going out. fortunately i know how to work on em so i never take em to service them. but for those of you who are getting them used and are not prepared to service them on time...dont get it ull just waste your money. if you are and plan to maintain them and not drive like a nascar driver, they will last an would be worth it. by far best car i ever drove AUDI has not yet learned to build reliable cars ! Plastic parts used throughout the engine compartment get old, brittle, fall apart under normal engine heat.  Need to take many things apart under the engine compartment to service.  Plastic fuel lines kink easily and cause fuel pump failure.  Exhaust system falls apart after 6 years.  Glove compartment easily breaks off.  New parts cost more than the car itself.  Audi Stealership (TOWNE AUDI of Englewood NJ) out to rape people overcharging $140/hr. like it was a new car.  Stay away from used AUDI\\'s and buy a used Lexus, Infinity or Accura if you want a reliable used car.  Sold the car as of March 2016 and bought a wonderful SUBARU FORESTER. STICKY LITTLE 6 speed  My dream(affordable) car I\\'ve owned this car for about 3 years and have driven it personally for about a year so far(my mother was driving it before me) the interior is great looking but the material that covers the buttons is crap and supper cheap. The car handles very nicely and sounds great for a bone stock car. In terms of reliability, ive had only little things break like the glove box hinges and window regulator but WOW was it expensive-400$ for a window regulator. that includes the labor aswell. The sound system is great 10 spkrs all around and it comes with a sub built in if you get it with Bose. I\\'ve added 19in rs4 rims and man o man does it look nice. performance wise is a great cruiser but not that fast, like 0-60 7-8 ish seconds. a full tank costs about 60 and you\\'ll be looking at 250-320 miles range. The only thing I hate about this car is the steering wheel, I cant really find a comfortable way of holding it since the stereo controls or in the sides but other than that great and car and I would consider buying another one. newer model of course. I love it, but I hate it too. This car is fantastic... When it works.  For all the two years I\\'ve had it, I don\\'t think it has worked properly for more than two months of that time.  There\\'s always some problem which is hard to diagnose, the problem which then ends up being expensive.  This is not to say that it isn\\'t a great car, it certainly is.  The Quattro AWD is spectacular in the snow and sticks to the road in summer as well.  Performance needs improvement though --- There\\'s very little low-end torque, and there just needs to be more horsepower to propel this 3,500 pound car.\\rOverall I\\'d say don\\'t get this car over 100,000 miles, it\\'ll just frustrate  Love it! Owned my A4 1.8T for a year now, bought it used. I love it, the cost of service is a bit higher but the car seems to not need service as often, but time will tell. The interior is beautiful and comfy, but there is a serious lack of cup holders...Performance is amazing, for a 4 cylinder car it has some serious power with the turbo, and the car corners like a dream. Handles very good in winter conditions with the Quattro 2004 Audi A4 1.8T FWD I bought my \\'04 A4 1.8T FWD a little under a year ago with 87,xxx miles on it, haven\\'t had a single problem with it beyond regular maintenance. Keeping up on regular maintenance is important to preserve the life of the car (more so than for non-European cars). Fortunately, any known problems (like the timing belt) had been worked out by the previous owner. Very good value, rock solid reliability, comfortable and very fun to drive. If you want speed, get the 3.0 V6 or the S4. As it is though, the 1.8T CVT goes from 0-60 in 7.8 seconds in Sport, or 8.5 seconds in Drive. Not to bad for a small engine, getting 33 mpg on the highway. Handles like a dream. Very nice interior. Audio system rocks. 2004 audi a4 Love this car very nice easy to take care off have over 200k on it only maintence is oil changes evey 4 months and timeing belt water pump every 65k other thin that nothing  Beautiful Disaster I have a previously owned a4, with the ultra sport package. This car has every possible added feature. When my car was working, it was a pleasure to drive. The performance alone, is outstanding. You could drive at 100mph and it felt like you were going 50mph. The AWD was fantastic for snow and rain, I had no problems with traction. I do know that they are EXTREMELY expensive to maintain and own. Any time my check engine light would come on, which was every month, it would cost no less than 1000$ to have it turned off. One problem ALWAYS led to another and it was so frustrating and discouraging when my car had to be brought in for repairs. Overall, I am saddened to retire this car bc of costs Fun to drive, but a steep investment in repairs. I\\'ve had an opportunity to drive all kinds of cars, from BMWs to Volvos, to high end japanese vehicles and NOTHING has handled and performed like my Audi. This car feels like you are going 60 miles an hour at 100. You can barely feel the body roll as you effortlessly carve through corners at high speeds, and no automaker has a better interior. On the downside, prepare to set aside about 3000$ a year for repair and maintenance! Even oil changes will run you 100$, and when your fuel pump dies (and it probably will!) You can expect to spend 1000$ at the dealer if it\\'s out of warranty. This is a driving enthusiasts car that\\'s also a comfortable commuter. I love my Audi, expensive or not! Good Go Kart.... Love the layout and the raw power of the Quat!!! Very fun to drive and take for the long hauls...so comfy... Loved it but it had to go This was by far my favorite Audi.An 04 Ultrasport.Fantastic handling.Good thing I had an extended warranty - the car broke a lot - always something - the only way I would consider driving another Audi product at this time would be if I could have this car back - after repairing it month after month I sold it to buy a new Audi.I traded that within a month of buying it.

REALLY Ok so i feel like the only people that write reviews are the people that have problems...... Really you are switching from a Nice loaded sports car to a cheapo Economy car with cloths seats?????? I myself have never had any problems and several of my buddies have never had any problems only on EDMUNDS do people have problems..... Best Car ever Owned Original owner of this 3.0 A4 since new. Right off the lot, negotiated 5% down. Now 7 yrs experience with it with 81K kms traveled. Quality, stability, stance, control, performance are all above great with decent gas mileage of 7.9l/100km highway 9-10l/100km city with quattro using synthetic. Audi maintenance covers everything during 3 yr warr and dealer\\'s have provided exceptional service. They replaced all my brake disc\\'s, pads and spark plugs all under warranty. Burnt bulbs, lighter socket, wiper lever seized from salt also replaced /w warr.Coils replaced under recall, but never problems just glithces with electronic in window controls, sunroof, and resets of A/C. 2004 Audi A4 3.0 Pros:When running properly, the performance of this car is impressive.It was built for the Autobahn and is fun to drive fast, but we\\'re not in Germany. Cons: I\\'ve had many mechanical and computer issues.Driver side electric window mechanism replaced, catalytic converter replaced, speakers go in and out on the front driver side, ignition coils replaced, uses a lot of oil, check engine light on more often than not.At <b>least<b/> a $1000 everytime I have to take it to the shop.The interior design isn\\'t practical.The second cup holder is in the middle console but it\\'s very cumbersome to access.I\\'m shopping for a new car and it won\\'t be an Audi. Be prepared to spend $$$ on maintenance It\\'s great when it everything is in running order.I bought the car new and have since run it to 188k miles.At 115k, the engine died on me.Something came loose that ruined one of the cylinders. Fortunately, I have a friend who\\'s a mechanic that was able to procure me a used engine with 60k on it. After that, the bushings had to be replaced and then the fuel pump.I love my car and still have it, but I don\\'t think I\\'ll buy Audi again. Too much money for maintenance and gas. Worst car ever A week after I bought the car the fuel pump went. Center arm rest broke and so did the glove box. Closed the door one day and the side air bags went off 6000 in repairs for the side airbags but was covered by Audi USA. Thermostat broke twice. The speakers cut in and out. Rear Windows won\\'t work and front ones work when they feel like it. Burns a quart of oil every 1000 miles Audi says this is normal. Had to replace the clutch. And transmission rebuild. Coils always fail leading to misfiring witch overheated my engine blowing the head gasket and cracking the head. There is lots more I\\'m forgetting I could have bought this car ten times over.  Never Buy Audi Worst Experience Ever! I had to take my car into the shop 5 times so far this year. First time I had to replace all ignition coils with recall (engine light flashing and car vibrating). 2nd time replaced coil pack for V6 engine light went on. 3rd time they checked engine and had the light off for 2 weeks. Light came on again said it was spark plugs. Didn\\'t replace spark plugs because they charge too much. 5th time came in and said i had to replace spark plugs and fuel injector. charged 195 dollars for labor. They rip people off. Replaced parts with labor was 370 dollars. My car\\'s check engine light is on again now. Least reliable vehicle ever. Audi A4 2004 V6 3.0 6M Ultra Sport I bought this car with approximately 40k miles on it after it had come off a lease. It\\'s fully loaded with every available feature for that model year and has a full leather interior. Black paint, black leather. It\\'s a sweet looking car and it drives really well. Overall I\\'m quite happy with the car and if I had to make the decision again I would buy the same car. I average about 28 MPG - mostly highway driving. The Ultra Sport package offers most of the S4 styling with much better fuel economy. Over the years, I\\'ve had the coil packs and the cat converters replaced under warranty, I\\'ve had to replace the win regulators on both front windows. I still love this car though. A4 1.8T with tip auto I bought this car used with 38k miles now it has 63k miles and the fuel pump along with airbag sensor and window motor all went bad. luckily i bought the extended warranty which covered all expenses with a minor 50 dollar deductible.  Very expensive car to keep up with i wouldn\\'t recommend it if you\\'re on a tight budget. One RSA good year tire $200 oil change $75. Car makes a grinding initially of every first start. The trans doesn\\'t feel very strong and i baby it so much i don\\'t even tip 2500 RPM. A light buld change is $100+ I\\'m going Toyota or Honda next. I can not believe Audi sells this VW at Audi price We purchased this 10 months ego and after 10 months of pain and problems it has stranded us 180 miles from home at 11pm.  We are replacing it with a Lexus RX300.  This has needed new catalytic converters, coils,O2 sensors, control arms, wiper mechanism, trunk actuator.  Sunroof is stuck, brake caliper is not working right and wears pads too fast on 1 side, tranny shifter gets stuck sometimes, 1 wheel is bent, power steering pump squeaks, and now the fuel pump gave up the ghost.  All between 75k and 98k.  First month we owned it, it spent 3 weeks in shops and 1 week on the road.  Most parts are VW.  I can not believe Audi sells this VW at Audi price.  Don\\'t be a fool and buy one. Beautifully refined car I have the 3.0 A4 with UltraSport package.  The rims and trim associated with this package turn this car into a head turner.  My previous vehicle was a 1991 MR2 Turbo.  Although it might be the slowest car in it\\'s class, I love it.  The biggest difference I experienced (compared to Japanese brands) is the attention to detail.  Things such as storage under the seating, lights under each door to illuminate where you are going to step, and a cool hidden trunk release, just to name a few.  It feels super solid on the road, especially in rain.  I chose the 3.0 over the 1.8T because I don\\'t want to deal with all the problems associated with high-mileage turbos.   I got lucky As the original owner, now with 75,000 miles, I have only a few minor complaints about this, my favorite car of all time.  Better handling, more comfortable and a lot more fun to drive than my wife\\'s Lexus IS 250. The styling and performance are terrific.  More power and better reliability than year models.  One or the other of the tail lights have to be replaced every 6-12 months: I\\'ve now bought the tools and now do it myself. The cup holder is a bit flimsy, and the arm rest storage cover has an easily breakable hinge.     Back seat leg room is very cramped for adults (a non issue for us 2 empty nesters). I just recently discovered the 12 volt socket in the trunk. Ultra Sport with Ultra Repairs Car is gorgeous.  Dolphin grey ext & Black leather int.  Looks like the S4, but with the economy of the 1.8T.  It kills me that Audi makes such beautiful cars but can\\'t make them reliable enough to compete with Japanese cars.  In a year\\'s time, I\\'ve replaced both front window regulators, the clutch, the center armrest, steering control arm, the stereo head unit and now scheduled items are coming up (timing, struts, brakes).  This car only has 65k miles... Japanese typically don\\'t fall apart until twice that.   Audi does make a great car to lease. Only lease... which is unfortunate as most first time Audi buyers probably buy pre-owned and get turned off by the time they make enough to buy new. A *nearly perfect car I purchased this car w/ 44K and now have 79K on it.  You can\\'t beat the tasteful, subtle but sporty styling and the interior design and quality is impeccable.  Apart from the lack of power (170hp in a 3400lb car just can\\'t compare to its rivals in terms of acceleration), but the quattro all-wheel-drive system all but makes up for it in the twisties and it moves like a much lighter, more balanced car.  Like almost all 1.8T owners I\\'ve had to replace my coil packs (I opted to upgrade to aftermarket Hitachi plugs instead of the OEM versions).  A new clutch was also required at 75K, but that may have been due to the previous owner\\'s driving style. I love my car and will drive it until it\\'s dead. Nothing but problems!! Purchased vehicle used with 20k mileage. Ultrasport 1.8T came with APR stage-1 upgrade. Problems with Air bag module. Dealer fixed under warr. Ignition coils went bad cost 500.00 Fuel pump bad along with some type of sensor that regulates the fuel to the engine?? Caused car to dump too much fuel and flood engine. Cost 850.00. Defective coolant seal (Anti Freeze was leaking in the rear of engine) about 1100.00. And of course the famous Timing belt that bent the valves at 85K and defective passenger side window module cost 2300.00 (And that\\'s with my own valve head I received free from a friend). Now the Bank 1 O2 sensor is bad and it\\'s leaking oil like crazy. Dealer said defective oil cap??  Love/Hate Relationship I bought this car w/50k miles on it and it has 89k now. I love driving this car. I love the looks & the interior is awesome. Gas mileage is grt as I avg 26 mpg & get at least 32 on hwy. The hate on this car is reliability issues. I have had coolant leaks, oil leaks, & now the trans is leaving puddles on my garage flr. I have replaced both frt wdw regulators, the fuel pump, 3 of the 4 ign coils on the engine. I have had issues with the air bags & the engine light is on a lot. When it rains the car leaks water in at the A pillar & no one seems to know why. It\\'s in the shop more than my garage. I\\'m scared what it will cost after 100k. I love it, but it\\'s going to have to go. Go back to BMW or Japanese. 1.8T good solid engine Owned since new. No major engine problems ever with this car. Would recommend good aftermarket warranty after 50K miles. Had to replace both front window regulators and 2 coil packs. I have 93,000 miles on the car and I don\\'t baby it. 4cyl turbo w/6speed manual is a gas saver but lacks in power. Opted for APR Stage 1 program upgrade $499 value worth every penny. Car now has about 230hp and 275ft lb of torque and is much more fun to drive. Worst thing about the car is the useless cup holders. Best looking A4 ever IMO. Careful choosing tires for this car, very susceptible to road noise once tires begin to wear. Pirelli P Zero Rosso were the best. Yokohama\\'s handle great but make a lot of noise. great car The ride was fun, always a good experience. Gas mileage is pretty good, and so is just about everything else. Not exceptionally fast, but it does the job well. Best car ever This car is better than any other. Has awesome stereo lots of bass sounds great. Has lots of power from a 1.8 t. Great sport suspension rides as if the car was riding on rails, love the smooth shifting. Really beats any other car. Great gas mileage, comfortable to drive over 1200 miles.  5 years of A4 3.0 AWD Excellent car overall. The original tires Pirrelli 4 season are problems. Had side wall bubbles on all 4. Car has been to the garage only for maintenance and to replace the headlight washer cover which fell off twice. 85,000 miles so far. Also problem with wheels, they tend to hit the curbs when parallel parking due to the curve of the wheel they stick out from the tire. They get scrapped easily. Everything else is awesome, I\\'d buy another. Major Let Down Bought this car used July 4th, 2008. Immaculate condition. No dents, no scraps, everything worked! One month into it, the auto leveling headlghts malfunctioned, power windows failed, Pirelli tires were awful! Then, coil packs failed, engined missfired and had to be towed away! Rattles galore! I love the engine sound, interior style, material quality and over all subtle style. If you\\'re gonna buy this car buy a good after market warranty, and have it inspected thouroughly before purchasing!  Great Second Car I purchased a used 2004 3.0 Quattro with 5 speed auto for a second car.  I\\'m quite impressed with the fit and finish and not a squeak in a car with 59000 miles on it. It\\'s quick, smooth and fun to drive. I had a 2001 BMW 530 and swear this car rides better, feels faster and matches the Bimmer in every comfort category. Only Time Will Tell. I have only owned this car for about 4 1/2 months. And I love the cars design, material quality and control layout. Im very happy with the handeling and even the rather small engine. But there seems to be issues with the windows and rain sensor, there are a few plastic interior rattles that annoy me. The audio system is terrible (Symphony system). I\\'m not disappointed,  Jetta Jettison So I ditched the 08 Jetta. What a piece of junk compared to this car. This car handles better, sounds better, look better, and feels better. I lost a lot of money on the Jetta - I had two, that\\'s right 2 2008 Jettas. They lacked everything this car has and I paid less for this used Ultrasport. I am thoroughly impressed. Good car, expensive to keep The A4 quattro is great however the cost to repair and keep the car is pretty expensive. The windshield wiper arms and control were replaced for 500+ dollars, 4000 dollars worth of repair after rear end collision, torque converter failure at 67000 miles, dead battery after 4 years (134 dollars non Audi battery) I liked the car in the beginning but it got costly to keep especially with premium gas at 4.30+/gal. Also the car was never the same after the accident.  MPG worries? I had concerns since most reviews I found mention an average of about 21-25mpg. I have found that reasonable driving habits have given me a combined average of 32.1mpg on regular gas over the last 20,000 miles! Of course if you bought this car to really drive it you won\\'t do so well, but I was so impressed with the design, quality and ride that I got it to enjoy those features (I drive about 30,000 miles per year and don\\'t race, or even speed much). A buddy of mine who does have a lead foot gets about 21mpg on premium in his 2001 A4 2wd. 2004 silver ultra sports 1.8T When I first saw the car I loved it. It\\'s fun to drive with an all wheel drive system, very comfortable and well built. The only bad thing that I had was the 2 weeks after I got the car the coil pack went out, which mean miss fire on one of the cylinders. Easy fix, and that\\'s the only problem I have, since then it\\'s been a joy ride.  3.0 L A4 FWD CVT I have found my A4 to be an outstanding car. I have been very satisfied with the comfort, reliability, styling and road handling capabilities of the 3 liter FWD. I have to admit the 1st gear off the line in auto sometimes hesitates but a simple fix if you need the get into traffic acceleration is to switch to select manual. There is negligable drop in RPM when in auto at gear changes - if you can feel it-pure acceleration. Fuel ecomony is fine - if you don\\'t dog it and cruise sensibly - below 65 - I have gotten 30 mpg on the highway - 20 in town. The non turbo 3 liter is a great engine.  Frequent repairs I bought this Audi new, within the first year had to go back to the dealer 3 times for faulty airbags. Almost problem free since then, except a few minor issues: non-working headlight cleaners, burnt lights, filter problems. It just came out of warranty (>4 years) and the A/C compressor died, dealer wants to charge $2000 to replace it. I\\'m thinking of trading it since repair costs for this car are exorbitant. Drives very well in snow though! Awsome! I now have had my A4 ultrasport for 4 years and 80000 miles. I have had no major problems. It is an awsome car and it is amazing to drive. I highly recomend this car! Amazing car.  I purchased my A4 back in January of this year after doing extensive research on everything from Acura, Lexus, BMW & Volvo. What truly sets this car apart is the fact it is AWD with luxury and ride comfort that I did not find in any of the above listed models.  The interior styling makes the BMW 3-Series look cheap. I have never found so many compartments for storage in a vehicle like this either.  The handling is amazing I drive in the catskill mountain range in southern NY and can\\'t tell you how amazing this car handles. I\\'ve driven it through ice & snow even at 65mph this car feels like it\\'s riding on rails. Go for a 6-speed manual to maintain a sports sedan feel. Amazing car! JD Low Mileage A4 Original owner of this A4 for the past four years.  Quality and performance are great with decent gas mileage. Audi maintenance covers everything during warranty and dealer\\'s have provided exceptional service. I will buy another Audi in 2009, anxious to see how the trade in value holds. 4-Year Perspective Overall, my 4-year experience with the A4 has been a good one. I concur with the turbo lag mentioned in other reviews on standing starts.  However, at road speeds the turbo is much more responsive.  I have had no mechanical issues with this vehicle that required service.  The sports suspension and quattro make this car a pleasure to drive in any weather conditions.  Traction in heavy snow has been fabulous.  I\\'ve heard a lot of negative stories about the Pirelli tires the 2004 model came with (defects, noise, low tread life), but I have 38,000 miles on mine, and have had no issues. Good car but totally unreliable I really like my 2004 A4 but it has been in the shop too many times.  It had problems with the turbo charger at about 37k miles, then a leaking oil gasket at 45k, ignition coils replaced at 48k and the entire 2nd cylinder head was replaced shortly after that.  Luckily this was done under warranty but I\\'m thinking of selling it now before anything else can go wrong. Probably the best car I have owned Over the 3 and 1/2 years I have owned this car, it has been nearly flawless. One repair under warrantee to replace the catalytic converter.  The 1.8 has sufficient power and delivers excellent gas mileage for an AWD vehicle.  The AWD really delivers in heavy rain and is adequate in snow providing you drive sanely. Drop the 3 and the C, go for an A! I bought my A4 Ultrasport used with about 36000 miles, and since June I\\'ve added another 2500.  I drive all over the the Southeast and I love it, good gas mileage balanced with good performance. I do agree though it lacks in low end torque, nothing a light ecu upgrade can\\'t solve.  I want to design cars, so I\\'m pretty critical when it comes to automobiles.  After driving a E320 for a while, I joined the Audi revolution. In my search, I drove 3 series models, IS 300, C320/230 K, and the T5 Volvo S40. In the end I found the Audi was the best. Cheaper upkeep than the other Germans, and better build quality than Volvo and Lexus.  Join The AUDI revolution! Poor A4 reliability and dealer support In less than 3 years and 26000 miles, we have spent $2600 on repairs to our Audi, $1000 for a door that distorted, $1600 for a clutch that failed.  We also have a broken catch on a glove compartment unfixed so far. Despite the car having a 50,000 mile 4-year warranty, the dealership has steadfastly refused to fix anything under warranty.  From what we can gather, this policy seems to be driven by Audi of America. We will NEVER buy an Audi again.  A4 even better than expected My wife wanted this car more than I did. Not only did she love the design, her bad back loved the seats. I wanted a smaller, less expensive car, something like an Acura TSX or Mazda3, By special ordering a low optioned FWD version, we kept the cost down. It has provided us with 38000 miles of trouble free, comfortable, low operating costs driving.   I am sure that the other choices would not have been as comfortable for long trips nor gotten as a better MPG.  I am more than glad we got the A4! Fantastic Vehicle Purchased the car certified pre-owned about 6 months ago.  I wanted something a bit more mature with more options.  Opted for this car and don\\'t regret a thing. Turbo Lag Turbo lag, turbo lag, turbo lag  The problems I have had with this car start with the fuel pump humming noise. The dealer replaced it twice. As of now no more noise. AC turns off when it feels like it. I live in florida & it get hot here so AC is a must but the A4 AC seems to have a mind of its own. I had a 1996 A4 with the same problem. Now to my biggest complaint. The 1.8t\\'s turbo lag. Say you are in the middle of the intersection waiting for an opening. In the Audi don\\'t even think about creeping in. You better have a big opening by the time you step on the gas and the car reacts its too late.  I\\'d buy it again I took ownership of this car almost three years ago and it\\'s been trouble free the whole time. I love everything from the design to performance. Even though I have the 3.0 model I wish it had a little more power. Other than that it\\'s almost perfect! A4 Fun car to drive and handles well.  Audi and VW can capture drivers on the appearance and handling alone. Don\\'t Buy an Audi My Audi has serious electrical problems (every headlight, tail light, turn signal and now the regulator which controls my power window - $350 to replace - has been replaced at least once) and Audi USA and the dealer don\\'t seem to care. I get \"it happens to every car\" - not any that I owned in the past (Japanese). They\\'re great looking cars and fun to drive, but need too much up-keep for the price. Think of something else before purchasing unless you don\\'t mind dishing out hundreds of $$$ every couple months on things that should never go wrong let alone within the first couple months of owning a brand new, showroom floor car. Not worth the $$$$$ I was looking at the \"new VW Jetta\" at the time, and to get all the things that I wanted cost more that the Audi.  Common sense told me to get the Audi instead.  I had my car for 7 months with no problems.  I was at a stop light when it happened.  The light turned green and I stepped on the gas, and the car would not move.  The check engine light was one, the car was running, but it wouldn\\'t move. After countless trips to the dealer and being told that the car was fixed (and it wasn\\'t) I had to get rid of it.  I hated doing it too. I loved the design of the car, the bose xm radio, tiptronic, and the pure fun to drive feeling.  When the car works it\\'s great, but when it didn\\'t... Exceptional Car...  Couldn\\'t be happier! The A4 is not only great looking and fuel efficient, but it is FUN to drive.  The 170 hp and almost 170 lb feet of torque pack more than enough power.  I get compliments on my car quite frequently.  I am a reformed BMW driver.  I will never go back.  Quattro (the AWD system) has given me newfound confidence when I drive.  Is it just me? Or is it my A4? Longtime lover of the Audi series. Friends all swore by A4\\'s. I finally leased one in 2004. At first I was pleased, coming off of many high end japanese vehicle leases, but I have now been in the shop with a lot of little issues. Started out with driver\\'s power window not closing. Then water leaks in dashboard window which led to freezing ice in winter on the INSIDE. (blamed on water drains clogged?!) Window broken again. Now a/c doesn\\'t work and transmission not shifting properly on hills. Anyone else have these issues or just me? I love my car and I\\'m saddened by all the time it spends in the shop.  Even better than I expected We liked many things about the A4, but the seat comfort that sealed the deal. Had to order an unloaded model to keep cost under $30K. I worried about reliability issues, but with 18K miles the only issue has been an improperly installed headrest. We go 5 hours non stop & our 55 year old bodies have nary a complaint. Power is adequate at under 2,500 rpms, more than adequate over 2,500 - passes with ease.  Biggest surprise is gas mileage (relatively conservative driving habits). 33-36 mpg on highway & 26-28 in urban driving. Great balance between ride & cornering, feels heavy & a bit mushy in a fast, tight turns, but great & no complaints for daily driving. CVT very smooth & slick. A4 with sports package I have owned several cars including my most recent, a 2002 BMW 325i.  Overall, I would rate this A4 as the best car I have owned.  The exterior and especially the interior styling cannot be beat in this price range.  I have the sports package with the interior aluminum trim and love it - very sporty and classy at the same time.  Also, I love the lower profile, sleek look with the sports package.  The ride suffers a bit with it as to be expected and there is not much noticeable improvement in handling IMHO,  but still worth it for the look. Best Car I\\'ve Ever Driven The Audi A4 is the most underestimated car on the market.  I have always been drawn to its understated elegance, but in the past 3 years, Audi has really stepped up and started grabbing the attention of people who want luxury cars, but don\\'t want to clone every other \"wannabe\" in that market.  I have the A4 1.8T Quattro, Ultra Sport edition of the car.  I have every possible option avaliable.  It is the best car I have ever driven to be honest and I know I will be an Audi owner for life!  Perfect Car Traded in my 2001 Audi A4 quattro 5 speed for a 2004 A4 1.8T quattro 6 speed. I didn\\'t opt for the sport package that was on my 2001 model.  This made for a softer smoother ride which is nice since most driving is done sensibly and not pushing the limits (though that is amazingly fun in this car too). The 6 speed transmission is a must, it keeps the RPM\\'s down at highway speeds. I never had any troubles with my 2001 model and have not experienced any so far with my 2004. It is fun to drive, a better value than BMW, and sportier then Mercedez-Benz.  This is the perfect car! It\\'s a German car, not  a Lexus  Can out handle any Jap car. If you love  all in all satisfied but not perfect I\\'ve driven a dolphin grey quatro A4 \\rfor about 7 months which now has \\r14,000 miles.  The only car I measured \\rit up to before purchase was a BMW \\r325.  All in all I am very satisfied \\rabout my purchase however the driver \\rside window sometimes rolls back down \\ron its own when I push it to roll up.  \\rOther than that no problems worth \\rnoting.  I feel very safe in this car \\rfor me and my family. Ultra-Sport is a must I love this car.  It\\'s beautiful on the  Former Jetta owner Glad I got the 6 speedM.  Very Fun to \\rdrive, great fit/finish, great looking \\respecially the interior.  Drags a bit \\rin the low end but keeping it reved up \\rhelps and on the highway great \\racceleration and excellent road \\rhandling.  Quiet and stereo sounds \\rgreat. Get the XM sat. especially if \\ryou take longer road trips.  Best \\rinvention since...the Wheel?..well \\ralmost.  Good storage w convenient  \\rrear split.  \\r On the bad side..just quibbles \\rreally......the cup holders...come on \\rAudi everything else so \"german\" and \\rsensible.  Cupholders in armrest are \\runiversally acknowledged/useless M \\rversion/dash cupholder should have a \\rred flag warning as cups and bottles \\rleap out! Very nice, but could use more oomph I find the 1.8t A4 quattro to be a very \\rcomfortable and fun car to drive.  \\rWhile not a complete dog, the 1.8 liter \\rfour is a little underpowered for this \\rcar\\'s weight.  The six-speed shifts \\rnicely and helps keep things more \\rlively, but there is no substitute for \\rmore grunt.  The interior finish is \\rimpeccable, the controls work well, and \\rthe quattro system helps in the \\rcorners.  I am concerned about the long-\\rterm reliability.  My car has just over \\r1000 miles and is rattling in the \\rback ... I hope it will not be \\rproblematic. The Audi Experience I purchased my vehicle 4 months ago. It \\rhas spent 2 weeks and going in the shop \\rwith an electrical problem. Audi of \\rAmerica has brought no value to resolve \\rthe issue or expediate the repair of \\rthis $35,000 paper weight. It\\'s a \\rbeautiful car if you don\\'t have a \\rdesire in driving it. Overall, the car \\rhad been a fun driving vehicle despite \\rthe cramp quarters. More power please! This is my second A4 (3.0 black ext, \\rblack int, with ultra sport package and \\rall options except nav).  The car is \\rsuperb in almost every way - e.g. \\relegant exterior lines; understated, \\rluxuriously appointed cabin; superior \\rstorage; and authoritative passing \\rpower.  The only realy fault of the car \\ris its not entirely adequate 220hp 3.0 \\rengine. While not anemic, this power \\rplant simply does not have enough \\rmuscle to move the A4\\'s considerable \\rweight with any alacrity, especially at \\rstarts and lower city speeds (0-45 mph) \\rwhere it cooperates but not very \\rwillingly and with way too much drama. \\rConsidering the S4 is USD 12k plus \\raway, the A4 needs more uumph. Awesome car and fun to drive This car is so much fun and performs \\rgreat.  I looked at Volvo S60, BMW \\r325i, and Saab 9-3 Arc this was bye \\rfar the best value of these cars.  I \\rhave 6-speed so the performance is \\rexcellent and I don\\'t think you can \\rget any better car for the money. audi a4 ultrasport Tremendous vehicle to drive and \\rpractical as well. Previously owned \\rPassat with same engine. The Audi is \\rmuch more fun to drive and gives great \\rconfidence with the quattro all-wheel \\rdrive. Beautiful subdued styling with \\rall the things you need, but nothing \\ryou don\\'t. awesome so far The car has performed perfectly so  You are in for a treat! While searching for a new car, I looked \\rat the 3-series, G35, and A4.  I have \\rnot regretted my decision!  Gearshifts \\rare flawless, turbo gives me power when \\rI need a boost, road grip and driver \\rresponse are excellent, craftmanship is \\rfirst rate, aesthetically pleasing \\r(inside and out), standard sound system \\ris better than BMW\\'s harmon kardon \\rpremium, excellent warranty (1st pair \\rof brake pads, oil changes, servicing \\rare all free), and its turning radius \\rhelps me corner through the small \\rstreets in SF!  I test drove the 3.0 as \\rwell and besides the 0-60 and top-line \\racceleration, there is little \\rdifference.   Great Car This is an excellent vehicle.  Got the \\r1.8T 6 speed manual Quattro with the \\rsport package.  Car has great pickup if \\ryou rev. the engine up to 3000 rpm\\'s.  \\rCould use more low end torque and a few \\rextra horsepower (225 Turbo would be \\rperfect).  Was thinking about the 3.0, \\rbut would lose that horsepower in \\rhigher elevation (I live in CO).  The \\rcar is solid, and has an excellent \\rinterior.  Have had it for 3 1/2 months \\rnow and no problems.  Bose sound system \\ris great.  Leather interior feels \\rgreat, and the car handles like a \\rdream.  The car grips the road like no \\rother, even in the rain.  Let the snow \\rfall! Gotta Get the Ultrasport Ultrasport package gets looks from \\reveryone!  6 spd manual gets the car \\rup and going, and performance is great \\rconsidering the gas milliage.  \\rBrilliant Red is just that...simply \\rstated. Great Car The Audi A4 3.0Q /6M has been a great \\rcar overall the past year. There is a \\rgood balance of power, stability and \\rcomfort with the vehicle during any \\rdriving condition. The enhacned \\rstiffness of the frame for these model \\ryears have improved interior feel and \\rperception of a solid, well built car;\\rWhich, no doubt, the A4 is. The A4 is \\rin my opinion the best buy for its \\rprice range. The True Review The car\\'s 1.8liter and 4 cylinder \\rengine with a 170HP sound worse than \\rthe actual performance that comes out.  \\rI previously owned a Nissan Maxima 6 \\rcylinder and the audi from 0 to 60 \\rleaves the maxima in the dust.  \\rHowever, the car reaches higher rpms \\rmuch faster and begs the driver for \\rquick shifting.  The handling is \\rexcellent, however after 6 months with \\rthe car, the front struts and axls are \\rcreeky.  In addition, the car has begun \\rto make louder idle noises.  The maxima \\ris as quiet as a pussycat.  Overall, it \\ris difficult to compare the two being \\rin different categories and the \\rsacrifices that I made switching to a \\rsmaller car (interior is small). Great Car. BAD Quality Experience. New A4 1.8T Ultraport loaded.  have a \\rquality prob out of the shoot.BAD for a \\r$37K MSRP car. W/in 4 hrs of delivery, \\rthe power steering failed due to a \\rleak.  The dealer repaired but did not \\rreplace the hose as promised. I was out \\rthe car overnight to get that hose. I \\rdid get rental/loaner.  W/in 4 hours of \\rpick up after repair. The prob ocurred \\rAGAIN! The car is back at the dealer. \\rI\\'m in a loaner. Fix = replace the \\rENTIRE strg rack. Replmt parts arrived, \\r1/2 way into install...parts deemed \\rfaulty.I am still w/out that new car, \\rsoon a lemon in this state. Buying a \\rnew car should not be this way. No \\rExcuse Audi!!! Absolutely love my 1.8T Ultra Sport I looked very hard at the \\rVolvo S60, Acura TL, and BMW 3 \\rseries.  Audi without a doubt offered \\rthe best bang for the buck and in my \\ropinion, nothing beats the A4\\'s \\rhandling with Quattro.  Plus once I \\rgot a look at the Ultra Sport package \\rthat sealed the deal.  I can not count \\rhow many times people have commented \\ron the look of my car.  I have had the \\rcar 2 months now and have not had a \\rsingle problem. Finally, I \\ram very impressed with the gas mileage. 1.8 Turbo w/6 spd  The turbo lag is noticable, but winding \\rthe engine up, even just a little, on \\rtake off takes care of this.  The 6 \\rspeed also helps quicken the car up a \\rgreat deal as compared to the \\rautomatic.  We went with the Sport \\rPackage which does make the ride firm, \\rbut mini vans and SUV\\'s really become \\rannoying on on and off ramps :) Ultra Sport Get the ultra sport package at all \\rcost! This is the difference maker \\r(look-wise). I lowered suspension, 18\" \\rwheels and aluminum trim make the A4 a \\rbeautiful piece of machinery. I got my \\rA4 through Costco\\'s automotive program \\r(Beverly Hills Audi). I saved over \\r$2000. Learn about it Got my red hottie on a sweet lease. The\\r1.8 is better on gas and fast enough for\\rme. Don\\'t know why you need more, the\\rlow end torque is nice and the turbo is\\rnot that bad. I really thought about the\\rS4, but really...do who needs to go that\\rfast with a $50K car. Mine gets the\\rlooks and is great. Was looking at\\rAcura, MB, BMW, MINI, Infiniti, Lexus,\\rbut there\\'s something about the security\\rof the quattro taking a highway curve at\\r80mph and feeling like you are on rails\\reven in the rain.\\r Oh yeah for jess saland down there, my\\rgas door locks when the doors lock, you\\rmight check that. Right Brain Meets Left Brain This car has probably the best combination of \\rattributes among sports sedans that will \\rappeal to both right-brained and left-brained \\rpeople.  For left brainers, there\\'s the super-\\rsmooth, cutting-edge CVT transmission that \\rdoesn\\'t sap engine power to achieve creamy \\rsmoothness (I previously drove sticks); \\rabsence of torque steer; superb handling and \\rvalue versus BMW (I paid the same for this as I \\rdid for a 2001 BMW 325i with fewer options  \\rand smaller engine).  For right-\\rbrainers,there\\'s the clean exterior lines with \\ran aesthetically superior interior design and \\rquality of materials that can\\'t be matched in \\rany price class.  2004 Audi A4 - A LEMON! My AUDI A4 is on the brink of \"lemon\" \\rclassification -- it has been in the \\rshop for 22 days. I bought the car just \\r6 months ago and sadly, I\\'ve had \\rproblems with it for the past 3 months. \\rAccording to the service center, it is \\rnot safe to drive. It shakes violently \\rand for some unfortunate reason, always \\rdecides to buck when coming to a stop. \\rThe transmission part needed is on back \\rorder & Audi has no idea when it will \\rarrive. Apparently \"tracking systems\" \\rare not part of Audi\\'s lexicon. I \\rhighly advise anyone interested in \\rpurchasing this vehicle to do plenty of \\rresearch on the CVT system and think \\rtwice before going down this path.  Great Car! I love it. Enough said! Now let\\'s go  an awesome car This car seems that it will last  audi a4 quatro The Audi is so much fun to drive I stay  2004 A4 Quattro 6M Wonderful to drive, bought because it \\rwill seat 5 (4 adults, 1 child)and \\raverage over 30mpg.  Test drove many \\rothers before purchasing and love this \\rcar.  4 yr-50,000 mile warranty didn\\'t \\rhurt either.  Very well laid out \\rinterior, Bose XM stereo is awesome!  \\rAll wheel drive handles well on wet or \\rdry roadways.  I\\'m 6\\'3\" tall 230lbs. \\rand it fits me well.  Plenty of power \\rfrom turbo.  Did add a rear spoiler to \\rset it apart from other A4s. Wow I have been a Volkswagen owner for the \\rlast 6 years and I just bought my \\rfirst Audi. It is simply an extension \\rof the quality the Volkswagen puts in \\rtheir complete line. It\\'s a great \\rcar!! The handling is superb and the \\rinterior is even better!! I compared \\rwith BMW and bang for the buck, Audi \\ris a better buy in the upscale \\rcategory. For all of those of you who \\rare looking for a family car or those \\rof you who are single active people, \\rthe A4 Avant is certainly the best \\rwagon out there. Get one, you won\\'t be \\rdissapointed!! ultra sport ultra sport pkg really sets this car \\rapart from the rest. Cannt say enough \\rabout the quattro system, this car \\rcorners. BETTER than $BMW$ This car has it all.  For any would be \\r3 series buyers out there, do the test \\rdrive and try in vain to match the \\rsuperb performance. ExtremeCar This car has the best interior quality  NewAudiOwner This is my first Audi as well as the \\rfirst car under my name. It truly makes \\rdriving fun and what really sold me was \\rthe sleek classy look of the interior. \\rAfter driving this vehichle for only 5 \\rmonths and 7000 mi I have already \\rdecided that I am going to treasure it \\rfor at least the next 93000 mi. and am \\rconfident that it will be able to \\rhandle the miles with little too no out \\rof pocket $$$. Regardless, my next \\rvehicle will be an Audi as well. \\rPerhaps the Le Mons series! My new audi is awesome I absolutely love this car. It is  Audi Audit Announcement I just purchased the Audi 3.0 convertible. This is my first used car! I previously have had 2 Touregs, Tiguan, Passat Wagon, Yukon Denali. I love this car! It has been gently loved prior to my owning the vehicle. It has been reliable and the perfect commuter vehicle. I need dependability because I work in a very demanding medical organization . Bitter Sweet I came across a \"too good to be true\" deal on a 2003 1.8t Convertible which I roughly invested $2500 into. First thing that went bad was the Ignition coil. ($1,200 repair for 2 coils) which now I know will cost under $200 to replace all 4 (Thanks to YouTube and AutoZone.) Second thing gone bad was the drivers side CV Joint ($500 inluding towing and went bad again because I bought a cheap replacement) Now with my 3 month visit to the pothole capital, NYC, Ive replaced ALL front control arms which were already bad and Drivers Side CV Joint ($491 on ECS Tuning and $500 Labor at Lennys Auto Service in Brighton beach and I AM SO SO HAPPY with the results. This car is a dream to drive and a keeper I wish I never bought this car! I bought my A4 in November of 2006 with 33K miles and now have 64K on it. I live in New England and wanted a 4 wheel drive sedan. In the three years I have owned the car I\\'ve replaced the windshield wiper motor twice ($500 each) and the windshield washer pump once!  I\\'ve also had to replace the  the rack and pinion steering, all 6 ignition cylinders, timing belt and water pump (Audi recommendation = $1200), brakes.  I\\'m at the point I\\'m afraid to drive the car on any long trips and use it as little as possible.  I\\'ll be trading it in soon for a Honda Civic (going to take a hit on the trade in value and what I owe) but I just can\\'t afford to keep the Audi.    Perfect combination ... I have owned several convertibles from Triumphs to Mercedes, I have never had one as perfect as the Audi A4 Cabrio. Imagine a car that treats you well when cruising the boulevard and at the same time lets you throw it into a corner at heart pounding speeds. A car that handles like a sports car but lets you take 3 friends along for the ride. Ar car that makes your 10 wife look like an 11 and gets you all the looks you need. PERFECT. Lemonade on Wheel First of all, this is the worst car I\\'ve ever owned. Second of all, the worst car I ever owned...now you got my point. At 57k miles replaced the CVT transmission ($8K), CV boot 4x, headlight every 3-6months, it goes on. Never will ever buy or own an Audi again, worst than Yugo and I\\'d rather drive a Pacer. 2003 Audi A4 convertible I just purchased a 2003 A4 convertible a few weeks ago.   So far I really enjoy driving the car, especially with the top down.   It has a little turbo lag but once you get going,  it\\'s very smooth.   Overall,  I really like this car and would recommend it if you want a fun convertible with a back seat.  The back seat is small, however, and can only fit two young children I would say.   Never buy an Audi After owning a 1998 A4 1.8T quatro, and an older Porsche Boxster I traded them both in due to age not condition for this A4 Cabriolet. What a mistake! After 8 months of ownership the car has been in the shop for a variety of problems ranging from electrical problems with the fuel injection system, to stupid items like the front windshield fogging up in the summer with the A/C on and top up. The car constantly has an issue with it to the point that you cannot enjoy it. You\\'re always waiting for the next issue to occur. Audi has gotten over confident of their product since 98 and the quality is now very poor. I would recommend you look elsewhere for a vehicle in this price range.  Love it I bought this car for my wife and an S6 Avant for myself. Both are great cars. I have driven 8 Mercedes cars in the 20 years prior and now you couldn\\'t get me to buy one if they went on sale for 25% off.  I only wish I had waited and gotten quattro in the A4 Cabriolet. It was not offered at the time I purchased the \\'03. Also...I would have been happy with the later issued A 4S Cab. My S 6 Avant has spoiled me.  I can\\'t wait to buy my next one...and think I may get an A3 for my son\\'s college graduation. Audi rocks One Great Car!! I love to drive this vehicle.  It is my first convertible.  No Hassles, just push a button to open and close top.   Best Cabriolet Ever Driven or Made This cabriolet with the 3.0L power plant and the awesome handling of the Audi suspension and body design has been very impressive.  We have driven a lot of highway miles on it and find it to be comfortable at the end of a 700 mile day, quite a statement for a sports rated vehicle and unlike any that we have had before.  If you buy one beware it is addictive.  If you have one you already know.   I hate my car!!! This car is loud, has no power, and it\\rhandles like a truck. Audi service is\\rpoor. I have received better service\\rfrom  General Motors, Honda and Toyota\\rdealers.\\rDo yourself a favor and buy a CLK320\\rfrom   Mercedes. awesome best car ever driven!!!! Fast and Fun, off the dial After comparing BMW 330, Saab 9-3 \\rVolvo S90 I purchased the A4 3.0. with \\rfull package except nav and sport. \\rFound the sport option made the car \\rtoo road stiff and the nav was more \\rconfusing than it was worth. Driven \\rfull out with governor off, speedo \\rmaxed out and then some, It moves \\rwell. If you want to burn rubber at \\rstart then use the triptronic shifter, \\rothwerwise the CVT is smooth. Overall \\rhave had several high end autos, this \\ris one of the best. Poorly Built Car We have had our Audi for less than a \\ryear and it is one problem after \\ranother.  We the car arrived the \\rconvertible top was coming apart at \\rthe seams on the interior.  It took a \\rweek to repair.  Then the compartment \\rin the trunk (used for storing the \\rroof) broke and it took 2 trips to \\rrepair it.  Last time it was in for \\rservice they found a \"small\" \\rtransmission fluid leak.  Two months \\rlater, it is in again and now they \\rhave to replace the transmission!  \\rWorst made car we\\'ve ever purchased!!!! Great Rag Top Fast, fun, sporty.  Comfortable.  CVT \\ris wonderful, makes for smooooth \\rdriving.  Drive with top down Apr.-Oct. Can\\'t wait for my 2nd summer! I had the top down today on the first \\rday of spring in Chicago, and even the \\ranti-war protesters on Michigan Ave \\rgave admiring glances. I have 6600 \\rmiles on my red A4 cab since 12/02, \\rmostly short hops in the city. No \\rproblems with the car at all - fit and \\rfinish were as good as my prior new \\rcars, a Nissan 200SX and a Lexus \\rSC300.    I would recommend this car \\rwithout hesitation. I considered the \\rBMW 330i, the MB CLK 320, the Infiniti \\rG35 coupe, and a few otehr import \\rconvertibles, and still believe that \\rthe A4 is the best combination of \\rstyle, performance, and value. awesome experience Most fun you can have with your clothes \\ron. Incredible ride. Joy to drive!! \\rBetter than BMW, Mercedes, etc. \\rIncredible value. Loving it! Bought my first convertible three \\ryears after moving to CA from NY. \\rSecond Audi and I picked it over the \\rBMW, Saab and Mercedes for the style \\rand build quality (the Mercedes, \\respecially, felt very cheap).  I don\\'t \\rfind it as sluggish as some reviewers, \\rbut didn\\'t test roadsters, so have no \\rbasis for comparison.  The fit and \\rfinish are exceptional and the seating \\rsurprisingly comfortable (I\\'m 6\\'2\") \\rfor a convertible. Overall, very \\rimpressive car.  Great engineering! 2003 Audi A-4 cabriolet-close to perfect I chose Audi over BMW mainly because of \\rstyling and performance. The BMW has \\rbecome boring looking to me, and there \\rare too many of them on the road. The \\rAudi has a crisper look and feel. The \\rinterior is more luxurious, and the \\rseats are more supportive. The CVT \\rtransmission takes some getting used \\rto. It is not as fast off the line as \\rthe BMW, but the absence of any \\rnoticeable shifting is very luxurious \\rfeeling. Side by side, the Audi A-4 \\rjust has it all over the BMW. CAUTION: \\rBUY ONLY THE 3.0 V-6. The 1.8 is \\rhopelessly underpowered. BUY THIS CAR. \\rYou\\'ll love it!\\r    I love going topless! This is the first convertible I have \\rowned and I love it, especially the one \\rbutton ease of raising and lowering the \\rtop. The interior is gorgeous (red \\rleather with black dash, headliner and \\rcarpet). The CVT is silky smooth and \\rproduces surprisingly good gas mileage \\rfor a V-6 engine. The Bose stereo \\rsystem is terrific. The trunk is very \\rgenerous for a convertible. The back \\rseat is roomy. It can seat two people \\rcomfortably. I love the car\\'s exterior -\\r it is truly beautiful. Nice Near-Luxury Compromise Convertible I went with 3x black with \\reverything \\'cept the navigation. Car is \\ra nice compromise if you want a \\rstylish, sporty conv., but need the \\rback seat (kids) and a smoother, quiet \\rride than a roadster. MUST adjust the \\rsteering wheel and seat if adult sits \\rin the back. Car is not 2 fast off the \\rline due 2 it\\'s weight. Extra structure \\rmakes the car solid & quiet.  I\\'ll \\rprobably switch 2 a roadster once my \\ryoungest is older.  Drove Z3, MR2 \\rSpider, C70, Honda, etc.  This car \\rbeats them for driving comfort, but \\rdoesn\\'t have that shot-out-of-a-canon \\rfeel...  It beats the Lexus for \\rdesign. Had problems \\rwith the rear windows not going down \\rthe whole way. Fun, but can improve Beautiful shape and ideas. Also, \\rbeautiful build quality. Engine is \\rvery responsive, steering very \\raccurate and great brakes. Seats very \\rsupportive and multitude adjustments \\rmake for comfortable driving \\rposition.Handling, with regular \\rsuspension a little too bouncy.  This car Rocks! This is a great car! Plenty of get up  what a car! my audi A4 1.8T Cabriolet is one of the most \\rfun cars i\\'ve ever owned.  long trips are no \\rproblem, as the car just takes care of the \\rroad, and the interior appointments make \\rsitting for a few hours pass in no time.  \\rterrific seats!  economically, it is a great \\rvalue, and the milage is pretty good, too.  \\rthe audi is quick and civilized, and turns \\rheads like nobody\\'s business.  buy one and \\rhave a blast! Love it! So beautiful and so much fun to drive!\\rGreat steering, great braking. Hesitates\\rout of the gate, but makes up for it\\ronce you\\'re sailing along. Great Car in Need of a Few Minor Fixes Have had the A4 V6 Cabriolet for 3 \\rmonths. Very enjoyable to drive, and \\rvery tightly built. Have had a number \\rof convertibles before, but this is \\rthe first 4 seater. Tested the BMW 3 \\rseries convertible and the Merc 320 \\rclk convertible the Audi was the best \\rallrounder. Good room in the rear with \\rgood leg room and a good size trunk \\r(for a convertible) even with the top \\rdown.  oustanding fabulous car, i\\'ve owned many differnt \\rcars over the years and i must say audi \\rhas been one of my favorites.  Love my Audi Cabriolet I love my Audi Cabriolet convertible.  \\rIt has beautiful lines, is well \\rmanufactured. I\\'ve received multiple \\rcompliments on the car.\\r I miss my Quattro. The handling is not \\ras crisp as my A6 with Quattro. The \\rsuspension is too springy. I love the \\rCVT transmission!\\r Raising and lowering the top is simple. \\rThe cars lines remain beautiful because \\rthe top disappears into the trunk. I \\rput the top down every chance I get as \\ra result.\\r The trunk is large when the top is up & \\rnot too small when the top is down. \\r The GPS uses CDs rather than DVDs & \\rrequires 11.  The CD changer is in the \\rtrunk and is inconvenient. You must get \\rout of the car to change a CD.   Understated Elegance I\\'ve had my Moro Blue Beauty for less \\rthan 24 hours, and I\\'ve already put 250 \\rmiles on her.  So far, it\\'s \\rmet/exceeded my expectations.  The 1.8T \\rwith CVT is surprisingly strong (and I \\rused to drive a Lexus IS300).  With the \\rtop up, the cabin is serene.  Top down \\rride is comfortable.  My only regret is \\rthat my car came with the Sports \\rPackage -- the stiffer suspension may \\rcause unnecessary squeaks and rattles, \\respecially in a convertible. Great ride! Very pleased with the aesthetic, \\rperformance, and ride! CVT is terrifac \\rdespite my initial misgivings. Big time fun Just got our new 2004 puppy, love at \\rfirst sight, great handling , zippy \\rhighway performance, no miles but still \\rgetting 26mpg. top operation is a \\rsnap \"1 finger\" confort plus in the \\rseats,even with back problems this car \\ris confortable. Would recommend to \\ranyone who wants a class act \\rconvertable. Head turner! Great car (this is our second Audi) \\rand my wife loves it.  It will be her \\rdily driver and she\\'s captivated by \\rit.  The CVT tranny though results in \\ra VERY slow pick up as you initially \\raccelerate.  Once moving, this car is \\rimpressive in all areas for \\ra \\'cruiser\\' and a blast to drive.  In \\rtwo weeks, we have 1800 miles on it.   A4 CONVERTIBLE A WINNER IT\\'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND BEST  Just awesome Test drove a Sebring conv the week  outstanding drop top Audi has built an outstanding vehicle \\rwhich is every inch a performance car \\ras well. Fun to drive,good stlying and \\rlots of innovations. So far we have \\renjoyed every mile we driven this \\rAudi!!  A4 3.0 Cabriolet After driving 7K in this new car It is  Great Car! A smooth ride, even with the sport \\rsuspension.  Effortless operation (one \\rtouch) of the convertible top. Great auto Puttting the top down on this car is a  A4 1.8 T Cab is great fun Just a great little car...fun to drive, \\rwith amazingly responsive clutchless 6-\\rspeed, easily switchable to automatic.  \\rHandles great, looks great, and \\rhandling the convertible is push-button \\rsimple.  I think it\\'s the best deal in \\rit\\'s class. couldn\\'t be happier i owned Saab 9-3...what a difference. Audi A4 Cabrio - Awesome! Just got one of these babies and I \\rcannot stop driving it.  The beauty is \\rstunning in moro blue with platinum \\rleather.  The handling and power are \\raccurate and exciting.  From someone \\rwho has always had a straight shift- \\rthis car is not a compromise.  And the \\rtop- while one, you would never know \\rthis was a convertible.  But with a 20 \\rsecond press of a button, bamm! You\\'re \\rout in the open.  Surprisingly little \\rcockpit wind even at highway speeds.  \\rIf you are looking for a luxorious but \\rnot pretencious, sporty auto, look no \\rfurther. Audi  Fun This is the funest car I have ever \\rdrove . I have owned BMW,s and Other \\rAmerican Sports cars but really enjoy \\rthis car. The handling of the car is \\rsimply amazing. Ach du lieber!   My first ever convertible, and man, \\rwhat a ride.  Very good detail \\rthroughout the entire car - even the \\rtop is insulated inside.  Tested this \\rnext to an A6 Sedan, and this has the \\rfun factor all over the sedan.  Very \\rquiet - both through the roof/windows \\rand in the tires/road noise.  Excellent \\rhandling.  The CVT transmission is very \\rsmooth, and the Multitronic \\rtransmission option is very fun.  Has \\rgood weight for a small car which adds \\rto the handling.     My 5th and best Audi!!! Traded a 2003 A4 1.8t with sport  2003 A4 Audi Cabriolet 1.8T Just picked mine up on friday. What \\rcan I say but this is one fun car. It \\rhandles great, gets great gas mileage \\rand it can seat 4 people. I love \\reverything about this car. In one word \\rthis car is awesome. Great convertible cruiser... The Audi offers the best cabin by a \\rmile - its interior quality is the best \\rin this company. The only let-down was \\rthe persistent creaky noise that came \\rfrom the convertible top in my test \\rdrive car, which had about 3k miles on \\rit. But that\\'s something bound to \\rhappen with all convertibles sooner or \\rlater, and usually can be fixed with a \\rlittle WD40.\\r Dynamically, the Audi seems \\rsurprisingly sluggish at times. A look \\rat the car\\'s weight figure gives a hint \\ras to why that might be the case. On \\rthe other hand, that weight results in \\ra very planted, very good ride. It\\'s \\rthe least crashy in this company.\\r WOW! This car is amazing!  It provides \\reverything it claims.  It is fun to \\rdrive, sexy, and much more car for \\ryour money than the competition.  Audi \\rwill be the brand of all my future \\rvehicles. Fun Car A-4 1.8T is a dailey commuter. It has \\rbeen a definite head turner and people \\rcome into wife\\'s office to ask her \\rabout it. She loves the comfortable \\rseats, style and it\\'s a RED convertible. What a Dream Car My new Audi A4 Cabrio is beyond my \\rdreams.  I had an A4 sedan on order, \\rbut fell in love with this cabrio on \\rthe lot, and am so impressed with the \\rvehicle.  The engine is powerful, yet \\rquiet.  The new CVT transmission is so \\rsmooth on acceleration.  \\rThe top mechanics are typically high \\rquality german design, and makes the \\rvehicle feel like a hard top coupe with \\rthe top up.  Trunk space is limited \\rwith the top down, but not too bad. what a ride Just got the car last month.  \\rAwesome!!  Had some aftermarket \\rperformance enhancement done by Joe \\rHoppen in Sarasota...now the 1.8T \\rdelivers 220hp and 230lb-ft torque.  \\rThe CVT is awesome-so smooth, although \\rI also have driven the stick (wonderful \\ras well).  Premium sound system \\rphenomenal.  When I drive normally, I \\raverage over 30mpg. Beautiful  and Refined An absolutely stunning convertable. \\rWhen topless, wind and noise levels are \\rpleasantly low. With the top up, \\rcomfort is comperable to a sedan, which \\ris a good thing. The roof is even lined \\ron the inside! The interior design and \\ramenities are lavish, logical, and \\rperfect to the touch. Audi is clearly a \\rclass leader when it comes to fit and \\rfinish. The 3.0 V6 married to the high-\\rtech Multitronic transmission results \\rin smooth acceleration. Power is \\rsurprisingly plentiful and fuel \\refficient for such a heavy car (3800 \\rlbs). Only regret is that I didn\\'t get \\rthe Sport Package (which will be \\rremedied with after-market springs). Door is solid  Judge cars not by their price, but \\rtheir quality, but for this car, it \\rkicks ass in both department!!! 106K miles and no problems yet My A4 wagon has been the best vehicle I\\'ve owned.  It\\'s comfortable, get\\'s great gas mileage, and looks like a million bucks.  I perform regular maintenance like changing the oil and brakes, timing belt at 100K, etc, and the car takes care of the rest.  Only once did I have a trouble (engine stuttering) and the cost to fix the issue was $150.  I bought this car used and the value for the price has been incredible.  It\\'s safe and peppy.  I have no complaints.   Reliable and fun for 180,000 miles! I\\'ve been driving this car 120 miles round trip to work every day along with taking the family all around town and it has been fantastic! I\\'ve done nothing but scheduled maintenance over the last eight years.  And it\\'s not your average station wagon.  I scream by those monster SUVs on the high ways.  The best part is driving in the snow.  On a day when every car was unable to get up a steep road, only I reached the top out of about 50!  My only disappointment is that I can\\'t replace this car since the Avant no longer comes in stick.  Thank god I can rely on this car for many more miles! Too expensive to own out of warranty My Avant 3.0 quatro is a great driver\\'s car, but it is too expensive to own once the warranty expired. Fuel injection system, numerous ignition coils, power steering unit ($2,350), windshield wiper motor, etc. With just 65,000 miles, you have to question the benefit-value relationship of hanging on to a car with reliability problems. Love my Avant Been an awesome car, bought with 77K on it and now has 113K.  Still running strong, I like to wrench on the car as a hobby and have saved lots of money. I\\'ve  done the timing belt as a precaution.  The only repairs I\\'ve had to do is disassemble the wiper motor which had frozen, a pain to do. I\\'ve also had to fix the rear main coolant flange, a cheap part.  I have had a few coil packs go on me and I carry a spare.  It\\'s two min fix if one goes.  I only use Audi Synthetic Oil  and Audi fluids as well.  I suggest if you buy an Audi, check out  one of many Audi Forums. There are DIY write ups for nearly every repair.  Original clutch is still holding strong too.  Great handling...poor reliability I\\'ve owned this A4 for 2 years now and I am still not sure about Audi. I really like the car handling in all conditions. The Quattro system is excellent in all conditions. However, the engine power together with the auto transmission feels short on acceleration ability. Gas mileage could be better (23 mpg overall) for a car this size. I was disappointed with the reliability of this car but even more with the ability from Audi dealerships to find the issues. They replaced the throttle assembly 3 times (!) before thinking the issue could come from somewhere else (cracked plastic cover that messed the ECM box). I also had to replace the steering rack (leak) and two noisy wheel bearings (rear). Nice car, but too many problems This car is great when it is working. Unfortunately, it\\'s spent too much time in the shop. It\\'s had engine failure (engine stalled in the middle of the street), air conditioning failure, the stereo kept going mono for the first three years, all brakepads had to be replaced, back windscreen cracked, driver\\'s power window motor failure, alarm siren failed, indicator light failed, engine oil stick broke, sunroof didn\\'t open/close properly- the list goes on, all within the first 5 years. I can\\'t recommend Audi to anyone.  Good engine - bad everything else This car has had so many electrical problems I can\\'t even remember all of them. Parking lights each went out one at a time requiring separate visit to dealership for each one. Bad design caused moisture to corrode the contacts. Sunroof was opening on its own and dealer finally found problem after 2 years. Headlight alignment warning light came on, was fixed and now is coming on again after out of warranty. Stereo speakers are shorted out and intermittent. Also, back window just fell out one day. Engine is good but even it had sludge issue and took three days to repair. Hood latch gets jammed and won\\'t open. Cupholder problems - not big enough and won\\'t even pop out of back seat armrest. Great AWD Car The only real car to get if you want a sporty AWD car that hauls like an SUV but gets 25 mpg.  I love the looks and build quality of the A4 Avant.  I literally can not think of another car that I would pick right now to replace it.  Get the Bose, it\\'s awesome, save your money on the Nav, it\\'s just okay.   Not worth the electrical problems My first Avant overheated 3 times in the first two weeks due to a fan control module issue.  After  2 1/2 months in repair the computer module was replaced and the heat only worked at 100 plus degrees.  At my request, Audi replaced the car and charged me $4,000 for a newer car with less equipment.  The first day of the 2nd Avant had the sunroof opening by itself (new switch) and the headlights turning themselves off 3 times over the next 24 months.  The computer calls this a \"dipped headlight\" but it translates to no headlights and another service appointment. After 1 visit to the dealer each month for 3 years, I went out and bought a Volvo V50.   best car I have ever owned This is the most comfortable car, and I love going on long trips, in the rain or snow.. I have had 2 back surgeries and for once I can drive in comfort. Amazing seats. A blast to drive and at 40k not a single problem. Great service free oil changes etc by dealor were always a positive experience. Would definitly buy Audi again, but I dont want to part with this car. !! Great car! I have owned my Avant for 16 months \\rand love it as much now as the day I \\rbought it. It is a pleasure to drive, \\rthe most comfortable vehicle I have \\rowned, and dependable.  Although I am \\rpushing 60 years of age now, I enjoy  \\rthe power and sports-like handling  \\rthis car provides.  There is nothing \\rlike the way it makes you feel when \\ryou get it out on some country roads \\rand put it through its paces! Love My Avant 3.0! I have had this car for about 2 years\\rnow and I still relish the chance to\\rdrive it every time I get into it.  The\\rAvant is very practical and the added\\rcargo room has helped immensely with the\\roccasional trek to the neighborhood mega\\rhardware store.  So many extra design\\rdetails: drawers under seats, first-aid\\rkit, cockpit lighting to aid driver...so\\rmuch to mention.  Reliability has been\\rvery good.  Better than the Toyotas that\\rmy parents have bought.  Don\\'t believe\\rthe CR reports.  They are lies and\\rstrongly biased towards Japanese cars. \\rCheck this out:\\rhttp://www.allpar.com/cr.html Outstanding Machine I have owned Audis for 7 years now and \\rthis car is definately one of my \\rfavorites. Beautiful design, \\rperformance, and buid quality. This car \\ris one of the reasons why I will never \\rbuy anything but an Audi. There is no \\rbetter car in the sport wagon segment. German Delight I\\'ve owned this car for about 9 months \\rnow and it has been a real pleasure to \\rdrive. The handling is superb and the \\rpower is adequate. The interior is \\rexquisite and luxurious. We\\'ve had no \\rproblems in 5500 miles except for a \\rbad seat memory module. Gas mileage is \\rimproving as I am still in the break-\\rin period. Overall, I\\'ve had a \\rfantastic experience with this car. Great Value This is an excellent vehicle for the  Don\\'t call it a wagon An absolutely wonderful machine, and a \\rwonderful buy. The avant is a perfect \\rbalance of sportiness, luxury, utility, \\rsafety, and fuel economy for the job. Great Stuff! My car is 9 months old and I have driven it \\racross Canada and then to Boston.  First gear \\rhas been a little stiff, but at 12,000 miles it \\rhas finally broke-in.  The car is fantastic.  The \\r3.0L engine I think is essential since the car is \\rquite heavy.  I test drove the 1.8L Tubo engine \\rbut found that it hesitates when you step on \\rthe gas which can be a little scary when you \\rwant the power to get out of a problem.  Gas \\rmilage is great in the 3.0L...much \\rlike a four cylander.  I highly reccomend this \\rcar.       Nirvana As I\\'m in my 50\\'s now, I\\'ve driven \\rmany different types of vehicles but \\rmostly Japanese, including Lexus.  The \\rride of this vehicle supersedes by far \\ranything I have owned or tested in \\rperformance, comfort, handling, and \\rconfidence.  As I explained to a \\rfriend, this car could die on me \\rtomorrow, and I wouldn\\'t care because \\rthe time spent with it already has \\rprovided enough pleasure for a \\rlifetime.  Buy it, you won\\'t regret it. Better than BMW This is by far the most beautifully\\rdesigned stationwagon on the market. I\\rlooked at Saab (too expensive), Volvo\\r(no performance features), BMW (the\\r3-series is to small and the 5-series is\\rover-priced), and the Ford Focus (well\\r...). The A4 Avant is a good value for\\r$30,000, it will serve our family well\\rand at the same time be fun and exciting\\rto drive in the years ahead Best Value in it\\'s class. I got this one after a 01 BMW 325CI \\r5spd.  Performance is better than \\rexpected.  The handling is great, \\rbetter than my BMW.  Seat has more \\radjustments but slightly less \\rcomfortable.  Initial quality is \\rsuperb.  Car is tight and very solid.  \\rCup holders have been improved.  More \\rfeatures than BMW and a better value, \\rlooks better to(4 Door). looks,quality,surefooted, but no go! When we got the A4 avant for my wife a \\ryear ago,we knew the car was a \\rbeauty,and we suspected great built \\rquality,and we got it.\\rWhat we did not know is that the \\r1.8turbo matched to the 5 speed auto \\ris almost slow,noisy at high rpms,and \\rvery thirsty for so few inches.\\rWhy offer this combo to such \\runsuspecting public?I know the torque \\ris  excellent and that there is almost \\rno turbo lag,but pleeeeaaase, at 37 \\rgrands out the door,we deserve better \\rperformance!.\\rApart from that,it is very \\rcomfortable,handles beautifully, and a \\rvery pleasant place to spend time \\rin ,unless you are going up a \\rslope,fully loaded,with the dog in the \\rback.\\r  Not perfect but pretty good After about 1500 mi of mixed driving I\\rfind that I am still getting acclimated\\rto this car.  I special ordered to avoid\\rthe sunroof and had to wait 4 months for\\rthe car.  Fit and finish are first rate,\\rhandling is excellent, gas mileage is\\rabout what I expected, which is to say\\rmediocre so far.  My two significant\\rcomplaints center on the radio which has\\rabsolutely horrible AM reception, and\\rthe back end which doesn\\'t fit my golf\\rclubs(my bad for not checking).  All round performer , with cargo space Owning this car has been a thrill! Been \\rable to move everything from furniture \\rto friends in a sports like fashion.  \\rOwned a Focus wagon before as the work \\rcar, for home improvements an regular \\rwork because of supposed gas milage.  \\rWHAT A JOKE! Never better than 18 \\rcity/27highway now I get with a true \\rvechile 22city/30highway with the \\radvantages of safety, fun and \\rreliablity. An 800-Mile Impression (now that\\'s new) The fit and finish of this vehicle is \\ramazing.  If you want to know what I \\rmean, check out the door jams between \\rthe Audi A4 Avant and the Volvo V40 the \\rnext time you are at a car show.  The \\rpaint is perfect.  We already have one \\rtiny nick and can see the undercoating -\\r no bare metal.  So the metal is very \\rwell protected. More Cruiserweight than Comfort Cruiser We chose the A4 Avant because we needed \\rmore space than a compact sports sedan, \\rbut didn\\'t want to drive a brick-like \\rSUV.  Boy has the Audi delivered.  It \\ris a joy to drive, with smooth \\raccelration and endless road-holding.  \\rIn addition to holding the asphalt, the \\rcar holds more cargo in the boot than \\ryou could ever imagine for a car of its \\rsize.  The interior is quiet, and every \\rcontrol is easy to use and within a \\rfinger\\'s reach.  Everything about the \\rcar feels rock solid.  Audi engineers \\rhave thought of everything, the result \\ris the car contnues to reward hard \\rdriving and daily commuting. Very, Very Solid solid car!  I\\'ve driven it in \\rmany situations \\rsnow, rain, anything, and its always \\runflappable. The 4 has enough power, \\rand while it may lack some of the \\rgrunt of the v6, it is cheaper, gets \\rbetter gas mileage, and has plenty of \\rpower in pretty much any circumstance \\r(never had any problem merging).  \\rInside, the interior design is top-\\rnotch and one of the best I\\'ve seen, \\rvery well organized.  Everything is \\rvery intuitive.  I\\'d strongly \\rrecommend this to anyone who is lookin \\rfor brisk (but not boy-racer) \\rtransport in any conditions with room \\rfor 4 adults and a dog/a lot of their \\rstuff.  GETQUATTRO, IF IT WORKS ITS \\rMAGIC ONCE, YOU\\'VE PAID FOR IT Love my wagon My BMW X5 had constant niggling breakdowns. The A4: otally reliable. Fantastic acceleration. The car will go as fast as you can stand to drive it, in any weather, although with a little less grace (but more traction) than my ex-328i BMW. Wonderful and highly adjustable seats. Not roomy in back, but great for post-kids. Very well built (no defects, and I haven\\'t seen my dealership since purchase!) Gas mileage, which was mediocre at first, has improved over 7K miles to what Audi says on sticker. Climate control needs to be futzed with to stay comfortable in changing outside conditions. Awesome brakes! Overall experience: fantastic with just very minor quibbles. Just Don\\'t Call it a \"Wagon\" This is a fabulous car. Audi really \\rraised the bar with their latest \\rversion of the A4 . First of all, it is \\rone if the best looking mass-produced \\rvehicles going. (Why would anyone buy \\rthe A6? There\\'s not THAT much more \\rroom.)Its design elements are in \\rperfect balance - inside & out. The \\rsport suspension works great (its \\rhunkered-down stance looks fabulous \\rtoo). Very, very nice car. Get one. Love our 3.0 A4 Avant This is a great car. We love it, but\\rhated the Pirelli P6 tires that came\\rwith it. They were allergic to gravel\\rroads. The Bridgestone replacements are\\rdoing great. Quietly sensational This car is a joy to look at and drive. \\rWinter in Upstate NY has been brutal \\rthis year and I was concerned that the \\r17\" all-season tires would be an issue. \\rNot so. I bought tiptronic as other \\rfamily members can\\'t drive stick but \\rTiptronic really is a great compromise, \\rI use it all the time, slick fast and \\refficient changes. Can\\'t wait for \\rspring / summer to wash the salt off, \\rget wax on, and get the sunroof open. A4 avant One of the best handling cars EVER!  A4 avant One of the best handling cars EVER!  Love My A4  My Audi is my baby. I love driving it.  Great Car The new Audi 2003 Avant A4 is a great \\rcar, but the turbo lag is very \\rnoticible, far more than I anticipated. \\rNow, if you want an all-wheel drive \\rcar, then I can think of no better car \\rto get if you apreciate a sporty ride, \\rand great build quality.  I had the \\rSubaru Oakback LL Bean edition, and \\rwhile the Audi is $3000 more, and just \\ras fast, all the other features of the \\rAudi make it worth while. I love the \\rbody style, Bose Stero is awsome, \\rhandles great, build quality is \\rexcellent, lots of storage, and not bad \\rgas milage for a turbo engine.  I love \\rthe car, but the turbo lag is a serious \\rissue to consider. Exceeds my expectations ! I have found few negatives in the 1.8T \\rAvant.  It has great room, yet it is \\ramazing for traction and handling. \\rMileage has also exceeded the stated \\rEPA numbers. \\r There are no quality or workmanship \\rconcerns.  It\\'s leather interior is \\rfirst class and so far it is without \\rrattles or squeaks.  \\r The 1.8T engine is surprisingly smooth \\rand quick.  It has a distinct \\rengine/exhaust noise that enhances \\rit\\'s \"sports sedan\" classification. A4 Avant More hp would be great, waiting list \\rtoo long... Not a Soccer Mom Car Having no children, not wanting a mini-\\rvan or an SUV, but needing the space I \\rdecided on the A4 Avant 3.0.  The car \\rdoesn\\'t look like a station wagon, I \\rget compliments from everyone, it \\rrides great in the rain and over wet \\rleaves, it feels like a bigger car, \\rfun to drive, couldn\\'t ask for more.... Great Car but Terrible Gas Mileage This 2002 Audi Avant Automatic with an \\raverage of 17mpg. I can do straight \\rhighway and still only get 20mpg. Now \\rthe sticker says I should be getting 19 \\rcity and 28 Highway. But that is a bold-\\rface lie.\\rNO!, I wish Audi would post an accurate \\rMPG on the sticker so buyers would be \\raware of what cost they are getting \\rinto. Another feature i don\\'t like is \\rthe oil changes at 10,000 mile \\rintervals. The dealer does not know if \\rI have motor oil or synthetic? Services \\rare supposed to be free for 4yr or \\r50,000 miles. mmm\\rI used to change my oil every 3000 \\rmiles. A4 Sedan  My dad bought me this car.  It has all \\rthe safety features, luxury amenities, \\rand performance I expect from a German \\rcar. Quattro A4 Its really nice to know that my car  Quattro A4 Wonderful performance all-around.   I  Audi A4 I brought the car out to pick up my co-\\rworkers the other day, they were \\rimpressed.  One guy had an IS 300 and \\rthe other guy has an M5.  Both thought \\rthat the car had a good balance of \\rsportiness, luxury, and value. Audi A4 Aluminum trim is my favorite.  The car  2002 A4 1.8T Review The 2002 A4 1.8T avant is our 3rd Audi \\rsince 1999 and first wagon. It has \\rsurpassed expectations. Functionality \\rincludes under-seat and side pocket \\rstorage, and a second cargo floor \\runder the main floor; plus many hooks, \\rnets, and pockets. The f/r power \\routlets are extremely well placed. \\rThere is even a built-in retractable \\rcargo partition. Even the glove box \\rhas shelves! Ours has the sport \\rpackage, heated f/r seats, convenience \\rpackage w/moonroof, as well as cloth \\rseats, which wear well and heat faster \\rthan leather. We also HIGHLY recommend \\rthe xenon lights. The feel of the \\rheadlight switch and radio knobs are \\rwell worth the price of admission. Love it! Superb handling, and incredibly sure-\\rfooted thanks to quattro AWD.  \\rSuspension offers a great balance \\rcompromise between comfort and \\rhandling.  3.0 engine is smooth and \\rpowerful.  Interior is stunning.  All \\rin all, a joy to drive. Audi A4 has a serious enginer problem Engine coils failed one by one on my  Oil guzzler, unreliable heater, fatal timing belt Some things to look out for if you\\'re looking for a used 2003 audi A4: Audis are known for guzzling oil and this car is no exception. If you are buying a used car you may need to flush out the heater core. It has a flaw where it will accumulate gunk over the years and the heat will not work until it is flushed. Also ask about how recently the timing belt has been replaced. If yours snaps, the \"interference engine is toast. Engine dead at 58,000 I live in a city and rarely take road trips.  After ten months of ownership and replacing all ignition coils I went for one.  Two hours into the trip felt slight vibration that stayed the same for the rest of the trip.  An hour away from home on the return trip vibration started to worsen and became very bad right out of city limits.  Immediately to dealership where i was informed the crankshaft was warped.  New engine from Audi 13,000 with wait for it a 90 day warranty.  Local junkyard 2,000 for a used engine with two year warranty.  In the end I traded it for a Ford. A4 a Stylish Teenager This is a great looking and reliable car for a teenager living in the city.  It does not look like it has 93,000 for a car that is 14 years old.  Very roomy to take your friends around town, great storage for those overnight or weekend trips and what young person doesn\\'t want a luxury sedan for under $4000!?  It does lack today\\'s technology (no USB port- but I\\'ll throw in a USB charger; no Bluetooth or GPS- but smart phones work better anyway but it does have a great Bose sound system and a fun sunroof for those warm temps that are just around the corner.  Beige interior with a dark blue exterior, both in great condition.  The first four years of ownership was very little driving and kept in a heated car garage out in the suburbs.  The past 10 years has been mostly city driving, parked in a covered garage with occasional road trips to Iowa and Wisconsin to see family and friends. Never went one day without problems Bought my 2003 A4 with 95k miles on it.It had already had the timing belt replaced.The dipstick tube cracked and broke off when I attempted to check the oil.The coolant flange on the back of the engine poured coolant constantly, and the turbo leaked oil.Even after replacing the coil packs, fuel filter, and spark plugs the engine still had a rough idle.Ended up replacing every plastic check valve under the hood to no avail.Found that the crankcase vent tube cracked and broke off causing a vacuum leak.Went to get in the car one morning after rain, and the floor was 2 inches deep in water.Took forever to fix that issue.Too many issues to list.These things are LEMONS. Oil leak Problem As much fun to drive this car as, as much as the oil leakage does hurt your budget, so far I did spend close to 6000$ on this car in repairs, and yet the issue of oil leak was not fixed. and I was last called by the dealer to tell me, it needs an engine rebuild and this will cost me another 3000-4000 $ and they are not sure if it will solve the massive loss of oil ( more than a quarter of oil every 900 miles ) Still happy after 10 months I purchased in MI with 110k miles after my 14 yr old Mitsubishi Eclipse wasn\\'t worth fixing anymore. With regards to comfort and luxury, this was certainly a step up, growing up with only Japanese cars. Build quality, heaviness of German engineering is evident, but not without flaws. I had to put some money into the car considering its age. Maintenance/Repair: Timing belt-$800, rear coolant flange-$200, rear window regulator-$360, battery-$190. Otherwise, it\\'s a great car. Very comfortable, nice features, and a great drive. After an APR tune on the ECU, it has 235hp vs 170hp previously, which makes it fun and adequately powerful. It hasn\\'t had a huge effect on mileage, except for a heavy foot Sooo fun to drive, when it\\'s not broken I bought the car new over 7 years ago now. Should\\'ve known after 2 weeks when my AC compressor blew up that this was going to be a love/hate relationship. I\\'ve had it in the shop for: AC compressor, AC condenser, engine speed sensor, engine temp sensor, power steering pump, power steering rack, brake light switch, instrument panel malfunction, rear window regulator, and of course the common coil packs. And just now, the AC compressor blew AGAIN. And this is only off the top of my head.  It\\'s a shame because i LOVE driving the car, it handles like a dream, is great in the snow, but it\\'s just NOT reliable. Love my car, But I purchased this Audi A4 about 18 months ago, and i have loved it!  It\\'s a blast to drive, super comfortable, and amazing in snow!  But all this does come with its down sides.  About every month it seems like something else breaks on it, from the alarm horn, to the Ignition coils, to the gauge cluster, to the ignition read coil, to the water pump, and timing belt. These are fun cars, but they cost A LOT to maintain!  Be prepared! Audi A4 3.0 Quattro with Manual I have owned this vehicle since new. At 145K miles, engine gave out, with $6K repair needed to replace major engine components. Serviced regularly with oil change q 5K miles. Never driven hard, still has original clutch. However, both catalytic converters had to be replaced at 82K and 110k miles. Multiple parts inside needed replacing as well. When Audi USA was contacted over the engine problem, they blew me off (which I would understand if this engine defect were unique to my car, but it isn\\'t!) I would highly recommend that anyone buying A4s with 1.8 or 3 L engines carefully read other similar events on the internet before buying a used Audi. Don\\'t make a big mistake. Money Burner If you are getting a warranty than it\\'s a nice car, but without a warranty you may be getting into something you can not afford in the long run.  My car has the infamous sludge build up and my engine is now seized. Either pay 6,000 to replace it or get into an upside down loan for another 5 years.With that being said minus the sludge and the bad engine I did have some good time in this car.  Pretty, but not worth it I bought this car used with 50,000 miles. I loved it for the first couple of months, until things started going wrong. I had to replace all the ignition coils, fuel pump, check valves, broken moonroof, broken window regulator, broken cupholder. Oh yea, and just a few months ago there was a fire, cost over $5000 worth of damage under the hood, thank goodness insurance covered it. They said either an ignition coil or the wiring harness had a malfunction. When my coolant tank cracked and wouldn\\'t hold coolant, I decided it was time to trade it in. I loved the car, but I cant afford to keep fixing it and I don\\'t want to be worried all the time about something breaking or catching on fire.  Another Lemon Review This car is a total lemon.  Had to replace the motor and turbo (Audi eventually paid for it after a threatened law suit), electrical system, CVT, multiple headlights and break lights while being told this can be due to \"normal\" wear and tear. Check engine light is now on for the third time (motor is only one year old) and I have spent  $1500 thus far and the problem still isn\\'t resolved.  They also replaced my front tires twice before they figured out I had unusual wear because of a front end alignment problem. Great car, but reliability issues I bought this car certified used with 43k miles on it. I have driven Lexus, Acura, Infiniti, BMW and Mercedes. In general this is a great and solid feeling car. Outstanding interior which I like even better than the new models.  Strong performance (acceleration a little light), and fabulous in the snow. Great car when things are working.  Some reliability issues. Car got stuck in tiptronic day 1. Received flats on 3 of 4 pirelli tires that came with. Antenna had to be fixed, wipers got stuck vertical on windshield, had to replace brakes, fix broken wiper fluid tube, and engine steamed up once.  I have never felt that the car would stop running on me, but things always need to be fixed.   Beware!  Buy an Audi at your own risk! As I drove off the lot, the Xenon headlight leveling sensor warning light went on. I had to leave it overnight the first night I owned it! This was a problem that had to be fixed three times in the first year I owned it. My remote trunk release works only sporadically and I\\'ve had to fix it three times so far...this number would be higher if I hadn\\'t given up on fixing this problem. I\\'ve had problems with the power window switches, power mirrors, and the memory power seats. At 3 years, the rubberized trim around the cabin began to flake off. Though no major engine disasters (so far), I\\'ve had many other problems requiring time in the shop! 2003 A4 Quattro 3.0L I\\'ve owned the car since new and now have 125,000 miles on it. Fuel pump was replaced under recall and everything else has been just routine service. No problems whatsoever. Gas mileage averages about 25 - 26 on the highway. Quattro is great in all weather conditions. Comfortable interior, excellent stereo, Xenon headlamps make night driving easy. This has been an excellent car. Awesome Car! My A4 has 170,000 miles and is still running beautifully. It is fun to drive, comfortable, and not half bad looking either. Has run flawless its whole life (It has been maintained exactly when suggested by Audi). Will replace the timing belt again soon, though the manual says every 100 or 105k from what I have read it should be replaced every 60- 80k as that is when it is said to break. Build quality is in a whole different class, the car is amazingly sound and solid. Manual shifts smooth and precise. Gas mileage is anywhere from 23-24 city to 30-31 hwy. Quattro is awesome too!!! Save your money for repairs I have owned this car for 5 years and purchased it new.  I love the handling, performance,and smooth,quiet ride. It handles well in the snow.  As soon as the vehicle was off warranty and still under 50,000 miles, I had to replace the power steering pump, cracked vacuum tubes, and oxygen sensors. I calculated that it has cost me $100 per month for repairs since the warranty expired.  Not exactly the fine engineering and reliability I expected when I purchased the car. I read a lot of owner reviews that are experiencing the same failures my car has. I still love to drive this car, but I won\\'t be buying another Audi.  All Season Driving At 76,000 miles, I am very happy with this car.  The interior design is very ergonomic and everything is oriented to the driver.  Trunk space is huge.  The exterior design is simple, yet elegant.  Quattro AWD makes the car suitable for any driving conditions and the car is more than capable of performing in the corners - it just stays controlled at all times.  The 1.8T engine is a little under performing considering the brute weight of the vehicle, but an ECU upgrade quickly fixes that issue.  What you lose in engine performance, you gain in fuel economy where I get an average in the low 30\\'s on the highway - approximately 27 mpg over all. Original and stock clutch is still going strong. A Very Pretty Lemon This is the prettiest lemon I have ever owned!  Not worth the cost of the tires.  It is very unreliable.  I purchased this car for my daughter last year, a college student, and she has been stranded so many times that AAA canceled our contract after only 4 months! First the CVT went out, then it\\'s been in the shop for numerous sensor replacements. Headlight replacements, $300 a pop.  Just required to have the timing belt replaced at only 80K on Friday ($1500), Saturday a.m. my daughter called and said the check engine light came back on. Love my car.....but....things to know I love my audi and will say that it drives the same as the day I bought it (with 8800 miles on it).  With that said, repairs are expensive so you should know that.  Find a good VW or Audi mechanic and don\\'t use your dealership as they are a rip off.  Here are some things I have paid for on my car with 86K miles on it.  At 43K a new clutch....70K a new timing belt, spark plugs, and water pump, front breaks at 72K and rear breaks at $77K.....82K catalytic converter, 85K miles suspension arms, etc.  In the last year I have put $5,000 in my audi and plan to keep it for another 80K miles.  My mechanic has been great and lesson learned is after the warranty was up I should have found a mechanic.   Beware the 2003 Audi A4 4WD I purchased 2 2003 Audi A4\\'s at the same time. Just as the warranty expired, similar defects appeared in both cars.  In just over two years, almost everything has gone wrong with both cars. They are both lemons. The Audi dealership we went to charged me almost $3K for 2 visits in which they couldn\\'t diagnose the problem. The turbo exploded 2 weeks ago in one of them and damaged the engine in the process. Both cars are a money pit, and I am attempted to dump both & absorb the loss. Audi corporate apologized for my frustration & loss & asked if there was anything else they could do today. DON\\'T BUY THESE CARS!!!! Just OK! I have had my Audi for 2 years and it has been to the dealership for multiple problems 4 times and it needs to go back again. From interior peeling to ignition coils, it really has been one thing after another, mostly little things though. I hate the fact that the 2nd cup holder is in the center console, pretty useless!  However, I have to say that I really love this car. It is a smooth ride and it can virtually get through snow and ice with very little slipping if any at all. The Bose stereo puts out great sound. It handles corners great. Could have a little more power, but its not bad. Will get another A4 but it will definitely be the newer 2009 model. Hopefully they\\'ll get it right in 2009. Love the car, but it\\'s a heartbreaker! I love to drive my A4, which makes it only more painful that it\\'s been in the shop more times than I\\'d care to count. It\\'s peppy, smooth, and easy to handle on the highway. It\\'s beautiful inside when everything\\'s working. But, it\\'s had more broken electrical parts than I knew existed on a car, and every repair is crazy expensive. I wonder if they fly the parts one by one from Germany! Like others, have had multiple issues with the stereo, sunroof, various lights/indicators, relays, in addition to the dead fuel pump. Tires pop like balloons, and they\\'re expensive, too. An expensive love, for sure. Good car with some extra cost Wow, I will probably buy another Audi, but I will do so more informed. The car is a thrill to drive and relatively good on the gas with out a lead foot. That said it takes premium fuel to push this wagon. Don\\'t believe you can sub 87 octain every now and then, it will foul the spark plugs. If you are a DITYer be careful driving this car on to a hydraulic lift, the sport suspension does not allow enough clearance to prevent high centering. I bought this car used in Oct \\'06 for about 16.5K two years later it is at least as valuble as what I still owe.  Solid performer with great intentions The car is reliable, it breaks but rarely is it anything that you can\\'t get home on. I grenaded the clutch 2 months after I got it (the clutch was shot when I bought it) and sawed through the transmission case, but she still got me home! It is a fast car, and there are many modifications out there!  Love/Hate Hate This is truly a driver\\x92s car, both interior and exterior finish had a classy sturdy feel. Economy and performance were great, 25/city and highway up to 33 long range trips. Now for the nightmare, the list that went wrong was excessive, items that normally should have no problems for 10 years/100,000 miles started to fail within two week of ownership. Although the warranty/dealer took care of everything while in warranty, afterwards it got out of control.  Audi could care less other than to close my filed complaints as soon as possible.  Own it get rid of it after warranty, shelf life is short. Run Far, Far, Far Away It\\'s a great car when everything is working. Unfortunately, that is rare. Problems I\\'ve encountered in the approximately 35K miles I\\'ve owned the car: rear driver side power window fail - $400 rear pass. side power window fail - $400 (I live in mortal fear of operating the power windows now - I\\'m sure it\\'s only a matter of time before the front ones go) CV joint - $1200 bottomed out and punched a hole in oil pan (ok partly my fault) $800 check engine light - faulty \"crankshaft assistor\" $1250 bulbs are difficult to replace. Do not buy this car if not under warranty. You will regret it every day you own it   Giving up the Audi After owning the Audi for almost 5 yrs, I\\'m ready to give it up and move on to a more reliable and cheap to fix sedan (Honda or Toyota).  Although it has been fun to drive, i have had a few problems--the initial take-off is dangerous with it sliding and forcibly popping into gear without going anywhere, the air-conditioning never got cold enough (making it worse w/charcoal-colored interior), front air and radio buttons scratched off and needed replacing, frequent engine light indicators going off needing repairs (recent \\'oxygen sensor\\' & gas valve sensor repairs cost almost $1000).  It has been fun and sexy to drive though! My beloved mechanical trainwreck I love this car.  I also hate this car. Bought it with 43,000 miles on it, and 5k later had to replace the clutch (of course not under warranty).  Since then, traction control cpu has failed (dealership fails repeatedly to fix it), THREE ignition coils have failed (one on vacation)... the list goes on.  I cringe when the car so much as shudders now- it feels as though the thing\\'s just waiting for the worst possible moment to break.  Styling is great, fuel economy is decent, interior comfort and design is stellar. Turbo lag is ridiculous- the power delay is embarrassingly pronounced. The mechanical issues are too much.  This has soured my opinion of Audi- my next car will not be an Audi. Excellence  The car is amazing, the 5 speed is gear limited at 138 MPH, but it gets there fast with the 1.8T engine. Definitely worthy of a test drive, that\\'s all it takes. One good pull away from a red light and you\\'re hooked. If you\\'re in it for luxury, you are by no means left out, this car has more features than any of the new lincolns, cadillacs, or beemers I have sat in. If you\\'re in it for economy, I\\'m seeing an average of 26MPG mixed city and highway (about 60/40% respectively), so it\\'s not too shabby. BMW Killer From Day 1, this automobile has proven to me everything I ever knew about Audi as a whole. I am impressed with its quality, style, design, and attention to detail. It\\'s a resounding 10! Questionable Reliability Poor acceleration for a 3.0 V6. Fuel economy is abysmal for the level of performance. Electrical problems and fuel pump failures continue to plague this vehicle. Remote transmitters quit after 20K miles. Once the warranty expires be prepared to sink thousands into the vehicle. Look elsewhere for an entry level luxury sedan. 2003 Audi A4 1.8T CVT Compared to a reliability of a Honda Accord, I rate the reliability of this car to 8 out of 10, 10 being a Honda.  Problems I encountered include driver side window rolling down on its own due to sensitive anti-pinch protection (4 dealer trips to fix), moonroof moving on its own (switch keeps going bad), driver side speakers going in and out.  Good mileage (26 mpg), nice interior/exterior.  CVT has a slight delay, which is sometimes annoying.  Sound system is good even for a basic system (except for the speaker problem). Awesome, Awesome, Awesome Audi\\'s Quattro AWD is simply breathtaking.  Snow, ice or rain, this car cuts through it like butter.  In fact, we used it instead of our Ford Explorer in the snow, ice and rain last winter.  It\\'s also easily the best handling car I\\'ve ever owned!  German engineering at its best!  The red lights illuminate the dashboard at night, incluing two red LEDs that project downward from the ceiling, creating a cockpit-like environment.  I am now a dedicated Audi driver forever, never follow! Good buy If it weren\\'t for the annoying electrical problems (3 headlight and 2 turn signal burnouts) I\\'d rate the reliability excellent.  The A4 is fun to drive, has decent gas mileage and the quality of build is excellent.  It handles wonderfully and even with the small engine, it has plenty of zip in all situations.  I love the surefooted AWD especially in our Montana winters.  I\\'ll definitely buy Audi again. Poor CVT Reliability The problem is that the CVT transmission is a sealed, closed design and can\\'t be rebuilt or fixed. A replacement transmission costs about $8000 installed.  Not worth keeping out of warranty. Fun car! But very expensive to fix! First A4, owned 2.5 years now. Very fun to drive, Quattro makes it handle like a dream. Very good in slippery weather. 60K regular service cost $700 at Audi dealer.  3 months later car needed all 4 brakes to pass state inspection $950! rotors must be replaced at each brake job (every 30K to 40K depending on how you drive). 2 months after brake job Bose stereo quit working. Not covered under CPO extended warranty $1700. Very expensive to own after original 50K warranty expires! Disappointing Audi My 03 A4 1.8T Quattro (53K miles) is constantly in the shop.  The dealership once forgot to change the oil during scheduled maintenance, forcing a breakdown on 95.  Another time, the oil pump failed, again forcing a breakdown on 95.  Further, separate fuel coils have failed, forcing two additional breakdowns on the highway.  Aside from reliability, the A4 1.8T Quattro is a sluggish car (although it handles nicely in bad weather).  I previously owned an A4 and had similar issues.  While this car looks good inside and out, its reliability is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly.  I will never buy an Audi again, and I urge you to exercise caution before purchasing one. Quick, powerful and fun! This car is a dream! Four years and it has never been in the shop for anything but a service. It\\'s fast, it\\'s fun, it has a great gear box and great heated seats in the winter. The 4WD takes it over mounds of snow without a wimper. The only thing wrong with it is that it only gets 20 MPG in combined driving and takes premium gasoline.  Audi Quattro 1.8 I purchased my Audi brand new and had to replace the fuel pump twice. Once at 28,000 miles (under warranty) and just recently at 57,000 miles (out of warranty, a $500 repair). Other than that the car has been very reliable and fun to drive. With the Quattro all wheel drive it is very easy to get around in the snow.  Great used luxury sport vehicle We were looking for a sports sedan but not neccessarily the Audi, but when we saw the car it immediately caught our attention.  We really liked the exterior line and the interior finishes.  After the test drive we were hooked, but concerned about the reliablity of the Audi brand.  Our fears were relieved when we researched the car.  After a second test drive we bought the car and have no regrets.  The car handles extremely well on the back roads.  We have had no troubles with the car which is approaching 67,000 miles.  Our only beef is the car feels cramped when our two elementary age kids are with us.  The car performed and handle extremely well on a recent mtn. trip. Not too bad I\\'ve had this car for over 3 years now. Had to get the windshield replaced in the first week: it had a defect that made everything look \"wobbly.\" The fuel pump gave out at 1.5 years/30K miles, stranding me at 5 am (very frustrating!). I have since witnessed about 4 other identical models stranded in parking lots or on the freeway. Since the fuel pump, the car has not given me any problems, aside from strange electrical issues such as the mirrors rotating out of memorized position. Great car Bought it brand new 3.5 yrs ago and had only 2 problems. Oil sludge build up at 43K miles which the dealer fixed right away. Fuel pump went out at 57K, warranty had already expired at 50K, but dealer replaced w/50% off.  Other than that, its been a great reliable car.  Would purchase another Audi in a heartbeat. Excellent A4 Love the 2003 1.8T A4 Quattro.  No problems, squeaks or rattles so far.  Handles like the car is on rails.  Very smooth although the turbo lag takes a bit to get used to.  Averaging 27 mpg. Excellent I used to have BMW, I found AUDI more economical and they paid close attention to detail in exterior and especially interior. The engine, fuel consumption and performance is excellent. Smooth ride and thrill when turbo kicks-in. Interior electronics and design is superior quality and standards are much more than any other luxury car has. Audi Quattro The vehicle has not given me any problems whatsoever. It starts up immediately and runs like a champ. Fun to drive as well. Huge mistake My first mistake was to start the car.  Now I know German cars need care, but this car was at the dealer for 150 days (45 in a row) for all sorts of issues.  Audi USA sent me to 4 dealers before they sent someone for Germany to take a look, they kept saying I am having a unique experience - guess I am blessed.  The team from Germany spent 2 weeks rebuilding it, however, that did not stop the electrical issues.  Audi USA now says I can go anywhere I like.  Audi does not stand behind the product.  If they just took the time to offer a customer service experience I\\'d might take another chance. Happy in Hampstead This is one solid car!  The handling and responsiveness are unmatched.  The stock 1.8T is a little lacking in the power category but that was solved with $300 and a chip upgrade performed by my local performance shop.  I obviously bought used but have since put on 18,000 miles with no problems.  My only gripe is with the electrical system as I have replaced at least 5 bulbs in the past 9 months.  But they are DIY and don\\'t cost much so worth the performance, handling, and style of this pure performance machine.  BMWho?  This won\\'t be my last Audi. Mid Life Crisis I drive frequently back and forth to a remote office, a four hundred round mile trip. 100 miles is secondary, the rest is highway. I have enjoyed the car immensely. I am 6-1 and have plenty of legroom. The manual transmission is silky smooth and the handling superb. I have averaged 22 mpg over 52k miles with 93 octane. I enjoy the manual shift acceleration. I am sure I could squeak out a couple of more mpg if I took it a little easier. I put snow tires on and have had no problems traveling in a few pretty good snow storms. Only mechanical problem was a bad A/C compressor at 20k. Definitely the funnest car I have owned.    Lemon This was my 1st (and last) Audi after many VW\\'s. I\\'ve had nothing but troubles. Numerous electrical problems (too many to list) the dealership either can\\'t or won\\'t fix. Interior is cramped. I\\'m 6\\' tall and 200lbs and have to wedge myself in and out of the car. Driver\\'s side leg room is very bad. Center console digs into my right knee. Cup holder and glove box are totally useless. Interior knobs and parts have broken, melted, and fallen off. Exterior parts fall off. Tires wear unevenly and one is bald after only 30k mi. The dealership laughs at all the problems I report every time I bring the car in for service. Luckily it\\'s a lease and I will be happy to pay the aquisition fee to give it back. Disappointing After great initial enthusiasm for this car I have become very disillusioned.  I have had ignition coils replaced twice (once stranding me 400 miles from home), more flat tires than ever in my life, squeeks and rattles, seatbelts that get wet when it rains, on and on.  I love this car, but I can\\'t afford to keep it now that the warranty has expired.  It\\'s cost me $2000 in the last two months in repairs.  It\\'s great to drive, but too unpredictable to enjoy all of it\\'s wonderful features. Great car but purchase with caution After owning my A4 for 2 yrs now, I am satisfied but at the same time disappointed.  I\\'ve had my fuel pump burn out at 29000 miles and at about 38000 miles, the water pump slowly leaked into the timing belt and its components. This made the timing chain snap and one of the pistons slapped 2 of the valves... bottom line, my car was at the dealer for 2 weeks.  Had it not been under warranty, $5000 in damages.   Beautiful car not worth your time This is one georgeous car. When it runs, it\\'s great. But as the miles add up, flaws start to add up one after another. At 50000 miles, I was told there was an oil leak (no visible drips under the car). The warranty fixed it. Then, my FM radio reception died unless I was within 15 miles of the station (previously the reception was MUCH better). Just prior to the 60000 mile service, the engine quit. Thought it was electrical. It was actually a broken cam shaft! All freeway driving, I baby this thing. Average 36 MPG. How can I break a cam shaft? Dealer says everything looks fine, not abused. Poor manufacturing in my opinion. Looking at a $4000+ bill to get it fixed. Not my idea of reliability. Surpassed Expectation Looking to move into a lightly used German sports sedan, one drive and the decision was over.  Much tighter steering and responsiveness than the others I looked at.  Even though it only has a 4 cyl, the turbo more than makes up the difference, but no nagging lag problems.  Build quality was unreal and the car is easy to add-on aftermarket engine and body mods.  I\\'m sold and this won\\'t be my last Audi. Warranty Work My A4 has been a wonderful car, but the Audi dealerships I have contacted in my area will not do warranty or regular maintenance work on my car unless I sign an agreement to binding arbitration. I refused to sign away my right, and I was refused service. Customer Relations at Audi of America said they couldn\\'t do anything about it. The consumer is not made aware of this \"condition\" until after they bought their car. Also- The only place a person can buy windshield wipers is at the Audi dealership for 50 dollars a pair. Ask before you buy! Fun to drive but expensive to own My 2003 A4 has 53,000 miles on it. I bought the car for about $32,000 and have spent over $12,000 on repairs. The car is poorly built and unreliable. It is very difficult to work with Audi of America and the local dealers are terrible. Before buying one of these cars I would strongly recommend talking to someone who has owned one and checking out the service of the dealers where you live and the estimated service costs. My car has had several major problems in the 2 1/2 years that I have owned it and neither the dealer nor Audi or America seems to care. Audi 1.8T Experience Purchased 2003 A4 1.8T last month. The turbo lag is very noticeable. Almost had an accident because the Audi hesitated while accelerating from a stop sign. The gears grind when shifted into \\'Drive\\' in the morning. Car has 29,000 miles. Glad I got a CPO vehicle, certified up to 100K miles or 2009. I knew not to expect a flawless vehicle from Audi. I do love the handling and looks of the car. Blk on Blk looks great, with 17 inch wheels. I get a lot of compliments, as I\\'m the only A4 owner in town. If you can spare extra $3K, buy the 3.0. I wish I had. Most fun car a corner has ever seen!! My AUDI has changed the way I view other vehicles. I\\'ve had many vehicles, I\\'ve also worked in a number of collision centers, so I\\'ve been in and test driven many different vehicles. The A4 is easy to drive, the cock-pit controls are easy to understand and operate, and the steering feels as if it\\'s extensions of your hands holding to the road. Power is precise with a large torque power-band, less down-shifting and more go pedal. The car feels firmly planted in all aspects of driving, cruising down the highway to ripping around a high-way on-ramp. I\\'ve personally put other high-end car drivers to shame with my A4 1.8T quattro, most of which had I6\\'s or V6\\'s. I\\'m always leading, never following! A Great Car -- Under Warranty The handling, performance, fit and finish are all excellent.  The fuel economy is better (avg. 31 mpg) than expected.  The dealer\\'s warranty service has been outstanding, which is a good thing.  In 45,000 miles I have replaced one front loudspeaker, ignition coils (a recall item), windshield washer pump, sun roof switch, front cam shaft oil seal, and head cover seals.  All this was warranty work, but if it hadn\\'t been, it would have been a couple of thousand dollars on items that shouild last the life of the car.  Given its record, I am not sure that I will keep it after the 50,000 mile warranty expires, or buy another one. Shocked Looked at C-Series, 5 Series and the Audi A4.  Shocked that I had never given Audi a chance before.  Hands down, much better car over.  Handles like it\\'s on rails.  Great driving in the winding mountain roads.  Sold for life.  Without a doubt, one of the best all around cars that gives the most bang for the buck.  Test drive one and even the most cynical of you, will have to smile and yes, probably be shocked at how great it is as well.  Why I\\'ve Owned Seven There\\'s is little to criticize about the 2003 Audi A4 1.8T Sedan. The turbo kicks in and is much snappier than my A6 with a V6 engine was. As you look about the cabin you find extra after extra. Instead of thinking \"Why didn\\'t the designers do it this way\" you exclaim \"I\\'m glad they thought to provide that\". With over 12,000 miles the only repair that I needed to make on this car was a measley brake lamp. This took the dealer about ten minutes to fix. A4 3.0Q 6spd Man I wanted a sports sedan with AWD.  At the time, the G35x was still a few months away.  The 225hp BMW330xi decently optioned was $43,000+.  The BMW doesn\\'t have an in-dash 6CD, dual climate control or a compass - garage door opener could be installed \"after-market\" and it costs $43,000?  My 6spd 220hp A43.0Q stickered $39,000, but sold for a lot less.  I had one problem with headlight washers - nothing more.  I\\'m getting only about 20 mpg, which is pretty poor for this size car. My previous car, a \\'95 Nissab Maxima easily got near 25 mpg.  The interior is beautiful, except for the bizarre set-up with the armrest / brake, and the worst cupholder this side of Yugo.  The acceleration could be better, but I love the AWD.  The transmission pretty rubbery vs. BMW Fun to drive, when not in the shop... I recently purchased a 2003 Audi A4 3.0 because\\rthe BMW 330xi was the most comparable \\rcar, but was far more expensive and came with \\rless features.  Let me say that I LOVE \\rdriving my car and even miss it when I \\rtake the train into work or if I\\'m on \\rvacation, especially if I\\'m having to \\rdrive a poor rental car.  However, I\\'ve \\rhad it in the shop 3 times now, most \\rrecently to change the spark plugs!\\rApparently, if the car isn\\'t started \\rduring a drastic change in temperature, \\ras we often get in Chicago, then the \\rengine could misfire and have to be \\rserviced! This is what the dealer told \\rme and said that most newer luxury cars \\rare like this.  Still love the car, but \\rworried over the long haul for \\rreliability. First Audi, and Love It I bought this car used on a \"whim\" \\rwhile driving my reliable Toyota one \\rSaturday.  It\\'s fun to drive with the \\r17\" wheel sport package, and has more \\rthan enough power and handling for most \\rpeople.  The turbo has a low, metallic \\rgrowl when it\\'s cold, but it generally \\rperforms well.  Service is okay, \\ralthough I question the wisdom of \\rscheduled oil changes every 10k miles, \\rbut I can report no other problems \\rright now. Just a lot of fun to drive I have had this car for a little over \\ra year now. I drive it every day 40 \\rmiles into work and back.\\rI t fits like a glove (and I am 6\\'4\"), \\rhandles like a charm and the 4WD is a \\rlife saver.\\rBe careful though on an open stretch \\rof highway: before you know it you\\'re \\rgoing way too fast...\\rAs if this is not enough, I also like \\rthe free 4 year service plan. Great Design, Poor Reliability I want to love this car, but the \\rmanufacturing reliability is quite \\rpoor.  I\\'ve had numerous electrical \\rproblems, with the brake lights, \\rstereo, and fuel injection.  There is \\rannoying squeaking noise in the left \\rfront suspension.  The design and \\rergonomics of the car are outstanding, \\rbut I will never buy another Audi, \\rbecause I don\\'t trust the car will work \\rfor the long-haul and I don\\'t want to \\rhave to take into the service \\rdepartment on a monthly basis. I am glad that I bought this car This is my first Audi (after having a Jetta and a \\rTercel). Everything is amazing about this car. It is \\rstylish, elegant, fun to drive and makes me feel \\rsafe. Some BMW owners complimented on the \\rinterior stying and quality. The car could be a bit \\rquicker, but is actually fine for my taste. It does \\rwhat I would expect from a 1.8L engine. Quattro is \\ramazing, especially in the rain, the car feels very \\rstable at all times. I had some issues, but the \\rdealership has fixed them all at no charge and even \\rprovided a rental car (though a cheap one :-) ). I am \\rleasing this car, but will probably end up buying it \\rafter the four years, it is just an awsome vehicle to \\rown.  Fun to Drive, but Awful Service I spent a great deal of time \\rresearching BMW\\'s 330X, Mercedes C \\rClass, and others. In the end, I chose \\rAudi. My 2003 Audi 3.0 is a blast to \\rdrive. The car handles well and goes \\rlike gang-busters. The interior is well \\rdesigned and very comfortable. However, \\rin the past year and a half I have had \\rthe car in for repairs about a dozen \\rtimes. Problems include keys that \\rstopped working (3 times), replacement \\rAC compressor, ABS, Airbag and other \\rdash lights showing, drive train out of \\rbalance, key fobs that would not \\rlock/unlock the doors, etc. What\\'s \\rworse, I\\'ve had to take the car back to \\rhave DCH either re-do their work on \\rmultiple occasions. What a let down! This car is great I have 42,000 miles in less than 2 \\ryears and not a single problem.  It \\rstill handles and rides as well when \\rit was new.  It handles very well in \\rbad weather conditions.  The dealer \\rhas done all maintainence.  I have a \\rlong commute everyday to work, but \\rthis car makes that commute easily.  \\rThe interior and exterior design still \\rimpresses.I plan on keeping this car \\rfor as long as I can.  Recently I had \\rto drive a friends Lexus IS300 and \\rthat doesn\\'t even compare. The New Top Quality German Marque. I tested the same class vehicle of Mercedes and \\rBMW. The Audi, as I perceived it was best i class.\\rThe Mercedes was not even close in handling\\racceleration and overall sporty \\'feel\\'. The BMW was \\ra close second very; similar in handling & \\racceleration but the quality of \\'fit and finish\\' were \\rnot up to the Audi\\'s. I had to look trough many of \\rthe 300 series before finding one that was close.\\rSo overall in my opinion The audi has come a long \\rway in every aspect. The BMW has slipped a bit in\\rquality, still a fine car. The Mercedes was actually \\rdisappointing for such a costly entry level sedan.\\rThere you have it...One man\\'s opinion, three fine \\rcars. Great for those who really know Audi 2003 1.8T Quattro Red with all options. \\rInstalled KN Filter, new air intake and \\ra module for the turbo. Increased the \\rHP from 170 to near 210. The AWD is \\rgreat for snowy winters in Connecticut. \\rExcellent handling in the rain and \\rslippery conditions, tight ride - very \\rtight and rigid - good for German \\rlovers. Slight turbo lag, but overall \\rexcellent speed - plenty for \\racceleration and high speed passing on \\rthe turnpike. Brakes are as good as \\rthey get - at times I worry about \\rpeople behind me. Good stereo, \\rexcellent heating and A/C. Displays are \\rclean. Stereo: 6-CD Changer at your \\rreach - really happpy with it. Gas \\rmilage struggles past 20 in city. My 1.8T Quattro Great looking exterior. Interior is \\rfine, but 3 series is slightly more \\rluxurious. Love interior lights. Feels \\rlike cockpit of a jet fighter. \\rHandles great. Poor lowend torque. \\rLeather feels cheap. Bose stereo isn\\'t \\ranything spectacular. Love spacious \\rinterior compared to 3series. Lots of \\rleg room. Center console is a bit wide, \\rknee keeps rubbing against the side and \\rreally hurts. Driver seat \\runcomfortable. Average Audi service. \\rDon\\'t always take care of the issue and \\rloaner policy blows. I spend 30k and \\rwhen its serviced, I have to drive \\raround in a Ford Escort?! great car fun too drive the car drives well and handling is  Better than I could have imagined After looking at MB c240, BMW 330ci and \\rthe Audi 1.8t I finally bought a 2003 \\r3.0, Quattro, 6 spd and can I just tell \\reveryone, it\\'s probably the best car I \\rhave ever driven.\\r I mean, the BMW was nice... but not \\rworth the extra cash (plus the interior \\rof the Bimmer is bland). \\r The c240 was solid, but wasn\\'t much fun \\rto drive.  Moreover, the interior \\rlooked like someone just started \\rsticking stuff on the dash (very poor \\rlayout)\\r My suggestion is to take the plunge, \\rget the Audi, you won\\'t be disappointed \\r(but an Assured car might be a good \\ridea... just in case). Saftey Hazard Looks good, but am afraid to turn left \\rin front of oncoming traffic, feels \\rlike a Disney Autopia Car. Audi does it again! Audi really made some nice \\rimprovements in the 2002 and 2003 \\rmodel.  The ride is much nicer than \\rthe Lexus IS300 or the BMW 3Series.  \\rFor the money, the A4 takes the cake.  \\rThe looks are much more aggressive \\rthan any other car in its class.  My Audi Nice car and has all the extras, but \\rneeds more power.  The inside is \\rspectacular and looks so nice at night \\rwhen it is all lit up.  Bose stereo is \\rgood, but no like a Harmon Kardon or a \\rMark Levinson in a rivial sedan.  Fun \\rto drive, but just not as fun as my \\rold BMW.  My openion is, this car is \\rnice, has plenty of options and \\rextras, but if you can afford it buy a \\rBMW 3 series because it is a better \\rvehicle and funner to drive.  I \\rpromise! Quattro is good Audi Quattro provides excellent traction\\ron wet and snow covered roads. \\rBeautiful interior with high quality \\rmaterials. Car has been back to dealer \\rfour times for a rattle in the exhust, \\ronly appears on cold days. Also car has \\rdeveloped a problem in the ignition, \\rwarning alarm will not shut off when \\rcar is turned off and then car won\\'t \\rlock. a creature of comfort The 03\\' Audi A4 has been a blast to \\rdrive. One word-QUATTRO! I do not think \\rI will buy another car without AWD. \\rAudi design is impressive. Very nice \\rinteriors. Excellent paint finishes. \\rThe 3.0 has hussle, but may be less \\rimpressive at low torque.\\rCons: Brakes squeek, interior wind \\rnoise at higher speeds 70-80mph.\\rOverall awesome! Wish I had the S4!  Better than a Bimmer I\\'ve had (and loved)a 3 series BMW, \\rbut this car is even more fun to \\rdrive. The Quattro AWD gives the car a \\rfeeling of adhesion to the road that\\'s \\ramazing. Excellent Automobile This is a magnificent car in just about  A very reliable car in all conditions Feel so happy whenever I drive my A4. \\rHandling is incredible, and you can \\rcertainly feel the tight grip that \\rquattro gives you in all weather \\rconditions. Interior is stunning, with \\rall it\\'s features right at the place \\rwhere they should be. Also.. WOW, what \\ra look! \\r Nicely done by Audi. A4 3.0 Quattro Sport  An excellent car. 3 month/5000 mile \\rreview, had to wait for winter use \\rbefore reviewing.  I had a BMW 325xi \\rpicked out until I drove the A4.  Many \\rmore features, larger trunk, larger \\rmotor, better vehicle for $3800 less.  \\rSmooth, quiet, handles well on snow \\rpacked roads, will slide on ice like \\rall vehicles can.  MPG is same as \\rlisted on window sticker.  I suppose I \\rcould drive a little less aggressive \\rbut that won\\'t happen in this fun car. \\rA little slow off the line, but that \\rends quickly in the mid-range power \\rband.\\r A4 Review A4 is an unreliable auto. My vehicle \\rwas towed in 2 times in the first 6 \\rmonths for blown coils.\\rHeadlights needed to be changed 6 times \\rin the first year.\\rCar is currently out of service for a \\rblown oil pump, turbo and two cylinders.\\rAudi would not provide a rental car and \\rdid not attempt in any way to assist.\\rThere was to be a recall on A4\\'s for \\rtheir oil pump, but was cancelled. Great car... but I love this car.  Fit and finish is  Love the Car The car in my mind, is your best buy, \\rpound for pound. Who said, a car is a car?  I\\'ve had the 3.0 for about seven months \\rand really enjoy driving it whenever I \\rget the chance. I\\'m not overly \\rimpressed with the S4 this year as the \\rcost/performance ratio is not that \\rgreat. If your looking for a well built \\rgerman auto, with all the options far \\rbelow the cost of other brands in it\\'s \\rmarket segement. The 3.0 is worth the \\rmoney.  Fun car to drive This is one of the best cars that I  audi review great fun to drive, handles well, feels \\rsafe in all weather \\rconditions,performance is excellent,  \\rinterior is comfortable,  back seat leg \\rroom slightly small and trunk slightly \\rsmall. 2003 audi a4 quattro 1.8T This is the best car in its class for \\rthe money.  A comparably equipped BMW \\r325ix costs over $5000 more and doesn\\'t \\rlook nearly as good in sedan form. The \\rinterior is ergonomically perfect, with \\reverything right where it belongs,while \\rconveying a very upscale feel.The car \\rshould definately be ordered with the \\roptional sport package ($1000), which \\rincludes a sport suspension and 17\\'\\' \\rwheels.This does everything for the \\rappearance and handling.It\\'s very quick \\rand gets 32mpg on all trips taken.  The \\r1.8T is alot more fun to drive than the \\r3.0.This car is the perfect combination \\rof performance, luxury and economy for \\runder $30k. EXCELLENT I have driven my car over 26000 miles \\rin one year.  That\\'s the equivolent to \\r2 years\\' driving...nothing but a \\rpleasure.  On the longest drives (8 \\rhours total, non-stop, city/ hgwy) I\\'ve \\ralways remained comfortable.  During \\rrainy days and at night w/ my xenons, \\ralways safe.  No engine troubles, no \\rstalling, no electrical problems.  Fit \\r& finish are great, as well as all the \\rnon-gadgetty gadgets.  Although I would \\rprefer better gas mileage, the comfort \\r& prestige and head turning design make \\rit all worthwhile and gives a huge \\rlevel of satisfaction! 3.0 is MINT! A magnificent ride that starts to break- Totally Sweet!! This is a fun, fast vehicle.  I looked \\rat a BMW 330 and felt that the A4 was a \\rmuch superior vehicle.  Not only that, \\rbut it\\'s a better value! German Engineering Fun to drive and handles well. The car \\rdoes lack power, but is not that bad \\rwhen you use the sport mode though.  \\rThe interior is solid, very \\rcomfortable seats except for the 5th \\rperson who has to sit in the middle. This car has been a dream Bought this car in July 2003, it is now Sept \\r2003, and have 7,700 miles on it already.  Not \\ra single problem and it is a dream to drive on \\rhighways and back roads.  Recent heavy \\rdownpours were plowed through with nary a \\rwhimper.  The attention to detail is \\rremarkable. What a great design The driver\\'s experience is clearly what the engineers had in mind when designing this car.  The engine delivery and transmission shifts are silky smooth.  The turbo layout turns a usually puny 1.8 litre 4 banger into a fun and almost organic feeling torquey little animal!  Audi has designed the drivetrain well.  The interior and exterior both have the same concept in mind.  Clean and sexy lookin.  Some of my friends chuckle at me getting the wagon but I love it.  It\\'s just way to versitile to pass up.  I play hockey and have a Big German Shepherd.  I need the space.  The other day I had three big dogs in the back and they all had room to lie down and relax on our trip. Best Car I\\'ve Ever Owned This car rocks!  Handling, performance, utility, it has it all.  3.0 is much better than the 1.8 turbo with lag o\\'plenty.  The A4 Avant is stylish and very well built, and Audi as a company does it right.  Their maintenance program and professionals are top notch.  Car is very high tech.  They can program desired functionality within minutes at service, like auto door locking, windows pan-tilt when in reverse, etc.  Love the memory seats and mirrors and dual climate control with heated seats.  fun + functionality = Best Sport Wagon Loved my A4 2.8 sedan - but strollers &\\rgolf clubs just didn\\'t go well together\\rin the trunk.  Found my car thru the\\rgreat audit certified site and had it\\rshipped.  Audi certified program is one\\rof the best out there.  Love the service\\r& all problems to date corrected without\\rjumping thru hoops.  As for the car - a\\rblast to drive, looks great inside and\\rout.  as a coworker told me - \"your car\\rLOOKS fast\" - and it is.  Perfect\\ralternative to those small suv\\'s - all\\rwheel drive piece of mind for our\\rnortheast winters, and room inside and\\rontop for your \"toys\".  A4 Avant - The Anti-SUV Aside from having defective Spark \\rModules which required two separate \\rservice visits (one with only 63 miles \\ron the car) and a failed Transmission \\rControl Module, this car has been 100% \\rreliable and an absolute joy to own and \\rdrive. I can\\'t understand why there \\raren\\'t more of them on the road, it\\'s a \\rgreat Anti-SUV! With my snow tires on \\rin winter I run circles around any of \\rthem and get WAY better gas mileage, \\rtoo. The car is also perfect for long \\rtrips, just eats up the miles in \\rcomfort and returns 25MPG at 75MPH! \\rAgain, no SUV can touch that. Excellent SUV Alternative My wife and I bought this car a month \\rago, and we love it already. You rarely \\rsee A4 Avants, unlike the ubiquitous \\rBMW/Volvo/VW wagons. It\\'s also a superb \\rvalue, especially Certified. I laugh at \\rSUV drivers who paid a lot more for \\rterrible handling, fuel economy, and in \\rsome cases, less room. It will not \\roverwhelm you with power, but it\\'s got \\rplenty of zip for a family car, and \\rQuattro ensures excellent handling. \\rIt\\'s not big, but it\\'s very \\rcomfortable. The interior lighting is \\rgreat- at night, EVERY control lights \\rup so you don\\'t have to fumble in the \\rdark. It\\x92s a really intelligently \\rdesigned car with great attention to \\rdetail. Very highly recommended! The Best Wagon I have ever owned After driving a Subaru for 6 years, the \\rAudi Avant 3.0 is a dream.  and the \\rprice differential of the two is not so \\rbig anymore and the folks at Audi Of \\rNashua are outstanding.  Everyone is \\rfriendly and helpful.  But lets get to \\rthe car.  Styling is superb - in and \\rout.  Performance of the 3.0 is \\rsuperb.  I love the way the car drives, \\rpasses, and handles the curvy roads.  \\rRoom isn\\'t bad for storing your bike or \\r4 Ski Bags.  If I needed more room, I \\rwould have gone with the A-6.  \\rWhats not to like After two years... I ordered my A4 Avant with the Sport \\rSuspension and Summer Performance Tires \\rwithout being able to test drive one set up \\rthat way.  What a hoot!  The car tracks like it\\'s \\ron rails!  To the person who complained that \\rthe Sport Suspension wasn\\'t a \"luxury\" ride... \\rDUH!  If you want a luxury ride you don\\'t order \\ra Sport Suspension.  The Audi A4 Avant \\rhandles as well as my wife\\'s BMW (maybe \\rbetter) and is plenty fast (especially using the \\rtiptronic... which I personally like better than a \\rmanual).  The car has been 100% reliable and, \\rin my opinion, is one of the best looking cars \\ron the road.  \\rWhat\\'s not to love? Beware of temperature sensitive glass rear hatch/door window is very fragile  BACK TO THE DEALER My wife has owned this vehicle for  Beautiful, with a few hiccups Bought this car for my wife, who LOVES \\rit.  I love the styling, superb \\rinterior quality, versatility of the \\rwagon.  Problems include the well-known \\rcoilpack failure which completely \\rdisabled the car requiring flatbed \\rtowing to the dealership after 7,000 \\rmiles.  Not what I would expect in a \\rcar of this caliber.  Now we are \\rhesitant to take this practically brand \\rnew car on extended road trips because \\rwe are worried about breaking down.  \\rBecause of short supply, the dealership \\rwill not replace all of the coilpacks \\runder warranty, only if they fail (and \\rleave you stranded!)\\r Rims have been a headache (see \\rSuggested Improvements, below) Female Driver I special ordered this vehicle and \\rwaited 4 months for it to arrive.  I \\rnever had a chance to test drive and A4 \\rAvant 3.0 6 speed manual with sport \\rpackage. It is too small, very \\runcomfortable, rough ride, and the most \\rdifficult stick shift I have ever \\rowned.  Some of my most favorite \\rfeatures are not even offered on the \\rcar.  I would love to get rid of it.  I \\rhave extreame buyers remorse.  I get \\rsick every time I drive the car because \\rof the rought ride and the amount I \\rpaid for the car. Best Looking AWD This is the best AWD Wagon that I have \\rseen.  This is my second A4 and things \\rjust keep getting better.  Why pay \\rextra for the standard or should I say \\rluxury of a center armrest (BMW you \\rmust be joking).\\r The Car looks like a complete dream, \\rall round an excellent purchase thought \\rnot quite as much interior load as I \\rthough I was going to get.  The Sedan \\rboot is huge. Avant Was skeptical about buying a first \\rmodel year car. Additionally, our last \\r1999 A4 was plagued with mechanical \\rissues. However, Audi service is \\rexcellent and made up for our troubles. \\rWe took the plunge and bought this car \\ranyway (for a wagon, it\\'s gorgeous). \\r6000 miles thus far with no problems. \\rCar is much better all around than \\rprevious model. Very happy with \\rpurchase. Best of the Best I\\'ve been owning BMW 328I for 5 years \\rnow and we wanted to buy a sports wagon.\\rChoices were: BMW 325 or Audi A4. \\rA4 is better value. Styling is perfect, \\rdriving a car is pleasant. Car handles \\ras it should be for a German automobile.\\rVery satisfied with A4 Avant. \\rWe\\'ll see how the quality of the car \\rturn up in the next 5 years or more. AUDI - Accelerates under demonic influen This car is not for anyone that likes \\racceleration of the start.\\rThe build quality is fine and the \\rinterior build quality is fine, but if \\ryou like performance this car is not \\rfor you Audi A4 CVT is the best out there. Audi A4  I love the fact that my wife will be  Audi A4  Interior is best I have seen, \\reverything else is self-explanatory. small gripes with reliability  If this car had the reliability of \\rLexus (which by the way most German \\rcars don\\'t), then it would be that much \\rbetter.  At about 5k miles, I have had \\rto bring the car in for minor \\relectrical glitches, not uncommon for \\rEuropean cars.  Other than that, this \\rcar is a dream, puts a smile on my \\rface.  The sport package gives a \\rslightly harsh ride but handles \\rpotholes and bumps rather firmly if not \\rwell. My best buy Love this car. No complaints. Handles \\rlke a dream, worth every cent. Would \\rnot trade this car for anything. BUY IT! Great Car This is a great car.  Handles well, looks great and is comfortable.  It seems to be loosening up the more miles that gets put on it, so I am not complaining too much about performance anymore.  The interior materials are, as always, excellent and the build quality is excellent.  As I write this, there is about 3200 miles on the car and I have not had any problems.  The sport wheels that come with the Avant are awesome looking! Audi A4  The interior of this car sold me, there \\ris no other car with a better class and \\rdesign for the money than this car. Our Very First... Today is the 2nd-week (900 miles) \\ranniversary of our first Audi - the A4 \\r3.0 Avant. What a great car. My \\rhusband and I love everything about \\rthe A4. I love the styling and the \\rdual temperture control, and my \\rhusband loves the power and handling \\r(he autocrosses regular in his 914). \\r Comparing to all our previous cars, 3 \\rseries, E-class, and Discovery, this \\ris the funnest car to own and to drive.\\r     All-around best sport wagon When considering ALL factors, especially performance, styling and price - the A4 comes out heads above the rest.  Drive all of the AWD sport wagons(BMW, Volvo, even Subaru, etc.) and decide for yourself.  You can\\'t beat the Quattro  system.  Living in a heavy snow climate (upstate NY) getting dedicated winter tires is a must, but well worth it.  I have nothing bad to say about this car. Avant This is my second A4 (1.8T prior) performance is excellent with the 3.0.  Instead of 30 mpg, I now only get around 25mpg.  Car looks good, drives good.  Exceeds my expectations. Better than a BMW? The A4 is a great car.  Looks great, drives great has probably the best interior of any car that starts under 30K and with options like Quattro you can understand why Audi has been so successful with this car.\\r Probably the best feature of this car is the relative sparsity of them compared to the BMW 3 series.  I see at least 10 black 3 series cars every day on my way to work.  So if you\\'re looking for something a little special, the A4 is a great choice. Awesome Just to put it in perspective - -I bought a 2002 Subaru Outback VDC Wagon for about the same price as the Audi A4 1.8 Quattro Wagon with options.\\r I was so blown away when I drove my freinds Audi shortly after I bought the Outback - that I traded it in, took the loss, and got my Audi - -For 30k, there simpy isnt another car that drives like an suid, with all of the safety, conformt and style to boot. ...You just might like it !!!!!! I have to say of all of the different entry level luxury cars... The A4\\'s in/outside design surpasses many cars twice it\\'s price !  Please, BMW is seen way too often... and more often you are paying through the teeth to own one... only later to find out what type of value you had passed by !!!  Trust me, three friends ( BMW drivers ) have clued me in.  \\r If it is only for an around the block drive... This car is going to surprise you again and again ! My Audi Experience I\\'ve had this car for about 1 1/2 years. I bought the car for $3,000 but ever since I\\'ve had to change coils and spark plugs left and right. Oil and Power Steering seems impossible to get them to stop leaking. I just replaced the motor and catalytic converter, fuel pump, suspension, axles, a ton of interior parts, oil sensor and turbo. I did get the car with a ton of miles though. I believe it had about 215k. It was a stupid discussion on buying it. When I first got the car about 2 months with it I had put about 3.5k into it just to get the checking engine light off that at that point I had put tooooo much money to sell it. I keep having to put money into this car every 2-3 month to keep it running smooth. With all that said, the car drives amazing car doesn\\'t make any noise  beside when you step on it. Its super comfortable and pretty fast for the weight of the car. The Quattro is the best thing ever! Handles better then any car i\\'ve driven. I\\'ll take issue with BMW BMW claims \"the ultimate driving machine\". I would take this car any day of the week over a 3 series. Very fun to drive with little to no issues over the past 6+ years. Like all German car part and repairs are not cheap. That said I have had nothing major happen with my car but I do not allows little things go unchecked. If you do the maintenance and stay on top of the warnings you can get 200K or more miles out of these cars. A little word to anyone interested in buy a German car, run premium fuel. They like it better and will save you money in the long run!!!! Take care of it and it will take care of you I have owned this car for 8 years and 100k miles.  I bought it from the first owner with 85,000 miles.  It now has 200,185.  In the ten years I have owned it, I have religiously changed the oil every 5k miles with Mobil 1 0w40 and Mahle oil filter.  I have done all the work on this car myself (timing belt 2X... thank you Blauparts, all control arms, shocks, brakes and various sensors).  Now that the car is getting older, there have been more aging items to replace (vacuum hoses, fuel pump, more sensors... this car has a ton).  If you are not interested in maintaining the car, don\\'t get it; it will be a major headache.  If you can maintain the car, it will be one of the best cars you have every owned.  Amazingly stable and confident driving in all road conditions.  Comfortable and well laid out interior.  I particularly love that it was one of the last generations before they started stocking them full of touch screen and navigation displays that distract.  Also, one of the last generations to have the sport suspension and six speed manual with the 6 cylinder and \"luxury\" interior.  It’s a car that doesn’t need all the infotainment garbage because the experience of driving is the enjoyment. Excellent car 02 audi a4 1.8t quattro manual speed. I owned it for a very long time and now has 233765 miles on it  with still original head gasket, starter, turbo, alternator. No engine leaks and performs fantastic. No issue on shifting or anything else. Just a regular maintenance. AMS oil every 4000 miles, and 93 octane and it goes. I love it. Always Audi owner. Love my red a4 3.0 quattro Great car, super fun to drive. Plenty of torque at normal rpm range and lots of grip around the corners! Front seats are plush and comfy although rear seating is tight. Car is equipped with power everything; mirrors, sunfoof, windows, seats, etc... This car\\'s grip, power, and planted feel blew my mind when I first test drove it. Before i had a 2001 passat 2.8, and this thing just runs circles around that. Great car that i would recommend. Typical Euro car with high maintenance needs I\\'ve owned the car since new with 220K miles. It has never been to the dealer or private mechanic except for the initial free maint and the few minor recalls.However, that is not to say it has not had its share of anomalies.Three timing belts, 3 water pumps, 3 batteries, One fuel pump, too many coil packs to count, one temp sensor, two valve cover gaskets and one thermostat.All this may sound horrible and it probably would be if I had no mechanical aptitude or desire to do my own repairs.The car is actually easy to work on.Very modular in the way things come apart.Information is readily available on the Net.I\\'ve kept this car because the 1.8T engine block is bullet proof.Update (4/22/16):  I still own this car and it now has over 250K miles and still runs strong.  The original turbo hasn\\'t had any problems and the engine still has good compression on all 4 cylinders.  Synthetic oil is a must for this engine. The clutch was recently replaced and that was a major project. Another fuel pump failed leaving me stranded at the office, again.  It seems the \"Check Engine\" light is always about to illuminate as various high mileage sensors fail.  New upgraded brake rotors on all four corners has improved braking.  There are a lot of great resources on the web dedicated to these cars and I have been able to find detailed instructions for all issues I\\'ve experienced.  Overall I\\'m pleased with this car as it is a well balanced performance sedan.  However, if you are not mechanically inclined and don\\'t enjoy the challenge of researching a given problem, order parts and installing the parts, then you\\'re left with paying some mechanic big bucks to keep it road worthy.Update 10/22/16: My A4 now has more than 260k miles on the odo. Original engine and turbo still going strong. Getting close to needing its 4th timing belt service. The latest issues I\\'m dealing with: New radiator. FM reception is bad due to the small antenna amp near the back window. It\\'s a common problem. Roof liner in the back is getting loose and sagging. Three window regulators have been replaced. The driver seat backing keeps popping out and falling off. Typical stuff for an old car. However, coworkers that ride with me can\\'t believe how well it runs and looks. I often want to have a new car but can\\'t justify it given the fact that this car just keeps going. One just has to stay on top of all the annoying little things that need attention. stay away! this car was bought from my family brand new then passed down to me. i have had nothing but probs in this 3.0 v6 quattro. it had turned into a money pit. the coils, cats, timing belt, power steering pump, all this money and still not fixed completely. moon roof wont stay open or close without playing around with it. starter is starting to go. rpms rev when idling. overall very dissapointed in this car. done with audi/vw! The Audi A4 V6 3.0 Are Made for Speed Period This car is a serious driving machine. It is not meant to be garaged or driven on Sunday\\'s to church. Much worse driven leisurely. This car is a monster and I did nothing to the engine. The only thing I added was a K & N filter to replace the factory one which in effect added another 15 hp simply because of the additional air coming in. From the moment you turn the car on you can hear the engine which to me was like music to my ears. I drove this car to the limit and had more than enough fun doing it. If I had to put it in 6th gear I was over a 100MPH easily. The highway drive was phenomenal. Man what a car. I bought it with 30k and trade it at 102k. Perfect in every sense of the word. Like the other reviews Much like the other reviews, this car was fabulous from an interior fit and finish perspective, but something was always breaking and it was always costly; I had wiper linkage seize up which was over $300, H.I.D light (dipped headlight) which was $300, and many more. It seemed like everything that had an issue it was $300 or more. There were also odd electrical gremlins with the radio and sunroof (sunroof was blamed on a potentiometer, and the radio was blamed on lithium grease in the door connectors). I got great gas mileage on this car but overall it\\'s a great car if you can afford the pricey repairs. - 1.8t six speed automatic, fwd model Disappointed This thing is a money pit.  Can\\'t believe how much it costs to fix every little thing.  Have had the car almost 4 years now & I can\\'t take it any more.  If you happen to be looking at one of these things, stay away. Too many expensive repairs The 2002 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro was fun to drive and great in the snow but the repairs killed the bank! They were so expensive and something was always going wrong with the car. I wouldn\\'t suggest buying one or any Audi for that matter unless you are willing to put thousands into the car! Buyer beware! So Long, Audi Bought this car almost two years ago from an Audi dealership. Sadly, the engine has failed due to the infamous oil sludge build-up issue in the 1.8T engine. Car was always maintained at Audi dealer. The car is beautiful...but it will be moving on to greener pastures with someone who would like to put a new engine in it. Timing belt also had to be replaced, ignition coils, etc. Too many recalls for \"Truth in Engineering\", Audi. Great Car I get up to 36 mpg on the Interstate at 70, average 27 total including around town, uses no oil between 5000 mile changes, BE SURE to use synthetic and change it as the turbo is hard on oil, change the CVT every 50K, everything works like brand new on this car, no wind leaks, no rattles, no rust, no squeaks. Change the timing belt every 100K, brakes last 50K plus, has original shocks and they are still good. =(  Bought that Audi 4 months ago, 3k miles and 3000 dollars I spend for keeping it running. Oil leak, pump(timing belt), catalytic, heater  problems, ignition coils...and some more...14 - 15mpg in a city. It looks really great, but i\\'m afraid to drive it, anything could break anytime... A4 quattro 1.8 I purchased this car with 57k miles 2 years ago. Now I have 84k and I only had a few problems. Power steering fluid was leaking and engine speed sensor and also my moonroof won\\'t stay open. I enjoy driving the car especially in the winter when there\\'s snow on the ground! It\\'s fun! I haven\\'t had a major problem but I am scared coz someone I know has the same exact car and his timing belt broke at 85k. It is not a cheap car to fix nor maintain but I try my best. Great little car I originally bought the 5sp. manual Audi A4 1.8t used with 95,000 miles on the odometer. 15 minutes after driving it away from the dealer, the car nearly broke down, so we drove it back and they replaced an engine coil and all was fine. I went about 10,000 miles with an oil change every 3k miles, and one day when I started it up the engine was acting funny and the check engine and oil light came on, indicating that there were signs of oil sludge buildup, which I read is quite common in the 1.8t, due to design flaw. Now, the radio acts up. However I love this car regardless. Such a fun, attractive, luxurious little car. Get the 3.0 Well it looks like I see a trend here.  The 1.8T seem to have reliability issues while the 3.0 seem to run strong.  I have owned mine for a year and love it.  It\\'s my second Audi, my first being an 80Q that I put 300k miles on.  I will say that these cars require your attention.  By that I mean don\\'t skimp on maintenance.  If there are issues, fix them IMMEDIATELY or it can get very expensive (i.e. ignore replacing a $25 coil pack and you could spend $1000 on a new cat).  I will also say you need to keep the interior conditioned, it doesn\\'t like being left to dry out on hot days.      Audi does it best I leased my A4 because I wasn\\'t sure I would like driving a stick after a lot of years of automatics but this car changed all that. It has been a fantastic performer in all kinds of weather conditions and having a stick takes me back to when I was 16. I liked the A4 so much, I bought it outright and bought a 2 year warranty extension from the dealer. Had a couple of repairs made under the warranty but overall I have no complaints with the cars reliability up to this point with 58K miles on it. I got everything available except Bose audio and Xenon headlights. Heated seats are great in winter and very comfortable. This is the best car I ever owned.. and I\\'ve owned 11 different cars. Waiting for the other shoes to drop I\\'ve put a steady 12K a year on this car in a mix of city & freeway driving, up to the 75K I have now. After the 4- year lease was up, which coincided with the 50K-mile warranty, I bought the car outright and on a hunch bought a 70K- mile extended warranty.  Great hunch! It paid for itself twice over, but now that it has expired I\\'m dreading the next major expense and wondering what it will be. Though I still love the vehicle, its looks & ride, it may be time to move on before the pit of mechanical-breakdown hell opens up. One amazing point: At 75K miles I have never needed new brakes thanks to careful driving and downshifting rather than braking at every opportunity (though I will soon) Lemon Aid Too many expensive repairs has taken the fun out of this car.  I will miss the way it drives and extras, like the Bose stereo system, when I soon buy something different. 75k and still going This is my second Audi (prev 4000CS) and am pleased with the way the car has performed. I first bought the auto in Seattle and had shipped to Europe (wanted US specs) and had it up to 128 mph. It drove flawless on the Autostrata! I purchased with the Phatbox and so I can enjoy my MP3s. The leatherette seats hold up better than the real leather seats my friend purchased with his Audi A4. Only big issue is that you must change the extended oil religeously with the turbo motor as it will cook the oil in the return pipe and cause the warning light to come on.  It\\'s a costly fix so beware. Overall the car is joy to drive when I can get away from my wife. Economical yet has power. Love it! Would buy another Audi A4 1.8T My Audi A4 was recently totalled. Since its gone, I can fully appreciate what I had. Exterior design was so much so that I didn\\'t want to trade it in for a newer model. The engine lagged a little at slower speeds, but remained smooth and controllable at higher speeds, including quick turns. Seating was good.  Heated and light dimming mirrors were a bonus. Many, hard to find features were a bonus as well. This car was my Silver Bullet. I had normal wear issues, but they were expected. No electrical issues to report. The moonroof was quiet and the all around heated seats, power up and down windows made everyone comfortable. Looking to by another A4 or A6 soon. Will Cost You a Ton My A4 was great under warranty, too bad that expired at 50,000 miles. Lately it\\'s cost about $600 a month just to keep it running, and I\\'ve only got 90,000 miles on it. Oh and the dealership just told me I needed to replace the timing belt ($1,350) when I took it in to get checked out for the class action suit against Audi. So needless to say I will never buy another Audi agian or ever recommend anyone buy one.   May I have Another! I was hesitant to purchase another VW built car after the dismal experience I had with my 1999 VW Passat but I went ahead and purchsed a 2002 Audi Quattro A4. I am very happy with the car. I drive my cars hard and put at least 20k miles/year commuting to work and I have yet to experience any major problems. The car handles great on the highway and in third gear at 3000rpm, there isn\\'t many cars she cannot pass. The secret to keeping these cars in great shape is to find a reputable mechanic who knows and works on Audi cars daily. Knowing that I drive my cars hard i take it in the shop about every two months for a checkup. I was also prudent and purchased the 100k extended warranty. Great Car This is the first Audi that I\\'ve owned and have been nothing but satisfied with this car and Audi. The car looks great on the interior and exterior and is a great value for the money. Not to mention, it is fun to drive, gets decent gas mileage and is incredibly safe. I was in an accident in this car where someone hit me in the passenger door when running a red light. The car was damaged but I was able to get out completely unharmed. A friend was in a similar accident and her car was totaled and she had back injuries. This car is safe, fun, and all about luxury. Downhill After 45K After 45K miles, my 2002 Audi A4 1.8T (now at 53K miles) began to require very expensive repairs that I never needed for other vehicles I owned with over 100k miles. I had to replace the phlange that connected the coolant system to the engine, the steering rack and pinion, the windshield/headlight washing fluid pump and motor, and the dealer says that I need to soon replace engine gaskets. I do not know much about the mechanics of cars, but from my experience, it is unusual that such major repairs would be required on a vehicle that still has relatively low mileage and is owned by someone who is very diligent with all of the routine maintenance. Wish I had purchased the extended warranty! Do not buy We bought this car thinking it was going to be reliable.  After 2 years we had to replace the engine, now at 100,000 miles we need a new transmission.  It has been one thing after the other and I will never buy an Audi ever again.  Nobs all wear or fall off, interior tears, head lights burn out every 2 seconds. Not only have I spent tons of money having to repair the car I want to get rid of it and it isn\\'t worth anything, horrible resale. Bad bad bad, that is all I have to say! This is Audi #3 This is the third Audi for me. I bought my first one used w/60,000 miles- an Audi 90 and donated it with 173,000 on it. It was great. I bought an Audi 90 brand new and put 194,000 miles on it. Another great driving car. Now I have an Audi A4 3.0 Quattro 6sp. manual and I love it. It had 32,000 miles on it when I bought it and not a scratch on it. I love the summer package (wide wheels) but they ride rough. The winter tired were great for Ohio snow.   Not for long commutes This car is cute and fun.  But don\\'t drive it too much.  By 2007, with all the repairs we\\'ve already done and those still coming up, this car has depreciated like a rock and we\\'re left holding the bag, wondering when our next $2,000 repair bill will come up.  The overcomplicated German design leaves even the smallest repairs costing more than they should, and the benefit - our cute car - has been blackened by our repair bills. Smooth like butter, but eats up coils We\\'ve owned this baby since its birth. The paint and fit and finish are still like new. The 1.8T quattro w 5spd manual has plenty of power and is great in snow. No real issues but we\\'re on our 3rd set of ignition coils ($400 ea time). Our horn kept shorting out until they finally fixed the bracket (5 repairs later). The power steering fluid has a slow leak and ANY routine repair is pricey ($83 to replace 2 burnt out tail light bulbs!), but the ride and handling are still superb. We still love our A4 and it\\'s just like new after 5+ years. Would highly recommend this car. One of the worst cars I have ever owned Loads of electrical gremlins.  Spontaneously the alarm used to go off when I first got it.  Radio problems, speakers cutting in and out, tweeter still busted.  Dealers want $300 to replace a battery, recently paid $475 to diagnose and replace 3 feet of vacuum hose for a check engine light.  Brakes were shot in 36,000 miles (my other car was good for 50,000 so it is not my driving) and tires the same.  It was fun to drive when I bought it.  Should have bought reliability.  Maybe mine was just a lemon but I would not shop Audi/VW again. Transmission Killer I love the way this car looks, feels and drives, however...  We just put in our third new replacement transmission!!  The car has been in the shop for 4 months out of the last two years.  The mechanic had to order the tranny from Germany as they are on back order in the US.  The transmissions are about $7000 a piece.  Thank God for extended warranties!! Buyer beware. Pure Satisfaction I love this car!! After owning it for 4 1/2 years, I still feel the same as when I purchased it new. It has the sports suspension which handles very well. This vehicle is the first automatic transmission I have owned, therefore, having the CVT transmission has been wonderful. There is no hesitation when going through the gears upon acceleration and is smooth as can be. The seat is comfortable and the ride is quiet. The stiffer sports suspension is exactly what one expects from BMW. This car has had NO electrical or engine problems and is very reliable. A new dealership which opened closer to my home (after owning my car for 2 years) is top notch; offering car washes, and prompt service. Stick shift 3.0  smokin\\' ride I really love this car.  The 6 speed makes it a blast to drive and the performance is really good.  All wheel drive makes winters fun too. Built nice and strong.  Love this car and it loves me. Audi A4 1.8T I bought my Audi from Audi USA (used with 3k).  I bought it over the internet and shipped to Europe (wanted US Spec Car).  I drove the car up to 128 MPH and it ran flawlessly.  Hugged the road and driving at 100 MPH felt like going 55.  I did have a problem with the gas cap sensor that Audi corrected.  Overall the car has been great and provides super gas mileage while providing umph when you need it.  It has the normal turbo lag but overall very pleased.  Back seat could be a touch larger.  Very glad I got the 1.8T motor over the 3.0.  I had 3 series BMW before this one and prior had the Audi 4000CS.  Not knocking the BMW but find the Audi more of a joy to drive.  Enjoy!!! Over enginered This is a very comfortable, stable and fun car. I am a small woman and the car fits me perfectly. It has all the bells and whistles and a great highway ride. There is some lack of power initially at low speeds but the engine quickly responds. My major complaint is that the computer system is overly sensitive there have been many instances of warning lights coming on. I say that the car is \"over enginered\".  I have had the car into the dealer on many more occasions than I think is reasonable for warning lights. Sometimes there was something actually wrong but many times the computer just needed to be reset. Head Turner Excellent vehicle, fun to drive and you are guaranteed to turn heads.  Get a warranty, bought it used and it was over the 50,000 mark, expensive to fix (2000 for a clutch).  I would buy another a4 in a heartbeat. great \"german\" Awesome exterior and interior. There is more space inside than I expected. Very comfortable to drive - more than Mercedes or BMW that I owned before. Reliable on curves. Low gas mileage, but if you want to save on gas, buy a chain saw! disappointed The A4 is a nice looking car that doesn\\'t deliver. If you are looking to purchase this car, take the extended warranty and make sure the dealership is close. There are many gremlins that will keep your dash warning lights lit up. German Dependability and ingenuity This car has been a joy to own. The four years/50,000 mile warrenty has been a blessing. The car is a joy to drive.  Audi A4 1.8T CVT This is my second Audi (4000CS) and am very pleased with the performance and reliability of the car.  We purchased the car used (3k) and had it shipped to Europe where it was driven till 05.  The vehicle worked flawless!!!  Had it up to 130MPH many times between Naples and Rome and always hugged the road.  The CVT trans is great on gas as well as the 1.8T driving around town.  Overall I\\'d own another Audi.  Glad I didn\\'t get the 3.0 as it has more pickup power at the start but about the same as the 1.8T once you get going.   1 sweet car Sweet car, but taillights keep going out. Love the power memory seats, only car in its class I know of that has rear heated seats, love the looks, turns a lotta heads. I think audi is a great German brand, it\\'s a real nice car (I have the auto). Tales of the Audi Has been a reliable vehicle.  Some niggling deficiencies with the interior build quality; few things are a bit too \"soft\" to the touch and can break easily.  Otherwise an excellent vehicle that I will always find pleasure in looking at. Buy this car. I had to make a new car purchase quickly after my car got totaled.  I was looking at Infinitis and Acuras, when I cam across the A4 by accident.  In short, its a great car that is fun to drive, looks great, and does everything it needs to (transport people, stuff, whatever).  The turbo hurts fuel efficiency, but not terribly.  Otherwise, I don\\'t think I could have found a better car for my needs and wants. Can\\'t go wrong with an audi This vehicle is the perfect car to drive. I haven\\'t had any real problems with this car. I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna have any either. This is my second audi and the first one gave me about 140,000 miles and was willing to give me more but I decided that I wanted newer. The 3.0 liter engine is fast and strong. The style of the car inside and out are great and the quattro system is always a great add on. Nothing I can say bad about this car. Don\\'t Buy One This car has been in the shop more than I have had it at my house. I am currently out of warranty and nobody wants to work on this car so I\\'m forced to pay through the nose at the dealer. Every headlamp, side marker, tail lamp has burned out twice sinced I\\'ve owned the vehicle.  The vaccuum hoses have busted, the w/s wiper motor burned out, the cd player quit working, the computer went bad, it eats tires like crazy and the list goes on and on. Besides that it is a great vehicle? Prior to this vehicle I owned an Acura and traded it in at 90k miles and never had any issues except for replacing the tires.  I will definitely go back to the Acura line and would not recommend Audi to anyone. Worst Car I\\'ve ever owned! In my 30+ years of driving, I\\'ve owned Corvairs and AMC products that would be considered \"problem cars\", but nothing matches the unreliability of an Audi. I purchased both a 2001 and 2002 A4 and have become very familiar with the local wrecker companies. The 2002 is now having it\\'s 4th engine installed (after only 50,000 miles). The stereo system has been replaced three times. We traded in the 2001 at a loss after being towed three times for coil issues. Stay away from Audi! This is the worst car I\\'ve ever owned, including the 1964 Corvair I paid $100 for in 1974! Sad \"Audi Experience! Unfortunately, our experience has not \\rbeen a happy one. Audi is presently \\rinstalling our third engine in our 2002 A4 after \\ronly 50,000 miles! Our car has spent \\rnearly 3 months in the shop in the past \\r36 months. We\\'ve bought a new Maxima \\rand plan to sell our Audi as soon as \\rpossible. Still love this car after 56000 miles Strengths: Stong 3.0 liter is a joy to \\rdrive, Tiptronic adapts to your driving \\rmood and style. The interior is \\rbeautiful and funtional. This design \\rstill looks as fresh as it did 3 years \\rago.\\rWeaknesses: Bose Stereo is not up to \\rthe level of the rest of this car, the \\rpassenger seat is not comfortable (so \\rsay my wife & son).The interior has not \\rworn all that well. Reliability has \\rbeen OK, the coils failed the same week \\rthat I received the recall notice. The \\rbolt holding a pulley onto the engine \\rfell out , an oil seal failed which \\rleft me stranded.Conclusions: I think \\rthat the A-4 is a better built car than \\rmy wifes M-B 240 AWD. I\\'m ordering a \\rnew A-6. Great German Automobile I purchased a pre-owned A4 and have \\rbeen thrilled with the car. Additional \\r2 years of bumber-bumper pre-owned \\rwarranty is great. Car rides beautiful. \\rTight German feel. Hugs the road. The \\r1.8T has great torque. Could be more \\rpowerful, especially with Quattro \\rdrive, but gas mileage is great. I \\rswitched to synthetic oil and larger \\rcapacity filter and have been getting \\rover 30 mpg highway. Car has tons of \\rgreat features and electronics. Safety \\ris excellent. I\\'ve had no problems with \\rthis vehicle and hope to own if for \\rmany years. Too bad my wife gets to \\rdrive it all the time. 3 Years of Good Performance It\\'s Reliable\\rI have owned this car for 3 years. \\rUntil last month, I have never seen the \\rengine until I had to give a lady in an \\r85 Ford Taurus a jump.  I highly \\rrecommend Free maintenance. \\r To illustrate \\rMy best friend has a 01 Civic, over two \\ryears, he has paid $19-$29 for 14 oil \\rchanges. $690 in repairs and tune-up \\rcost and $60 for tire rotation. \\rI have paid $109 for two rotations \\rafter Three years!\\rThe service plan is flawless.  \\rEverything is free, oil, brakes, \\ranything except gas.  Free maintenance \\rfor 50K miles, how can you go wrong?\\rThat said,  It does need attention but \\revery car does there is no such thing \\ras a maintenance free car.. A+ for my A4 Bought my A4Q 5 speed 2 years ago, \\rhave driven from OH to MA twice, \\rthough local mileage is low (have 20K \\ron ODO). The car has been flawless!! \\rAudi Symphony Sound system is \\rexcellent. Car is still quiet, handles \\rbeautifully and is tight and \\rresponsive. Still running Pirelli P6\\'s.\\rEverything works as well as the day I \\rtook it home. Best car I have ever \\rowened!! 02 Audi A4 3.0 What a fun car to drive, with the \\rmanumatic shifter!  The fun of a \\rstandard, but also the ease and \\rconvenience of an automatic \\rtransmission.  My only complaint about \\rthis car is the relatively small amount \\rof storage - pockets in the doors and \\ron back of the front seats, but hardly \\rany room for CDs or sunglasses. This is not a chevy I bought a 2003 1.8T A4 just over a  Luxury car goes easy on the wallet too I had this Audi for a while and just \\rlove it. It has got the good looks \\rplus the drive is fun too. The CVT \\rfeature helps when you want to get the \\rpower out of the car, which is not too \\revident when in automatic. The Best Car ever build Build quality is exceptional. This is  Bose stereo - not impressed The Bose stereo is a weakness. Sound  Love it! Love this car!!!!  If you are looking \\rin this price range, stop looking and \\rjust go buy the Audi A4, AWD, 3.0 Has Been Good to Me Sorry for those of you who have had \\rtrouble.  Maybe the A4 3.0 engine is \\rlittle more friendly.  I wouldn\\'t \\rtrade mine for much of anything else \\ron the market.  One draw back, back \\rseats lack room. A4...avoid it like a plague When its actually working...its a nice \\rride. Expect it be in the shop as much \\ras its on the road. I have had this car \\rfor 2 years, with less then 28,000 \\rmiles...and since the day I drove it \\roff the lot I have had problems with \\rit. Audi ( local and corporate ) will \\ronly CONTINUE to fix the car under \\rterms of the warranty. If you are \\rlooking a good love/hate relationship \\rwith a car..then this is your car!! \\rOtherwise, avoid it like a plague!!!  horrible experience I\\'m the owner of a 2002 A4 1.8T quattro....car \\rbroke down 3 times within a year, was stuck \\r50 miles from my home in 20 degree \\rweather with my wife & 80 year old mother-\\rin-law (who suffers from alzheimers) for over \\r4 hours until roadside assistance pickedup \\rcar.... dealer would not approve rental car \\runtil they saw car (being roadside \\rasssitance took so long- dealer was \\rclosed!!!)... horrid experience, feel very \\runsafe in car, will never drive again! 2 years \\rleft on lease..... Buyer Beware This Audi is a nightmare. I had a 1999 \\r2.8Q, it was a great car. I wish I had \\rit back. This car has spent a cumlative \\r2.5 months at the dealer since Dec. \\r02.A brief list of mechanical issues, \\rignition coil, 3 Clutches, 2 windshield \\rwiper motors,a incredibly squeaky \\rdrivers seat, trunk latch failing while \\rvehicle was being driven,twice. \\r malfunctioning factory cd changer. Audi \\rcustomer service is non-existent and \\rrude. The car broke down out of state \\rand the local dealer refused to fix it, \\rbecause they didnt sell the car. I had \\rto pay several hundred dollars in tow \\rcharges. Audi refuses to reimburse any \\rof those or rent a car charges. Run \\raway from this car! Solid, Safe & Fun My first luxury car was worth the wait. \\rSolid car, feels safe to drive and has \\rthe features to back up the claims. Fit \\r& finish excellent inside and out.  \\r3.0L engine with the CVT is smooooth \\rand fast. I love the extra power it \\rdelivers at high speeds, passes others \\rwithout straining. Amazing car for the \\rmoney.  Drove the BMW-3 and chose the \\rA4 for FWdrive and price.  My wife \\rwouldn\\'t drive this car for the first 1 \\r1/2 years, too powerful.  Now I can\\'t \\rget it back from her. I love this car I just bought the car certified used \\rfor the wife and I\\'m actually \\rconsidering \\rgetting an SUV for her so that I can \\rhave the Audi for myself. I love it \\rthat much. The Audi engineers put so \\rmuch thought into what they design that \\rI\\'m still being surprised by neat \\rlittle features. My car came with the \\rsport package and, like what was \\rmentioned in an earlier review, the 1.8 \\ris a bit underpowered for the extra \\rhandling. The car sure handles, though, \\rand even better than \\rmany sports cars I\\'ve driven. Nice work \\rAudi. Good thing there\\'s a 50K warranty Love the A4 for its looks, both \\rinterior and exterior, and truly is a \\rfun car to drive.  It\\'s comfortable yet \\rsporty, with a tight ride. Just try to \\rdo doughnuts in the snow - this thing \\rgrips like a vice. The Bose system is \\rawesome.  Had an oil leak at 25K, the \\rrecall for the coils, door lock and \\rhorn stopped working and both needed to \\rbe replaced, and now there\\'s a \\rnoticeably rough idle and strong \\rgas/exhaust smell that appeared out of \\rnowhere, but dealer says nothing \\rfound.  Not a long term keeper in my \\ropinion, but an excellent 3 year or 4 \\ryear car for the ride, handling and \\rstatus.   The Best 4x4 Sports Wagon Out There 1st.  The Audi Dealership is hands \\rabove all the others in this class i.e. \\rI had a bad experience at a Subaru \\rDealership and a local VW Dealership.  \\rSo far, we love the Audi.  The 3.0 is \\rfun to smooth, fun to drive and fast.  \\rAll the little extras are nice.  Both \\rmy wife and I love this car.  We looked \\rat alot of cars and for the price, this \\rcar rocks.  The certified pre-owned \\rwarranty is great at 100G.  I would \\rrecommend this car to anyone.  Note, we \\rare coming from a Subaru that started \\rbreaking down after 100G.  Time will \\rtell.  Zoom Zoom Watch out! This car is fun to drive, espically \\rwith the CVT.  Seating takes some \\rgetting used to.  The climate control \\rsystem IS A FAILURE.  When cold outside \\rit is hot inside.  When the temperature \\rsetting is 64 deg.F the cabin stays at \\r74.  This is the LOWEST temperature \\ravailable.\\rAudi service has tried to fix it at \\rleast 5 times and finally concluded \\rthat it is \"Operating within \\rspecification\" since ALL of the cars do \\rthe same thing.  All of them are wrong \\raccording to the mechanic.\\rAlso experienced many other failures \\rthat have been fixed. As expected I work for an VW/Audi dealer so the \\rmaintenance \"issues\" are taken care of \\rimmediately, however I did not \\rappreciate the coil going at 3000 \\rmiles. I was told the \"vender\" was \\rhaving trouble with the new design. I \\rsee many more Audi\\'s come in on \\rflatbeds than VW\\'s.  One thing I can \\rdefinitely say is it\\'s the best car \\rever in snow which it why I bought the \\rcar and also for safety. I have seen \\rmany a customer who has literally \\rwalked away from accidents that in any \\rother cars would not have. Quattro is a \\rvery good system and please do not let \\ranyone tell you that the BMW is the \\rsame, it is not ask any mechanic \\rthey\\'ll tell you the difference.   A4 is a Perfect Balance Although not as quick as the BMW 3\\rseries,  but just as refined as the\\rMercedes Benz C Class, my 2002 A4 3.0\\rQuattro is a perfect vehicle for my 40\\rmile reverse highway commute.  Depending\\ron your mood, leave it to the plush\\rinterior and sound system, or the\\r\"Quattro-supreme\" road manners to keep\\ryou grinning from ear to ear. \\r My only complaint is a lack of low end\\rtorque from the V6 engine.\\r I\\'ve had this car for 6 months, and\\rstill get a kick out of driving to and\\rfrom work.\\r   JF Be careful what ya dream about Car has all options \\r.Never again!!!For a car in \\rthis price range to have so many \\rproblems.Coil pack failure\\r(stranded),brake failure(stranded)horn \\rfailure(needed for inspection,took 7 \\rmonths to get)and many other \\rproblems.Dealer acts like I\\'m bothering \\rhim with my problems(they left fog \\rlight trim off and wouldn\\'t return my \\rcalls)so Audi USA says to drive 60 \\rmiles to the next nearest dealer for \\rfuture service.Like many others, I\\'m \\rleary about taking this car on an \\rextended trip.Glad I kept my old 1999 \\rOlds Intrigue.It\\'s my daily driver and \\rhas never let me down. Quiet, smooth, confident After 20 years of driving strictly \\rAmerican cars, finally decided to test \\rdrive an Audi, and fell in love \\rimmediately.  BMWs are excellent, but I \\rfelt like I was spending $5000 for the \\rbrand name.  The A4 impresses with its \\rpower, solidity, quiet, and \\rsmoothness.  Even more impressive: the \\rinterior, quite simply the nicest car \\rinterior I\\'ve ever seen.  Little \\rtechnology flourishes abound but don\\'t \\rget in the way (example: twist the \\rmirror knob to the right and put the \\rcar in reverse, and the right mirror \\rtilts down to show you the curb you\\'re \\rparallel parking toward).  Overall, \\rsuperb! Great A4 Excellent all weather vehicle as snow  read the good AND bad!!!! BE OBJECTIVE! so ive owned my A4 for about a year and \\ra half, and now im on edmunds shopping \\rfor a decent used one.  i consider \\rmyself a demanding driver and as a \\rperformance vehicle, it\\'s a great \\rride.  but in the shop 14 times over \\rthe past year is insane!  clutch, \\rsuspension issues, ignition coils...  \\rthe worst was being a center console \\r(electronics) flake out that left me \\rusing a loner for a week.  CONSIDERING \\raftermarket chip?  risk screwing that \\rpowertrain warranty and you\\'ll have the \\rsweetest looking lawn ornament in \\rtown.  i wanted this thing to work \\rcause its sweet looking package.  but \\rive learned much more about cars than i \\rcared to through this headache. Puts a smile on my face everytime Overall this car is great.  The design of the \\rinterior and exterior is second to none.  \\rMinimalist with depth is the best way I can \\rdescribe it.  It is truly the car\\'s best feature.  \\rThe seats are tight and spartan (base vinyl \\rpackage), which does not bother me but \\rannoyed others.  \\rThe CVT drive is smooth as silk at speed but \\roff the line it can jump.  I have learned to \\rcontrol the acceleration better though I \\rsuppose since it rarely happens now.  The low \\rend torque leaves something to be desired but \\ronce the turbo kicks in you are off to the \\rraces, i.e. 1 second after you hit the \\raccelerator.  not too bad I purchesed the A4 AWD auto in december\\r2002 in florida $3,000 below sticker\\rprice, knowing that I am relocating to\\rwashington, where awd would be usefull\\rand dealers will not budge $500.00, it\\rsure serves the purpose during rainy\\rdays, had to replace the master cylinder\\rso far (warranty), the car looks great\\rwithout even the 17\" wheels and sports\\rpackage.  Maintenance Nightmare Expect to spend a lot of time at the  underpowered but nice Love the way this car tracks, but I\\'m \\rnot satisfied with the power. There are \\rvery few cars that are slower off the \\rline. This car needs about 40-50 more \\rhorsepower to be competitive. Low end \\rtorque is also weak. Totally Unsatisfied When I purchased this car for \\r39,000.00 I thought I was buying a \\rreliable car.  I quickly learned that \\rthis car is anything but reliable.  \\rThus far the blinkers went out, the \\rwindshield wiper blades broke, the \\rsterio died, the coolent hoses were \\rleaking the starting coils went out \\rand the entire dash board system \\rfailed so the car read 140 mph all the \\rtime.  Now my check engine light came \\ron last night and the car was in for \\rservice 1000 miles ago.  I am now \\rlooking to trade my car in on a much \\rmore reliable car like a Honda Accord. Dissapointing A-4 Bought car new, traded a \\'99 2.8Q, had \\rit for a week and had to return for a \\rclutch\"adjustment\",they actually \\rreplaced the clutch. First snow storm \\rmy windshield wipers failed completely \\r@ 2000 miles. The driver side seat \\rsqueaks like crazy, the trunk never \\rcloses correctely, and now @ 11000 \\rmiles the sunroof sticks when it \\rcloses, very fun when it rains. Oh for \\rpotential and current owners avoid the \\rfront end bra. I had mine dealer \\rinstalled, it flops like crazy over 80 \\rmiles an hour, it will destroy your \\rpaint job, dealer says it\\'s just the \\rway it is. It looks cool though it \\rdoes\\'nt work, kind of like the car it \\rwas designed for. gr8a4 As a long time VW driver I am very  a4 Review  Best car I have ever owned.  Great in \\rwinter, fun in the summer.  Service \\rfrom Audi is excellent.   IMPRESSIVE Since the A4\\'s introduction to the US I \\rhave wanted one and now I do.  The new \\rbody style is aggressive and masculine \\rwhich is indicative of its power.  The \\r1.8T is phenominal in its pickup speed \\rand at times I feel as if I am in the \\rDaytona 500, well maybe not to that \\rextent but you get my drift.  I did \\rtest drive the 02 Passat and Jetta in \\rorder to make a wise choice that the A4 \\rwas for me.  The Passat did not even \\rhave a chance. The sporty feel and \\rtight steering were not there and the \\rA4 had it all.  The Jetta was a strong \\rcontender with the A4, however, the A4 \\rwon me over with its robust exterior \\rand the luxurious interior.   German\\'s Rule the Road esp. Audi I have owned many cars in my 39 years \\rof life: 3 American, 6 Japanese, and 5 \\rGerman. I can say w/o a doubt that the \\rGerman made cars are the best. I\\'ve \\rowned 3 BMW\\'s, 1 Mercedes and my new \\r03 Audi A4. I can honestly say that no \\rone builds a car like the Germans.  Of \\rthe lot Mercedes ranks 3rd, BMW 2nd \\rand Audi is #1 as being the Best Car I \\rhave Ever Owned.  The Mercedes was a \\rgood car to drive but it was always in \\rthe shop for something. BMW ranks a \\rclose 2nd to the Audi, but it can\\'t \\rcompare to the fine int. and attention \\rto detail that Audi pays to its cars.  \\rIn my book Audi is the Gold Standard \\rthat all other Car companies should be \\rmeasured.  \\r Incredible! WHAT a car!  Much more than I \\rexpected.  Quattro is amazing and the \\rinterior puts the other German makes to \\rshame.  Audi is truly the benchmark of \\rGerman automobiles.  Power is smooth \\rand even, brakes strong, fuel mileage \\rvery good.  The difference between the \\rA4 and the BMW 325 is night and day, \\rwith the Audi taking honors. Initial Assessment I\\'ve owned the car for less than a \\rmonth, but right away some things are \\rapparent.  Biggest issue is lack of low-\\rend power - get a manual and this thing \\rwill DIE starting on an uphill incline \\runless you\\'re a master with the \\rclutch.  You can\\'t go above 5mph in \\rfirst gear; ridiculous.  Silver lining \\rthough -  increased fuel efficiency, \\rand once you have momentum the turbo \\rcan really kick in. Also, Audis start \\rto fall apart after 30,000 miles... \\rparticularly with all the extra \\rgadgetry that it comes equipped with.  \\rNo surprises here - just buy the \\rextended warranty. love it and hate it  love the car past 2nd gear and on \\rtwistys-hate the car at stop lights \\rwhen tauruses and accords aren\\'t \\rworking nearly as hard to go just as \\rfast or faster  - audi shouldn\\'t have \\rallowed 1.8T to be purchased with sport \\rpackage/wheels - this car looks fast \\rbut is not - remember guys, form        \\rfollow function!    plus my suspension \\rstarted squeeking like an old \\rstagecoach after 6 months - they still \\rhaven\\'t fixed it!! great looking and \\rcomfy overall - would buy another but \\reither v6 or s4 - never again 1.8T!! Audi Excellent Excellent car If this continues I will  My  Audi 1.8T All in all, the car has lived up to its \\rratings by the automotive press. \\rAcceleration from a standstill is not \\rthe greatest, until the turbocharger \\rkicks in... then it feels a lot \\rstronger and reacts. The sport \\rsuspension handles very well, but the \\ragressive tires are fairly noisy, \\respecially at highway speeds. \\rThe center console does restrict leg \\rmovement and can be a little \\runcomfortable for a taller driver. \\rThe seating is firm and may be \\rconsidered stiff by some. My boss thinks he\\'d paying me too much.. I gave my boss and some other coworkers \\ra lift the other day, and my boss was \\rimpressed. \"this is a great car. I\\'m  \\ramazed at the interior.\"  It is a great \\rcar. I looked at BMWs, Volvos, Saabs, \\retc., for style, safety, and \\rperformance. The A4 has it all. It\\'s a \\rtoy and it\\'s a statement. For safety, I \\rdon\\'t think it can be beat. On my way \\rhome tonight, a Jeep Cherokee ran a red \\rlight. It was rainy, the roads were \\rslick, I was at speed and yet the Audi \\rprevaled. I braked and swerved; my A4 \\rsteered right around that Jeep like I \\rwas dancing with butterflies. I am fast \\rbecoming one of Audi\\'s best \\rsalespersons. Love it, Hate dealer  First of all the obvious: needs more \\rpower, more leg room, a better sound \\rsystem, and the loaner car program is a \\rjoke.  \\r besides that what a great car: fun to \\rdrive, excellent build (tighter finish \\rand better materials than the past \\rthree infiniti\\'s we\\'ve owned), the CVT \\ris great and very interstate friendly. Beware After one year the car is back to the \\rshop about once a month. Once it was in \\rthe shop for a minor fender bender and \\rthe shop still can\\'t get it fixed after \\r4 trips and trust me it was a minor \\raccident.  I have been taking it to a \\rdealer in Charleston, WV.  The support \\rand repair for the car sucks.  The \\rdealer even offered to trade the car \\rand then offered me $14,000 less for \\rthe car than I payed for it after only \\rone year.  Don\\'t contact Audi with \\rcomplaints they don\\'t have any power or \\rdesire to deal with their dealerships.  \\rOn my way home from having a light bulb \\rchanged the whole taillight fell out \\rand all Audi could say is they would \\rdocument it.  Stunning The current A4, in my opinion, is one \\rof the most beautiful cars on the \\rroad.  It\\'s a head turner, it is one of \\ra few cars that really stands out from \\rthe rest.  It is also a blast to drive, \\rthe V6 engine performs well and sounds \\rgreat when driving it hard.  The \\rQuattro AWD system gives this car a \\rtremendous amount of road holding grip, \\rwhich is great for bad weather or \\rhaving a bit if fun. Not Bad, Could be Better I have a fairly loaded 2002 A4 3.0 quattro \\rwith 5-speed Tiptronic: sport, luxury, Cold \\rweather, xenons.  All-in-all this has been a \\rsatisfactory car.  Fit and finish was excellent.  \\rI have had a few niggling issues: horns had \\rto be replaced at 20,000 mi (horns, \\rwhatever?!), power steering fluid \\rmysteriously disappears (once, only).  The \\rTiptronic could be a little smoother on the \\rupshift, especially in low gears.  \\rAcceleration is a little weak, even for an \\rautomatic. Possibly expected too much? The ride is sweet and the engine sound \\ris like impeccable. I luv it except \\rfor a few things:\\r 1. i would rather the tiptronic \\rcontrols on the steering wheel be for \\raudio instead. I think we all would \\rchange the track, volume, or station \\rmore often than when we use the tip.\\r2. Pwrseats should be standard on an \\rentry-lux car like this.\\r3. The garage-door openers should \\rstill work even withOUT the key in the \\rignition.\\r4. The windshield washer tank had a \\rcrack in it and the car is barely 8 \\rmonths old.\\r These are just small quips, cuz this \\rcar still turns heads everytime i\\'m \\rdriving it and i can still keep up \\rwith most of the ppl in the street. Quattro. Love it and love my car. I bought this car after looking at a \\rnew 325, a used M3, and a Lexus IS300. \\r I\\'ve put 16,000 miles on this car and \\rthe only issues I\\'ve had came from the \\rcoil-pack problem that seemed to plague \\rsome of the 2002\\'s. Both times, the \\rdealer did whatever they could to get \\rthe car fixed.  \\r Besides that, this car has been a blast \\rto drive!  It looks and drives great! \\rThe 1.8T could use a little more low-\\rend power, but I love the great gas \\rmileage I get (avg. 29.5/mpg).\\r By far, the best car I\\'ve owned. I \\rwould like a little more power, but I \\rguess I\\'ll have to save up and place an \\rorder for the new S4. Awesome Vehicle This car looks great and drives even better. It has comfortable seats and the engine runs very smoothly. The A4 convertible is a cross between a sports car and a luxury car and it clearly has good features of both. While there is always room for improvement, I am very pleased with how it handles and the multitude of features. Pleased Overall Really pleased with my lease of this car after one year. Only one issue with a brake light sensor after 1 year of ownership and the dealer fixed it right away. Highway mileage is fantastic, but pure city driving gives poorer than I hoped. But overall, power and handling are the best! This is the funnest car I\\'ve ever driven. Trunk space the best of all convertibles I tested. Amazing Vehicle There are not enough superlatives to accurately describe this car.  Fit and finish are fantastic. It offers superior comfort (I\\'m 6\\'5\"), handles like a champ, provides surprising power from its strong 2.0 turbo and provides over 30+ highway MPG!  This is a very special automobile. A4 Avant is one of the ultimate NW vehicles This car will go anywhere, safely and comfortably. It is fun to drive, considering the cargo capacity. The 2.0T is a great combination of power and fuel economy (it\\'s no wonder that VW/Audi settled on it for just about every model for the last 10 years). On ramps: fun. Twisty mountain roads: fun. Race track: fun. Highway cruising: smooth and comfortable. Around town: perfect. Load up kids, dogs, luggage, groceries, everything. Bikes, skis, and boats on top no problem. Seriously, for active families who don\\'t want a big SUV, this is about as close to perfect as you can get. Kids who want to lower it and stuff some wide wheels on, no problem, you will get big scene points because it\\'s an avant. 2008 Audi A4 2.0T Avant I drove this A4 Avant for 18 months and could not wait for the day to finally unload this car. The car was in the repair shop 6 times in 18 months - all for engine issues - fuel sensor, oxygen sensor in turbo, and finally an oil leak. The dealership was courteous and professional each time I had the car in, but the problems kept popping up.  When the car was functioning properly, I enjoyed driving it. My main complaint was the automatic transmission - the Drive transmission setting shifted painfully slowly and enhanced the awful turbo lag. The Sport transmission setting was better, but it had to be shifted manually with the paddles into 6th gear when traveling < 80 mph. In 20 years of driving Honda and Toyota products, I made 3 trips in total for non-routine maintenance. 6 trips in 18 months for the Audi A4 is unacceptable and I will not buy another Audi. The little wagon that could I have had several Audi\\'s over the past 15 years as well as several Jeeps. This latest purchase with the 3.2 is outstanding. Power, all weather ability with utility and sport car manors. This package does it all. The MMI is great. Did a three hundred mile loop from New York to Boston and got 29 mpg. Got it with the Audi Certified program so great deal with new car warranty. Very, very happy. Stick to the Road This is my 3rd A4 Avant (1999; 2003; 2008). I recently had to retire my 1995 Alfa 164LS. I purchased this to drive along with our 2003 A4 Avant. The plan is to retire the 2003 and keep the 2008 once Alfa returns to the USA. The car is quite sporty in nature.  It appears as if the new A4 will have more driver right leg room, but it is unclear whether the new Avant will be offered as a 6 speed. We only have had manual transmissions with sport suspension. The 2008 2.0 engine is more throaty and powerful than previous models. The four wheel drive sticks like glue.  The 2.0 torque is limited, but the acceleration is fine, with little turbo lag. Forget BMW and go for it. This is an awesome SUV Alternative My other vehicles are 911 turbo, Mustang GT convertible, Cayenne S.  This vehicle has become my favorite. I can drive it over highway 17 in California with vigor. I drove it to Tahoe with the family, a roof box and a lot of gear. It was a blast.  It compensated well on icy patches and blasted through the snow. I can put my golden retriever in the back, pick up the family and still enjoy the ride. The S mode and paddle shifters make this a stealth sports car. I enjoy the \"S\" suspension features and the mileage of the 2.0T. It feels like a Porsche station wagon. I predict that these wagons will see a resurgence in the near future. The Avant gets 22 around town and 28 highway. A true sports wagon Looked for a wagon (not SUV) with some style and performance, settled on the A4 with 6-spd and am extremely happy so far. This car is as fun to drive as my 325i (and much more than my CLK430) and can carry stuff to boot. I have had no reliability issues after 3 weeks. I know this isn\\'t the final word, but no horror stories.  So far I get about 25 mpg around town (suburbs, not city) and more like 29 hwy, a little less if I feel like having fun.  It is not really a lightweight car so this seems acceptable.  Interior is very quiet and comfortable, my first 5-hour road trip flew by.  Can\\'t wait to see what quattro can do in the snow.  bad design high oil consumption, hesitates on acceleration, smokes, valves leak, faulty transmission control module and AC compressor issue. Sexy but elegant convertible  Great and comfortable car The car is fantastic, extremely fast, it only has two flaws.  One, in deep snow the car is too low so although it maintains excellent traction, snow builds up underneath so it can\\'t go through more than 8-10\" of snow.  Two, the back covers on fronts seats, glue gave out over time. 2008 Good commuter but definitely not a 3-series. Bought 2008 Audi A4 2.0T AWD with 29K miles to replace a 2003 3-series that was starting to nickle and dime me to death; the moonroof breaking and soggy floors (from the doors not moon roof)  was the last straw. Bottom line is I appreciate the A4, but it lacks the getup and go of the 3-series, granted the 325xi BMW was a 3.0L-5 speed manual.   I commute about 70 mi. per day mostly on the interstate, the A4 with sport suspension gives a decent ride and is extremely comfortable for a 35 minute commute with an aver. 24.7 MPG but it lags substantually off the line until you get to about 2500+ RPM, however, at hyway speeds it kicks into passing mode just fine and you\\'ll be going 90 before you know it.  I\\'ve driven it 6500 miles and haven\\'t had any maintenance issues yet however I\\'ve broken the latch to the storage area in the armrest and broke the hook that holds the sun visor. I\\'ve read these are common complaints; I don\\'t think I\\'ve been overly \\'hard\\' on it.   The A4 has been good for me by softening my somewhat agressive driving style. If your looking for a nice comfortable ride with some sportiness the A4 is right up your alley. Less Impressed Than I\\'d Hoped Purchased this car in 2014 after my 2006 A3 2.0T was totaled by a hit-and-run driver. The 2008 A4 had 28K miles from a warm-weather state and was a one-owner car from a vacation home - well cared for with full service records based on time, not mileage. I would have preferred Quattro, but the price and mileage were hard to beat. I should have listened to my instincts. Vastly different character than the A3... this A4 feels like a luxury car without any sporting pretense. The CVT transmission is horrendous - slow to respond in standard mode, jerky engagement from dead stop... in Sport mode, it holds RPMs far too long at low speeds before initially \"upshifting.\" Engine vibration is far more apparent than it should be for any luxury vehicle - the same engine in the A3 was less prone to vibration. Brakes on the A4 are less direct, more difficult to modulate and with longer pedal travel than the A3 - might be fixed with stainless steel brake lines. Steering is much lighter and less dynamic as well; same with the suspension which is calibrated for a compliant, soft ride over handling - lacking the balance of a BMW 3-series. Lastly, the climate control is noticeably less accurate than the A3... the interior temp seems to be about 5 degrees higher than the set point during all seasons. Might be a faulty part or just the nature of the system - hard to tell and not worth tearing apart the climate controls to find out. On the good side, the car is indeed comfortable as a highway cruiser. The interior materials are top notch. The trunk seriously swallows more cargo than my wife\\'s Ford Escape. Instruments are legible and direct. For the price paid, the car came well optioned for a 2008 model - although bewildering that certain features now standard on mid-level cars (like heated seats, Bluetooth and USB/AUX inputs) were nowhere to be found on my A4. It\\'s a handsome car that will serve as a good family hauler for a couple of years - a car that I wouldn\\'t be ashamed to take clients between point A and B. Lesson learned though - it\\'s not a driver\\'s car in the same way a 3-series might be. No major mechanical issues so far (knock on wood)... replaced post-purchase: an A/C diverter valve, the engine thermostat and the window lock switch. Not bad for a mid-2000s Audi. Overall, I\\'m not sure I would buy the A4 in this configuration again... at this price point for a used vehicle, there are more competent sport sedans and more reliable family sedans that cost less to operate. It\\'s all fun \\'n games, until catastrophe happens.. I have an \\'08 A4 Quattro 6MT Special Edition S-line. I bought it as a CPO car in 2011 with 36k miles. The car is absolutely sublime to drive in every way, even with the firm suspension. The first year I owned it, I put over 25k miles commuting 100mi each way for work, across a mountain range. The traction control and AWD have literally saved my life twice hitting black ice on a bend in the highway. Very little issues with the car; cruise control module went out, covered under warranty; ignition switch died last year out of warranty, $160 total (cheap). Then one day, accelerating onto the interstate, the engine shut down leaving me just enough momentum to coast over to the shoulder (on a massive bridge, no less). After having it inspected and diagnosed at the dealer, it turns out a high pressure fuel pump exploded, literally. It blew metal shrapnel into the engine destroying the block and fuel system. A piece(s) of shrapnel severed the intake cam chain, seizing the cam and destroying most of the remainder of the engine. The engine is damaged beyond repair and has to be replaced, to the tune of over $7500! Audi has generously offered to cover 25% up front, but I am currently working with Audi of America to see if they can extend that courtesy a bit more. At this point, I haven\\'t decide if I\\'m going to keep the car after all this or just dump it. Either way, I\\'m out as much as $6k on a car only worth $11k...If you want a car that is nearly perfect to drive, this is the one. Specifically the 2008 owing to it\\'s having the new AWD system (which is MUCH better than the old Haldex system). That said, I\\'d have some kind of extended warranty, service agreement, and/or a whopping fistful of expendable greenbacks. Great car (while in warranty) I purchased this car used with about 1 year left on the original warranty. I had a couple minor problems, but Audi\\'s service is fantastic. However, after the warranty ended I began experiencing problems every 3-4 months. These included spark plugs going bad, problems with water getting into the intake, the fuel pump going bad, problems with the brake light switch, and more. These also included my car being stuck in the shop for multiple days very long costly repairs. Overall, the car is fun to drive, but be prepared for a lot of costly repairs down the road. Loved it while I had it Not as nice looking as the new A4s.Not as nice looking as my old 2004 A4.At 50K-something miles the seat belt wouldn\\'t retract.The car had miles but the car was only 2 years old.Audi refused to warranty the seat belt mechanism and wanted me to pay 800 to fix it.I escalated it to Audi of America and they said the dealer would agree to 5% off!Lots of little things with the car were wrong at what should be very low mileage.I refused and traded the car in.I really loved Audi but ultimately they spent their own customer.Would not buy another Audi unless they can prove building a deeper relationship with their quality and my satisfaction. Great Car Purchased new in May of 2008.Audicare was included so I was covered for all scheduled maintence and unscheduled repairs.I\\'m now at 40,000 miles and other that my oil changes, my only service was for a rattle in the door.They found a plastic piece that came loose.That is it!! 40,000 miles of pure enjoyment.I routinely get over 30 mpg, it handles great in the snow and it is fun to drive when the roads are dry.The back seat is a little crampedand not very comfortable to sit in.Then again, with grown children, I don\\'t often have someone in the back. I do wish that I had opted for the premium sound system.I will probably trade it in for the new A4. Looking forward to the lease to end I lease my cars for 3 years for multiple reasons.  The most important reason is because I want a dependable car that\\'s not going to break down and is under warranty. I\\'ve been towed twice since I got this car new in April of 2008.  The first time was when a fuel sensor failed. I was stranded at a stop sign.  Audi\\'s roadside assistance was so bad that I had to join AAA to have my car towed.  I was  told me there was a recall going out on the fuel sensor. With 30m miles on the car the car stopped moving forward or backward at an intersection.  I couldn\\'t put the car in any gear other the gear it was in. To Audi\\'s praise Audi\\'s roadside assistance was great.  Repair: a bolt had fallen off.  Love it so far. Bought it CPO 3 months, 2K miles ago and love it. No issues so far-knock on wood. Very fun to drive w/ 6-sp manual. Interior is luxurious.. Armrest is a bit awkward-it covers the parking brake. I\\'ve cracked my elbow on it several times when it\\'s lifted up. Armrest lid latch broke-this is a common problem. Dealer replaced under warranty.   Overall, lot of fun to drive. Before buying, I drove two G35\\'s and three 328i\\'s, and don\\'t regret for a second going with the Audi. The Infinity and BMW had much more power, but A4 was just more fun to drive. G35 had too much plastic in the cockpit. BMW oddly enough felt too refined - like it was driving and I was along for the ride.  So Far So Fun Bought as an Audi certified used car - 4 years of bumper to bumper warranty.  The car is a joy to drive, the S-line suspension is tight and grips the road with the all-wheel drive.  I use the paddle shifters to kick up the turbo and hit the gas - its a fun little 4 cylinder!  Doesn\\'t have the low end torque, but it does get 24 miles to the gallon in the city and 30 on the highway! No issues with oil or anything else other reviews have stated (knock on wood).  The interior is very comfortable and stylish - it is pretty cramped, though, in the back seat.  Trunk has lots of room.  Almost every time I drive it some stranger gives a turn and a compliment! Go buy a BMW 3 Series I trade cars about every 2 years and have owned BMW, Acura, Honda, Cadillac, Mazda, Jeep, Volkswagon, Lincoln and I\\'m sure I\\'m forgetting some others.  This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned.  I opted for the sport suspension and it literally feels like you are driving a covered wagon.  There is a spot on my way home from work where I literally brace myself for the impact...and it\\'s not a big bump.  This is the only car I have owned in my life that I have to buy a quart of oil to add to it in between oil changes.  At any given time I would have anywhere from 1 to 3 warning lights on at the same time.  I just traded it in last night for an Acura TL and was thrilled to say goodbye! Oil Consumption Machine This is an excellent car except for the amount of oil it consumes.  1 quart every 1,200 miles is too high.  If you purchase this car be prepared to have your trunk full of oil quarts. Other than that it is a good car. Fun & Then Some I bought this car used a few months ago and have loved it since I got into it. Overall the performance is good and the turbo is great compared to many I have driven in the past - very smooth.  Fuel economy is good if you lay off the accelerator, you can easily get 35-40mpg with good driving and 20-25mpg being more aggressive.  Also, the car is for lack of a better word spunky.  The styling will get you looks and the car loves a winding road.  Hitting the accelerator on a hard curve is pure joy.  Overall great car with a solid foundation.   Don\\'t recommend Audi The car don\\'t last. I have a 2008 A4, and the engine is terrible.  I have had it in service 3 times and it\\'s there again.  They don\\'t know how to fix it. Best car I\\'ve owned After driving BMWs,Cadillac, Porsche, Infinity; I test drove the A4 after seeing a 329/month lease in the paper.  After my first test drive I was sold. Since buying, I like the car more each day.Audi engineers are brilliant.Car handles like it\\'s on rails,the AWD is incredible, the paddle shifters fun, driving in sport mode is a blast.It\\'s very easy to get the speed governor to engage around 130.  After slight turbo lag off the jump(which I improved by putting in a K&N air filter and using 93 octane fuel), once the engine has enough air compression, the turbo blasts the car forward.  Interior compenents are all high quality.Leather seating surfaces are top notch. Wife also likes it a lot! Very happy Purchased this as a cert pre owned for a great price.  Had only 10000 miles on it and jumped on it.  Very enjoyable to drive and love the comfort of the seats. Was looking at G35 also but for the money the Audi I thought was a better car.   Fun and Classy This is my first Audi. I was driving a 6 cyl. VW Passat before this and had never owned a 4 cyl. car, so I was a little nervous about getting the 2.0T. I am pleasantly surprised with this motor. Although there is a little lag pulling out into traffic now and then, I can\\'t complain. Fit and finish are superb and I love the way it looks. I leased in July 2008, so I can\\'t wait to see what 2011 has to offer.   Going Strong I leased this A4 last May and it continues to get better. This is my first Audi and it will not be my last. I have had a great experience with Momentum Audi in Houston and have had no troubles with the vehicle at all. I\\'m getting amazing gas mileage, up to 26 in city and usually 32/33 on highway.   Especially nice for a small lux sedan Purchased w/8000 miles. Went from 2001 Maxima. Car is great. No complaints. Very cozy and quick. So much electronics that I get lost in the car (a good thing). Gas mileage is terrific, about 23 overall. Got 36 on a 400 mile highway trip. Wheels are a little hard to keep clean of brake dust. Never drove a car so perfect. Great Car This is a great car to drive, highway drive is very good on gas.  The car has great pickup going in to traffic.  I would buy another the car handles well. Love It I bought this car about 5 months ago and it\\'s awesome! The only things I don\\'t like about it are the cup holders under the arm rest and the slight lag out the gate. The lag is random. It\\'s weird, but it depends on the day. The engine is definitely affected by extreme temperatures.  The 3.2 makes the A4 special We looked high and low to find an A4 equipped with the 3.2 six and the manual gearbox. We decided to factory order one and discovered that production had already halted to make room for the \\'09 (B8) model. That one wasn\\'t available with the six-speed manual so it looked like the less intersting 328Xi was going to get the nod when the dealer found a car equipped like we wanted (basicly, equipped with everything) in Riverside California. I was going to be there on business, and I arrainged to pick the car up there and my wife (it\\'s her car) drove it back to Tulsa. She and I love the car.  From the GPS nav to the smooth shifting six- speed, it\\'s a sedan that puts a smile on your face.  Burns oil My 2008 Audi A4 Quattro burns oil at a rate of 1 quart per 1000 miles. The oil level warning came on at 6000, 10000 and 14000 miles. Each time I had it checked at the dealer where it was purchased and was told each time that no leaks were found and that it was operating normally. They also measured the aforementioned burn off rate according Audi guidelines and informed me that it was \"well within Audi specifications and no action is required.\" These engines are problematic and Audi knows it.  It won me over! I started out gunning for a Saturn VUE. But it does not come with a moon roof so I tried on the Audi A4 quatro for size - performance - finish. It does not disappoint. My first reaction to driving it: A little noisy. Initially reminded me of a diesel - albeit a fairly quiet one. The noise level is most noticeable when first accelerating. Once under way the noise level recedes and is forgotten. Finish & performance wins raves. Safety features - brakes - road stability - guages placement underscore diligent design engineering. This car gives you the feeling it was designed by engineers who like driving cars. Cars that envelope you in comfort; safety. Road stability is totally reassuring. 2008 Audi A4 S-Line tip-tonic  I am an america living in Germany and have really been able to push this car to its limits. For a four cylinder this car moves, There is a significant lag in the turbo when not in the \"S\" setting (S-lines) At 140 miles an hour for 40 miles I averaged about 19 MPG and same road at 70MPH 33.6 MPG. Great car but can do so much better I bought this car in brilliant black with black leather interior, after researching and test driving cars from the famous five (BMW (1 and 3 series), Infinity G37, Lexus IS, Acura TL). In terms of exterior looks and interior quality and design, Audi beats all the others hand down. I have always had a soft corner for Audi when compared to BMW (a personality trait of always siding with the underdogs). This car has however met and exceeded my expectations in nearly every department.  It drives and handles like a charm in all driving conditions. There are however, a few issues that I had hoped would be resolved in the 2009 model but they remain largely unaddressed. They are discussed below Glad I bought a 2008 This is my first car in 15 years - live in NYC. I have the manual A4, titanium, iPod, Bluetooth. The car has been a blast to drive - although 4th sounds like it should be 6th! The car moves perfectly and the finish is just as every review indicated - nothing I would change about the interior. I have been averaging about 27mpg the first month - not bad considering Manhattan traffic. I am really glad I bought the 2008 as the 2009 looks far too much like a BMW. As for reviews about it being a bit slow out the gate, I\\'m not seeing it and am sure it is not worth the MPG trade off to have purchased the larger engine. Love my A4 Our experience with the A4 has been great my wife loves it. Very economical with gas. As the first time owning an Audi I was not totally sold the first time I drove the car. I immediately noticed the jerk (as if I was driving a stick shift vehicle) I was told it was the SVT in the vehicles transmission. I only different from our Acura TL and former Lexus model was the oil light came on at 4K miles because shortness of oil. The car ate the oil as if it were candy. Audi told us the vehicle does that within the first couple of 1000\\'s miles. Very small car with great fuel economy joined with a sexy exterior look. What people should expect The Audi A4 a compact car with plenty of room for the front seat users.  It is not intended for 5 passengers. The 2.0 liter is very strong for a 4 cylinder so you need to keep in mind it can\\'t be compared to a 6. Interior is very well built. Exterior is very sharp. This car has all the power anyone should need. If you ease up on the pedal it will get very good gas mileage as I have experienced 29 miles per gallon so far. You can get a larger car if you pay 15 to 20 grand more, or you can wait for the 2009 model that will be larger. This car compares to all its competitors and is better in some ways than 328Ix, C class, G35X. A blast to drive I have had this car for two weeks now and so far I am very pleased with the performance. I love the way car handles yet maintains a decent fuel economy. It makes me go look for some curvy roads. Strongly suggest this car if you enjoy the driving. Great car so far Have had this for just over 2 weeks and 800 miles and so far I\\'m very pleased.  I do wish the 2.0T had more power but I knew going into it that it was a trade-off for better fuel economy.  Setting aside the lack of power at the low end, I love the way the car drives and handles.  Been in one early spring snowstorm so far and it held the road beautifully.  Quartz Gray color is stunning. A Beast The car is just gorgeous, and a blast to drive.  Went for the throaty 3.2 over the 2.0, and I\\'m glad I did.  Not only for the engine, but also for the equipment that\\'s standard instead of optional.  It\\'s fast and handles like a dream.  I actually want more snow.  A4 lemon? Had the car for 5 weeks  and loved every minute. Hit 2115 miles, oil pressure light came on and car died. Threw a cam, needs entire engine rebuilt, possibly major design flaw with 08\\'s. 4 weeks for repairs so far, and I still don\\'t have it back.  I\\'m trying to get Audi to get me into a brand new replacement vehicle, but they aren\\'t budging ( they just want to fix it). I didn\\'t pay a premium for a rebuilt car. So much for Audi quality Sweeet  My first Audi (drove a 1.8T jetta for 5 years); this is one sweet ride.  Gone is the turbo lag I had in Jetta, probably due to the Audi manual transmission.  Nice smooth shifting, very good acceleration, fuel mileage has been in upper 20s, but car only has 2000 miles on it.  The appearance of the grille is very sporty and somewhat mean looking :).  I got basic car with 17\" wheels, leather, bluetooth and iPod.  The interior is beautiful and very comfortable.  The ride is smooth and does this car love curves! Overall, the cost of this car is very reasonable.  Overall, very pleased at this point.  Highly recommend anyone taking a look. Jetta with the name Audi on the grille I have an \\'04 Jetta and i\\'m completely unhappy with it, probably because I have owned volvos before. I have had this car for about 4 days now and when I get into the car, I feel like I am in the Jetta. The console is still small, with the small cup holders underneath, the ignition jingle never stops until both the driver and passenger have thier sealt belts on, and just all the little things about the Jetta are in A4 that would make you skeptical to pay $41,000 for it. The turbo charger has a delay when u push on the accelerator. I do have to say though, that the seats are comfortable and the styling outside is excellent. The car I always wanted It\\'s indeed a dream car.  The design is excellent, top execution and materials. Everything is balanced with very good taste. The danger in this price range is sending the message that you bought the car to show-off. On the contrary, A4 shows that you have a fine taste of spending your money (let\\'s admit it, it\\'s not a cheap car and everybody sees that).  The 2.0T has only 200HP but is really powerfull provided that you now how to drive a 4 cyl Turbo engine, i.e., buy a manual transmission and do not ask the engine for maximum thrust at 1500rpm. Downshift, step on the gas and see what a Turbo engine can do.  For me, A4 is the ideal compromise between price, aspect and driving experience.  Get the S-Line This is my third Audi, and by far my favorite. I enjoy the throatiness of the turbo and think that the new 2.0 is one of the ten best engines in the world. I confess to dropping quattro this time both to improve fuel economy and to free up enough $ to spring for the S-Line. Sure all new 2008 sedans have S-line styling on the body, but not the 18\" wheels, sport suspension, and superb interior trim. My advice is to spring for it, as you hardly ever see the 18\" wheels on A4 and it enhances the look tremendously. I am delighted, too, with the granite gray color which shifts with the changing light and weather... always a pleasure to come across it anew. Great Ride We have only had the car for a month, but we are loving it so far.  The ride is very comfortable and quiet, yet the vehicle holds the road extremely well. The styling of the car is beautiful inside and out. Damn good car I\\'ve looked at everything - BMW, Acura, MB, Lexus, etc - finally settled on the Audi and haven\\'t regretted it since. The car is a pleasure to drive and it\\'s obvious that someone put some thought into building this monster. Fun to drive, beautiful inside and out - can\\'t get enough. I didn\\'t go with any of the \"extra\" options - they\\'re a bit pricey and don\\'t really add much to the experience. I think you can figure out when to turn on the lights and wipers. Great Car So Far I\\'ve only had it for 3 days, but I love it so far.  Good performance for the engine size and handles great.  I was torn between getting a pure sports car or pure luxury car, but the A4 has enough of both to please me.  The Sport setting on the auto transmission is great for playing around, but sucks the gas too much for day to day driving.  I also can\\'t wait for some snow to test the AWD out. Can You Say Slot Car? Just picked up a new 08 A4 2.0T Quattro with Sport Suspension. (Previously drove an 06 A4 CVT front wheel drive.)  After driving the front wheel drive Audi for 2 years (and really liking the way it handled), I was amazed with the Quattro\\'s road handling prowess! On the way home from the dealer, I was on the freeway and naturally fiddling with the stereo adjustments and didn\\'t notice that I was approaching a sharp curve to the left while making a transition from one highway to another. I entered the corner at about 65 (40 advised) and started to go for the brake, but as I turned the wheel, the car simply took the corner like it was on a rail.  I kid you not!  So far... I just picked up my new Audi A4 quattro 2.0T and can\\'t get over this car.  I\\'ve only had it a week, but I\\'ve been entirely impressed thus far.  The feel and ride are just great, solid and smooth.  Handling is sure and secure.  I owned a 2001 VW Jetta GLX previously and was a little unsure of going back to a four cylinder, but the power of the 2.0T feels even better than the V6 in the Jetta.  I was also concerned about engine noise and gas mileage.  The growl of the Audi exhaust makes me smile and I\\'m getting about the same in mileage as I was in the Jetta - made the switch back to a 4 cylinder worth it.  I got the Audi loaded up with extras. 2008 Audi A4 2.0T CVT The car can be summed up in one phrase: performance and luxury in a compact design. I drove a 2003 and 2005 3.0L A4 prior to getting this one and the performance stands up well. There is definitely noticeable turbo lag, but this can probably be overcome by changing driving habits. The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit \"throatier\" than I\\'m used to. The car handles extremely well, though, hugging curves and accelerating very smoothly. The now-standard S-Line exterior features definitely give the car a sportier look. The interior is outstanding. The layout is getting better and the list of available features is exhaustive. In all, a great car! I really wanted to love this car... ...but I would tell anyone considering an Audi that you should be prepared to spend a good amount of money on maintenance.  I purchased this car used with 47,000 on it.  The first month I had the car I accidently leaned on the lid for the center console storage.  The cheap plastic hinge snapped off and Audi wants $280 for a replacement.  The tire sensors\\' battery went dead and you cannot replace the battery...I think the Audi sensor was $125 (?).  I went with a generic at the tire dealer for less than half that. My air conditioning compressor failed at the beginning of the summer.  A replacement is available online for around $300, but in order to get to it you literally have to take the front of the car off and support the engine with a jack.  Most mechanics understandably want $1,300-$1,500 for that one.  At the moment, I have an error code that indicates my high-pressure fuel pump is failing.  It is a too common problem with these 2.0 Turbo engines that may be related to a cam follower on the pump.   The story is that during a great demand for these cars a few years ago Audi contracted a new supplier to make these parts, which were made of sub-standard metal.  In extreme cases, these parts disintegrate and the metal shavings can cause catostrophic engine failure.  Audi is resisting  the making a general recall.  When everything is working well with this car, it is a joy to drive.  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t been feeling the farfegneugan (sp?) very often lately.  My general impression is that the car is fussy and over-engineered. Love my Cabriolet! It\\'s it made for a single person! Better than A5 Cab I have owned a 2009 A4 Cabriolet for about a year now and let me tell you the experience has been great! I wanted a convertible that was TRULY a year round vehicle, and this car definitely fit the bill. I looked at the BMW 3 series, Volvo C70 and Volkswagen Eos prior to purchasing this A4 and I am very happy with my decision. The 3 series is RWD which did not give me a good sense of security when driving in the snow. The others (Volvo and VW) just did not have the aesthetics I was looking for. The A4 cab is just a beautiful car, and handles well in all types of weather conditions. The Audi A5 cab is also a very nice car, but for the price it does not make sense to purchase one. Fantastic Car! I have the Audi for six months now.  I have grown to enjoy it more the longer I\\'ve driven it.  It is comfortable, zippy (especially in manual mode), quiet (even with the top down with the wind screen installed), and a blast to drive!  This has become my favorite car I\\'ve owned/leased, slightly nudging out the Honda S2000.  The S2000 was much more fun to drive, but the added convenience of a full sized trunk, and back seat in the Audi, plus the fun to drive factor, have it beat.  I recommend this vehicle (or its replacement the A5, which I can\\'t wait to get!) without reservation.  There are great deals on any A4\\'s left in stock, since this is the last year. Go get one and start having fun! Love the new A4 I traded in my 2002 A4 3.0 Quattro on a lease on a 2009 A4 2.0 Quattro.  This 2.0 has plenty of torque.  Cannot tell the difference with the new V4 from my prior V6, except the gas mileage is better and it is a quieter engine. I ordered the Premium Plus package with the navigator.  I love the voice activated bluetooth dialing, the voice activated navigation, etc., and the backup camera with guidance. Audi came up with a winner.  I am getting over 33 miles per gallon on the highway and around 28 in the city/suburbs. I am very happy with the vehicle.  I loved my 2002; but, this is a big improvement. Only thing I miss from the 2002 is the storage compartments under the front seats. A Very Appealing Car We get many compliments on our S-Line Cab.  Great looking S4 wheels.  This is our first convertible and we love top down driving.  The Cab is  fun to drive but not BMW thrilling.  Like the fact its an AWD car, for full year use.  Fit and finish is excellent, interior is gorgeous.  Gas mileage is terrible.  Hope long term reliability is good.  We leased, but buyout is very attractive.  If it holds together, can envision a long term ownership. Great Car Minor quirks  Car is everything I expected. Fit & Finish is as good as it gets. So good in fact that the seams trunk to body are so tight you can\\'t fit bike rack clips in between. Engine is smooth. Test drove the 2.0s not going to pay this much for a car that vibrates 3.2 is for me. Brakes are awesome. Keep your eye on the rear view in a panic stop. Tiptronic is fun. Quirks...  The ipod interface is poor, I leave my keys in the car in the garage but not with this... the lights will not turn off, the homelink does not work until you turn the car on. Kinda dumb that you start the car before you open the garage door.  Audi A4 Cabriolet This car was leased for my wife.  I owned a TT with a manual transmission a few years ago and we were attracted to this car by the excellent lease terms, appearance and the previous experience with Audi.  The A4 has been back to the dealer twice in 3 weeks.  The first time was due to wind noise and a water leak in the space between the front and rear driver\\'s window.  That was fixed.  The second trip was because the automatic transmission (CVT) feels like it shifts from 1st to overdrive within about 2 seconds, causing significant loss of power.  This even happens in sport mode.  In addition, there is some lurching and hesitation upon initial acceleration.  The dealer says this is \"normal\". Worst Car Ever Please Test Drive this car extensively. Dealer will NOT tell you that the car goes forward when you put car in reverse. They say this is normal for cvt transmission. This was not disclosed before purchase. I don\\'t think they would ever sell any cars with cvt if this was disclosed. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR. This is my 2nd Audi.. ...A4, previously owned 2007 2.0T Q sport/Sline/Ti. Current car (2.0TQ prem+ w/sport pkg) is what I was hoping for when I 1st purchased an Audi, slightly better performance than before, much better handling, much improved seats (highly recommend sport pkg option). Feels like an adult\\'s vehicle. Complaints: only re plastic dash piece (hope for aftermarket cure soon) & wish it still had a full size spare - minor stuff really. Very anxious to see how this is chipped, 2007 was a big difference, 2009 promises to be better. Bottom line, I love driving this car... so does my wife. Love It I bought this car as a gift for my wife, a blue quattro convertible. For once I hit an out of the park home run. She loves this car and I do too. Its fun to drive, beautiful on the inside and outside, and gives us no trouble at all.  Best Car EVER! In January I traded in my 2006 BMW 530i in for the 2009 Audi A4. It seems like it should compete with the 5, because of its roominess and standard features. This car is the perfect size and it\\'s more fun to drive than my BMW. Great value.  I love my Audi! Audi stands behind their Product!!! Forever a Fan! Audi has my loyalty as a solid and ethical car company!  And Boulder Audi (formerly Stammler) is the most amazing dealership I have ever encountered.  First, my Audi A4 Avant wagon was my FAVORITE car ever..however, at 62,000 miles I was experiencing excessive oil consumption.  I brought my car to the service department, and they replaced my engine at no cost to me.  Unfortunately, and just over  20,000 miles later, I experienced a second engine failure, stranded in Flagstaff AZ on a road trip.   I contacted Audi of America and the original dealership in Boulder where I bought the car.   I also contacted Michael, my sales advisor at Boulder Audi/Stammler where I originally purchased the car.  He was entirely sympathetic, helpful, and professional and forwarded my case to the Regional Rep for Audi.   I doubted, however, that I would get any assistance from Audi, but I was only hoping that maybe they would stand behind their product.  I am delighted to report that Audi America has agreed to replace my second engine at no cost to me after I presented my cars service history to them.  It is surprising when a large company actually steps up and does the honorable thing.   I am amazed but so encouraged by their business ethics!  Audi/Volkswagen Porsche have my total loyalty in the way this was handled, and how they stand behind their product.   I have always loved the way the car handled, but now, more importantly, I am so impressed by the business ethics of the company who stands behind their product. HORRIBLE CAR MECHANICALLY I just bought this car 4 months ago and it has 60,000 miles on it.It is burning oil like you wouldn\\'t believe.I took it in to the Audi service department and they said the first step is to replace the crankcase pressure regulatory valve and put the Audi software update on it, which cost $109 for that.Overall, the cost is $600.If this doesn\\'t fix the problem, the engine pistons need to be replaced, so basically a new engine for $5,000.Audi needs to recall the 2.0 liter engines.Why would you charge 40,000 for a car and the engine goes out at 60,000 miles. Obviously, this is a faulty engine! Meh Quite frankly, it\\'s hard to be ambivalent about $40k purchase, but I have to be honest with myself, and 9 months after purchasing this car, I can\\'t say it\\'s changed our lives.  It\\'s solidly built, but there\\'s a fair amount of road noise.  For all the self- congratulation from Audi about the increase in size, it\\'s really not all that roomy.  I think my wife\\'s old 2001 Jetta had more room in the back.  The MMI might be good compared to options from other manufacturers, but it\\'s hardly intuitive.  In sum, it\\'s a solid but not outstanding effort. Noisy Brakes! I love my new Audi A 4 Avant Wagon but very concerned about the noise the brakes make. It sounds like a loud creaking noise each time I apply the brakes regardless of whether the brakes are cold or warm. There is an abnormal amount of brake dust,as well. The Audi dealership tells me that this noise is \"normal\" and to help quiet the noise, I should slam on the brakes (in an empty parking lot) to \"reset\" them. I actually did this to no avail. This seems silly and hard to accept for a new 42K car. Also the GPS is extremely difficult to use - very complicated. Seats are not very comfortable after the first 2 hours. Other than these few issues the vehicle performs and drives very nicely.  It\\'s a sport wagon not a station wagon! I test drove the BMW 328i wagon, Saab 9-3 Combi, Prius, Audi A3, Subaru Impreza, VW GTI, Volvo V50 and the Mazda 3. The A4 Avant had the luxury, speed, room, look, and quality of materials I was looking for. I took my first maiden road trip and could not be happier. No body aches, great gas mileage, great handling in rain and when the sun came out I opened up the panoramic sun roof. Joyful ride This is my 2nd Audi to replace my 2002 A6 2.7T. I like the look of the A4 so chose the Avant version for practical reasons. I must say that it\\'s such a joy to drive this car everyday that the commute to and from work seems almost tolerable. It feels sporty even without the sports package. Even though the sports package moves it further up the performance ladder, the ride is a little too jarring for the road I drive on. An added bonus on this car is fuel frugality. I am already averaging 25.5 MPG over 1,300 miles (1/5 city and 4/5 highway driving).   Much better than BMW, Infinity, Acura My trade was a 2006 A3 sport that I had for 2.5 years.  I liked it so much I wanted to see what else Audi had that was just a little bit larger, more comfortable yet just as much fun to drive.  The A4 Avant Sport was it.  Options I got: Premium Plus, Sport, Navigation, Rear Side Airbags.  This car is unbelievable.  The BMW 325xi wagon cost $8k more for the same equipment but had a cheaper interior and didn\\'t drive as well.  The Infiniti EX had sub-par interior quality although it drove great.  However, I\\'m not going to apologize to my back seat passengers as they trip getting out of the car (small back seat and door opening if I\\'m buying a $44k car and I would have to do that with the EX). One of the best wagons available I swapped a Tundra pickup for this wagon and love the car. Best combination of size, performance, and practicality on the market. Wonderful handling and when the turbo kicks in, breathtaking acceleration. Lots of features and techno gadgets even in the base model. As can be expected from Audi, top notch interior build although the gray metallic plastic around the instrument panel seems cheesy, why didn\\'t they just use the aluminum trim like in the rest of the car. The radio controls take some getting used to and the steering wheel audio controls frustratingly don\\'t let you scroll among preset stations only. This car is a looker and gets lots of attention, a top choice among wagons! Fantastic car!! I just bought the \\'09 A4 Avant with Prestige package, Navigation, 19\" Sports package and Drive Select. After about 1200 miles I must say that this is by far the best and most fun car I ever owned. The technology is cutting edge, the interior is on par with any recent Porsche (and much better than its direct competitors) and the performance is much better than the previous generation A4. The new A4 has dethroned the BMW as the true ultimate driving machine. As a previous A4 owner, I am pleased that Audi addressed all design flaws from the B7 models. It now boosts stronger hinges on arm rests, cup holders closer to the center of gravity etc Bang for the buck! Great car for the money. Just bought this car for my wife, looked at BMW X6 - seats only 4? 3 series SUV I wasn\\'t impressed with, I drive a 335i and we needed a winter car. Front end, very aggressive styling and they did a better job with the back end too. Enough for 5 people, dogs and luggage. A Real Advance I have owned various BMW\\'s & Audi\\'s over the past 15 years, and this seems to be one of my favorites. I just ended an X3 lease and was considering the 328xi wagon or the A4 Avant.  To my surprise, I chose the Avant with the Premium Plus Package, because they really made a lot of advancements since my 2004 Audi. Until BMW redesigns the 328, the Audi 2.0 I think is a much better car. It handles great, it\\'s feels much quicker than the 328, and the interior and exterior design (at least on the Avant) is a real winner. So far, I think it\\'s a no brainer. Done With Audi - Got me a Honda Way too much trouble than it is worth.  Love the look, but money guzzler. Get rid of it as soon as the warranty expires; I kept mine way  too long.  The Final straw, Took to the Audi Dealer in Raleigh for a  360-degree service, they charged me an over $1,300. After a few day, check engine light, and check light bulb came on.   (some sensor is always going bad)  dealers charged me another $160 for the diagnostic test and told me I needed to pay another $550 for some part, and it could be more depending if they find any other problem.  When I had a warranty, I was at the dealer REGULARLY!  Should have let it go after the warranty expired. I traded the 2009 Audi A4 for a 2018 Honda Accord Touring and is extremely happy.  Reliability and peace of mind at last. Love, Hate Relationship Loved my Audi, but hated when it started acting up. \"Awww Bwoy! What does this light means now?\" I love it when it works.... ...but it breaks down too much. Blown turbo. Rear differential broke -- which destroyed the transmission. Random little issues. And then recently the oil pressure dropped, which means the engine is now toast. I bought it used with like 47K miles in 2012. Have had something wrong with the car almost every other year. And now at 108K miles it needs a new motor. That seems like a premature death.  So while I love driving it when it works (great handling, good acceleration, sport mode is nice, very comfy inside), I can\\'t handle the fact that I\\'ve put in almost as much in repairs as I spent on the car in 2012. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be getting into another Audi soon. Disappointed motor mounts gone bad at 38,000 miles. 47,000 Miles I bought the Audi A4 2.0T Premium 4 door sedan from my best friend (30 plus years) and his wife in April 2015 with 38,000 miles. I was extremely happy with the car - especially the acceleration and road handling. The first week of August 2016, with 47,000 miles on the car - the check engine light goes on and some unholy sounds begin emitting from the engine block. After two mechanics, I was directed to bring the car back to the dealer. After a day and a half, the verdict - motor and turbo are done. The dealer informed me that the motor/turbo parts were a mere $14,000! If I wanted to trade the car in, they would give me $500. Currently, the car is in a mechanic\\'s shop in Brooklyn - it looks like the repairs, parts, labor will be around $11,000. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I had a Toyota Camry for 15 years and never once had to make a repair of that cost and magnitude. Or maybe I would be better off with a Hyundai.February 2017: Ended up paying $12,700 for a new motor, turbo and alternator from my friends mechanic in Brooklyn. Had contacted Audi and a personal service representative informed me that they would only pick up the costs if I had the car repaired at an Audi dealer. Spoke to a Vice President of Audi who directed me to their service website. I filled out a long, detailed questionnaire and NEVER received a response. My 2009 Audi A4 Turbo is running better than it did before these repairs. I have every intention of using the car through the end of the NY winter and then trading it in for a Lexus, Acura, or a Volvo. I\\'ve spoken with many mechanics who have agreed that it is near impossible for them to work on an Audi. Obviously, I will tell anyone to avoid the 2009 Audi A4 and the whole line of vehicles. The Audi representatives exhibited complete indifference to my problems with a 2009 line of vehicles that had a detailed history of inferior manufacturing problems.Additional: I traded in the Audi A4 for a pre owned 2014 Lexus GS350 AWD during March of 2017 that had 24,000 miles. I am extremely happy with the performance of the Lexus and the service received from the dealer - Ray Catena Lexus of White Plains. One final telling indication regarding the 2009 Audi A4 Turbo- it routinely appears as a Used Car to avoid in Consumer Reports annual car ratings. I\\'m aware that Audi manufactures several high quality vehicles but would not recommend an Audi based on my experience with the vehicle I owned. I will wholeheartedly recommend a Lexus & have two friends who have purchased or leased a Lexus based on their experience with my GS 350. This car only problems Bought this this car at 87k mileage, in one month I drove the car only 6 days then the rest of the time the car was at the dealer for repairs burning 1quarter high expensive oil every 300 miles they said the turbo needed to be replace cost 1800$.Stay away from this car Good car if you enjoy seeing the dealer at lot I owned an Audi A4 convertible for 55,000 miles.  During that time, I broke down twice (once less than ten miles after having maintenance at a dealership).   The check engine light illuminated on a regular basis.  Although the performance and handling are good, the lack of reliability overshadowed everything else.  The level of reliability is what one would expect from a 1970s era British car, German luxury car. 2009 audi a4 quattro I don\\'t recommend this car to anyone. When the car is running it is great, but that isn\\'t the case a lot of the time. I bought used certified pre-owned at 40,000 miles and traded it in at 130,000 miles. The car had everything go wrong from a blown up engine to a parasitic battery drain that killed my battery. A lot was covered under the factor warranty, but after 100,000 miles if anything goes wrong it is a bare minimum of a $1000. Repeat do not recommend. Great car but not reliable. In three years of owning a CPO Audi A4, I have had seven trips to the dealership with the check engine light.  On four separate occasions, I have had to return to a dealership after a repair when the repair was not properly completed.  It is a great car, but the reliability issue overshadows other issues. excessive oil consumption and many other problems DO NOT BUY THIS CAR AT ALL !!! BUYER BEWARE !!!We first leased and bought a 2009 A4 car and it uses oil extensively.  It did not even pass its first smog check and now the car is considered a total loss.The Audi dealer  said that it will cost $14,000 to replace the WHOLE engine. We have tried many cars from the past from BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus and this is the worst car in our lives!!!I just read the class action lawsuit on this car extensive oil usage ... it is outrageous and we brought in the dealer twice and they did not warn us.I hope Audi this review and rectify their problem.  This is unacceptable!!! AUDI A4 ....What a dissapointment!! Do your research!!! I purchased this used 2009 A4 Quattro with 72k miles, the car is very appealing and looks very nice which is what my wife liked about it. I thought I got a really good deal on the car, but now I know why the dealer basically gave it away and didn\\'t push for that extended warranty. This car is by far the worse car I\\'ve ever had on maintenance issues. The oil consumption is just ridiculous and just started ticking very loud...I have a 3 series BMW and absolutely love it. I\\'m going to be trading the Audi in soon for another BMW and be done with this car. I jumped in this car without doing my research and paid for it. There are complaints about this oil issue every where and the dealership will not help unless your under warranty. Even under warranty it will be a hassle, don\\'t make the same mistake! Update 04/19/2017... car melted cylinder 4 valves out of no where..3k in repairs...wtf audi!!!! Save some money and buy a Jetta I have owned more cars than I can count. The Audi A4 was hands down the worst car I have ever owned. I bought the car with 40,000 miles on it. It was beautiful and drove great. As the 60,000 mile mark started to tick on the odometer, it started to fall apart. Every 1,000 miles the oil light would come on. I would take it in and the dealer said \"add a quart of oil!\" Thank you but is my car burning that much oil that I need to add a quart every 1000 miles or less? They offered to replace the turbos that \"might\" be the problem... Then the transmission problems started in. A very loud \"clunk\" every time you hit the gas pedal from a stop. Back to the dealer, \"past the warranty, 7,000$, sorry, dont know what to tell you.\"  Apparently the transmission slips into neutral when you stop and then clunks into  \"gear\" (CVT transmission)  when you hit the gas. It sounded and felt like the transmission was falling out everytime you stopped at a stop sign. It was embarrassing. It had to be driven like a manual and ease it in. Then the interior rattles started. It sounded like something was loose in the doors, every door. The kicker was when I started dating a girl that drove a 1 year newer Jetta. It was THE EXACT SAME CAR with the same features for way less money. She opted for the manual transmission so no tranny problems for her.The good things about the car is that it has comfortable seats and the interior design is comfortable, although, coating on the plastic will start peeling off so your interior will look 10 years old after 5 years.I had enough and traded it in. After 2 years of ownership I realized I could have bought a new car for cash with all the repairs and losses. The first thing the dealer asked when I traded it in and before he looked at the car was \"Let me guess, Tranny or electrical?\" Sums it up right there... Way Too Many Problems.... I love Audis, and have always wanted one for myself. I purchased my first Audi less than a year ago - a used 2009 Audi A4. It was fantastic for a few months....and then the oil problems started. Less than a year in and I have spent over $2,000 fixing oil problems which are not covered under the recent lawsuit. It really has made the car not worth it in the least. Additionally, the first Audi dealership I went to, had the worst service I have ever experienced. STAY AWAY FROM AUDI OF WESTWOOD MASS! They literally broke my engine hood one of the times I had to leave my car there. Everything about them was terrible from misquoting repair costs to not getting the right repair done the first time. They are horrible. So yeah, love the car but it\\'s unfortunately not worth it. Go for a Benz or BMW I guess. GET RID OF THE MINUTE WARRANTY EXPIRES Electrical system malfunction melted spark plug and blew #2 cylinder at 58000 miles during an uphill climb.  As of review, i do not have full scope of engine damage, but was quoted $5700.00 to replace engine with another Turbo charged 4 with 100K on it....NO THANKSDone with AUDI 2009 A4- stay away I bought it with 24000 miles and am going to sell it as soon as it gets out of CPO.  I have replaced the motor mounts 3 times, a steering hose twice, and just got done replacing the pistons.  All these repairs were done before 55,000 miles.  I now have about 62k on it, and can\\'t wait to sell it.  This car has been a nightmare and would have cost more than $12000 in repairs if it wasn\\'t a CPO car. Audi buyers beware!!! I have owned the Audi A4 for over eight months three days after driving the car from the dealership the oil low alarm came on. I called the dealership that sold me the car they said that having to add one quart of oil after driving 800 miles was acceptable?????? \"Acceptable\" really, I called Audi USA and asked why were they selling cars that used oil off the show room floor, I was told that in the eyes of Audi this was an acceptable level of normal oil consumption. Fast forward from 2009 till present in total the car has spent more time in the repair shop than on the road, we have replaced the motor and turbo and the oil consumption increased to a quart of oil with every fill up of gas. Worst car Ever!! Owning an Audi has been the worst experience ever!! Have owned it for 2.75 years now.Leased it after coming from a BMW I loved the free maintenance but this was an extra $800 for the Audi care package.I was able to negotiate it into the lease for no cost, so glad.My wife and I thought we got a great deal cuz we got all the bells and whistles for the same cost of a BMW base model.Well I hate driving this car and am so happy to give it back in 3 months.Audi service department sucks!!!You are nobody when you walk in.As soon as they see that I have Audi Care they start treating you better but they dont listen to you and dont call you when your car is done.  Awesome after 24000 miles This is an update from my original review. I\\'ve had my A4 for a 16 months and 24k miles now and I think it\\'s only fair to review it past the \\'new car feeling\\'.Still handles like a champion. Have had ZERO issues with the car. Haven\\'t had any unscheduled dealer visits. I would definitely recommend the car to someone looking for a 3 series alternative. The A4 is way more affordable and offers the same level of confort at a higher value. The car needs to be serviced at 5k, 15k and 25k. I added 1 qt of oil at 21500 miles which I consider normal given the interval within services. excellent design, reliability much worse than in the past Went from the 2003 A4 model to 2009 - old model was a real german design - tight handling, powerful, good brakes.The new one gained in dimensions - you feel inside like in a mid-size car, but the steering is too soft, I guess to appeal more to american drivers.Just one note - the car is not anymore a 100% german car - parts are made in other parts of the world and the overall quality has suffered.Have that in mind - repairs over the 4/50k warranty are very expensive both parts and labor - currently at 35k miles and thinking to trade-in. Poor Choice,Beware Audi has lots of work to do still I bought a brand new Audi A4 Premium Plus 2.0T quattro 2009 sedan. No problems up until about 5K+ miles, thereafter increasing engine sound / noise, gears not changing and getting stuck at 2nd/3rd gear. Reverse gear failed to engage during winter of 2009. Transmission filter & fluid was replaced, which resolved the problem for several months, until onset of winter 2010, the same problems are back now. Additionally card DRINKS oil, had to be in twice already to top up oil (car has 20K miles on it presently). Rattling and crackling noises are fairly frequent, which should NOT be seen in a luxury brand. God bless & long live Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, BMW & Mercedes. Please Stay CLEAR of AUDI ! Buy/Lease a Japanese Car Instead Audi\\'s 4 cylinder engine - 2.0 ltr - is a poorly designed and engineered engine.  It is not smooth and has a slight roughness at idle. The engine burns oil -about one quart every 1200 miles or so.  Audi USA says this is normal for a car with an MSRP of $40,000+.  Audi obviously went the cheap route and doesn\\'t ant to stand behind its product. I buy or lease cars for their engine reliability.  And in this department, Audi is a definite loser.  Buy or lease a Honda Accord, Lexus, Toyota- upscaled models nicely equipped.  They are far better cars and their manufacturers stand behind their products - unlike Audi. Audi, good for a boat anchor Our 2009 A4, 2.o ltr is our 2nd leased Audi.  We liked the larger size compared to our 2006 A4. Our honeymoon, however, was short-lived. The car consumed more than one qt of oil prior to the 1st dealer oil change. By the 15k change, the car consumed more than 4 quarts.  There was also an issue with a leaking water pump and a throttle gizmo that caused uneven idling.  Now taking the car back and forth to the local dealer to \"confirm\" the oil consumption. 4th trip today.  The dealer did say that Audi of America is going to say oil consumption of 1200 miles/quart of oil is \"normal.\"  The center LED brake light now broke too.  Car is a piece of crap! Buyer/lessee beware! Last Audi for me. re: update 1/10 \"from the outside...\" Well, I loved my Audi A4 but I had to trade it for a larger and more comfortable car. I traded it for a SUV.  Size: People are not able to sit in the back of the car comfortably.  It\\'s a sports car with back seats added to it to make it look larger.  Try to fit a car seat in the back with another child & you will be sorry because it will not work. I am also 9 months pregnant and I was upset every single day over the lack of quality care that the German\\'s put into the comfort of this vehicle. The driving experience was nice & I really liked both the interior and exterior look of the car.  I never had any mechanical problems with the car and the gas mileage was great. 2009 A4 Burns Oil I\\'ve had my A4 back to the dealer 4 times for excessive oil consumption. They\\'ve gone as far as replacing all of my pistons/ring (took 30 days) to complete and it still consumes about 1 qt. every 1500 miles. Power steering hose is on recall so had that repair completed at the same time and had to take it back again for the power steering hose. This car looks awesome but just isn\\'t very well built I have confronted Audi and they say it is NORMAL for a car to burn up to 1 qt. every 1000 MILES. This would be 9 quarts of oil between oil changes. My 1997 Explorer with 185K miles didn\\'t go through oil like this. The best amongst the Germans Like probably most people, I looked at the BMW 3, Benz C, Acura TL, and Infiniti G37 before finally settling on the A4.  I wanted first and foremost a car that was fun to drive both on the daily commute and weekend trip.  I also wanted a car that stood out.  Unfortunately, it seems that everyone in this segment naturally gravitates towards the 3, usually because that is all they have heard of.  What I found in the A4 is a car that gives me all the performance with real handsome looks both inside and out (yes, I am a sucker for those LED head lights).  The car is incredible to drive, especially in Sports mode.  While I miss the torque of the 2.0T, the 3.2 is the one to have. Looks Can Be Deceiving I love everything about the car.  It runs great, the Prestige package has everything anyone could want at a great price, and the car\\'s styling is superb.  The only down side to the car is that it burns 5 quarts of oil between oil changes, as was confirmed by a recent oil consumption test at the dealership.  This is kind of an annoyance for a vehicle that stickers for over $40,000 new. This car is horrible Worst decision of my car buying life.  It was the only 2009 left on the lot and had every conceivable option.  Problems arose quickly - 1. The steering feels like something is rubbing or a belt it loose - back to dealership 3 times before I was told that there was a service bulletin out on it and no fix yet. 2 Transmission lurches in the dynamic mode - after 3 visits was told that there was a service bulletin out on it and there was no fix yet. Filled out more than one survey on it and never received help.  For an almost $50K car, this is a disgrace.  Have written Audi many times to just give me my money back.  How do you think that is going.  Bad mistake. Wolf in Sheep\\'s CLothes Retiring the 3.2 liter and making the 3.0T only available as a hopped up S goes down as one of the biggest mistakes Audi ever made.  I commute to Boston daily 20 miles each way that takes anywhere from 25 minutes to 90 minutes.  Sitting in traffic, slow easy driving it\\'s a dream.  Drives on a cloud like the old Cadillacs i grew up driving (but smaller!).  Hit the accelerator though and the wolf comes out. This car jumps and the power just seems to keep coming.  Tested this against the new A6 3.0T (too big and disconnected from the road), G37 (surprisingly nice car but too many of them on the road), BMW - lacks the lady-like good nature of the Audi Pure awesome-ness I own a 2009 A4 2.0T FSI Quattro Prestige S-Line. What an amazing and fun car to drive!  Pros: Performance: responsive, good handling, grips the road and can make tight corners, 0-60 in 6.7 sec as advertised, smooth ride even with sport suspensions. Styling: beautifully done interior, exterior styling is amazing with nice flowing lines, still loving the LED lights after 26K. Reliability: reliable, no maintenance issues at all, all in all, a great car! Other: B&F audio is a must! 31 mpg highway  Cons: Stock tires are noisy at high speeds above 60 mph -Torque steer issues that Audi has no fix for still. MMI interface does not support other languages -18 mpg city -Slow start off the line Loving this car! The new A4 is a terrific car.  It\\'s beautifully styled inside and out.  It is comfortable to drive on long trips yet sporty and fun enough to drive fast on twisty roads.  A lot of reviewers complain about the 4-cylinder engine and its buzz, but I love the sound of a turbo 4.  I wish they had put the GTIs sound amplifier in the A4, but can understand why they didn\\'t considering the different demographics.  The main problem I have with the car is that it gets expensive when you start adding features other luxury car manufacturers include as standard.  At an MSRP of $38K, the Premium Plus trim doesn\\'t seem like a bargain against the 328XI, especially since the BMW has standard maintenance. I think my live was worth $37K I think this car saved my life. Cruising at ~30 mph, then I was rear ended at ~60 mph by a Nissan, then hit head-on by a Cadillac at ~35 mph!  Audi was totaled but performed great, did not walk away, but \"only\" have a badly broken foot.  Purchased new in spring of \\'09 versus a cpo a4 or BMW 3 series.  The new 09 a4 was such a huge change and looked so good it was worth the extra $100/month to me.  Wanted a standard 6 speed trans. But was strong armed into the auto/tiptronic.  The quattro system is awesome, the 2.0 turbo had plenty of power and I averaged 30 mpg in mostly highway driving over 12k miles  before it was totaled.  Would reconsider with a manual trans. And clear-bra.  Beautiful Very happy with this car so far. Was hesitant about purchasing an Audi as I have been partial to the reliability of Japanese brands for many years. The car had everything I was looking for. Good gas mileage, beautifully designed exterior and interior, safety features, good handling and responsiveness. This is my first Audi and I am hoping it will be as reliable as my previous Japanese made car.  Navigation packet and blue tooth I got the navigation packet with the car and I am very disappointed with it. The navigation system is completely useless, difficult to use and find places, and lacks information about almost everything. It serves only for ornamental purposes as it doesn\\'t take anybody anywhere. Even worse the situation, only two months after I got the car, I got the offer of the navigation update and ridiculously, I had to order and pay for it myself. This issue was not addressed by Fred Baker, the dealer, neither by audi after several calls and emails I made to them. The bluetooth does not connect to my phone either. Love My A4 A smile is on my face every day I drive this fabulous car.  Youngsters compliment me on its looks.  It sticks to the road like glue.  Unbelievable confidence in bad weather. Great fuel economy. Incredible handling and steering.  Stops on a dime.  Sports package 18\" wheels and sports suspension/seats option. Great Car, but ... This is the perfect car for my needs.   It\\'s \"fun enough\" to drive, looks good, and gets great fuel economy considering its size and performance.  I\\'ve been a long-time VW and Audi owner and I really do think they offer a great trade-off between value and fun.  However, this \\'09 A4 is similar to my past VWs and Audis as it still has a number of small (typical Audi) quality issues.  This \\'09 A4 has suffered from an ignition switch failure, reverse backing light bulb installation issue, broken rear seat cup holder, and came with a defective exterior trim piece.  None of these issues have been major but give me my usual uneasy feeling about owning this car for the long-term.  From the outside to the inside, it is an awesome car Currently at 5,000 miles - quattro loaded, automatic, 4-door.  From the outside to the inside, it is an awesome car.  I have had zero problems out of the internal or external parts of the car.  The major things that ppl suggest to improve for this car are not a problem for me with my car.  No buyer\\'s remorse here, just happiness even in the winter.  One small note:  If you have a back injury or something close to it, you may want to buy another model other than the A4.  It\\'s a sports model and it can be uncomfortable for you.  The seats are low minus a lot of cushion. Magnificent suspension The suspension on this car is magnificent!  It handles curves like a slingshot, by far my favorite car so far. Questioning the Audi Quality I just took home a new 2009 Audi A4 quattro 4 dr sedan Premium plus today and just before we got home the car seemed to choke as I stepped on the accelerator. It was also showing a blinking check engine light on the dash board.  It comes and goes but to think that you just got it out from the dealer and now you have to bring it back to have it checked for problems.  We should have bought a more reliable car like a Honda or Toyota.  It may not be as luxurious as an Audi but it sure is more cheap and RELIABLE.  Still not a Smooth Ride I have had my 2009 Audi for about 6 months now. Bought it slightly used with 12k, now has 20k. Love the looks, love the power, and love the quattro. But as hard as I try and as many times as I take it to the dealership, it still vibrates at speeds 75-85 MPH, as if the tires aren\\'t quite balanced right. I spend a lot of time on the road and this drives me crazy! Also, I\\'ve developed several rattles in the speakers and other parts of the car. I had a 1996 Audi in the past that I would say I was much happier with than this car. Probably won\\'t end up keeping it very long. Something to consider I purchased an 09 Premium Plus and found the seats to be super uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that I ended up trading it in with only 4,000 miles on it for another \\'09 A4, but this one had the sport seats (M3-style retractable thigh support bolsters)and better shoulder support plus paddle shifters. Night and day. While I could never get quite comfortable in my Premium Plus I was immediately very comfortable and have been for the past 16,000 miles in my Sport package model. The only issue is that from what I understand Audi has discontinued the \"Sport Package\" and now only offers the better seats in the S4.  Something to consider- you will not like the stock seats if you are 5\\'10\"+. Great Car I\\'ve had this car for almost a month with 1300 miles on it. It is an awesome car with excellent driving dynamics. I can hardly believe it is a 4 cylinder, but I\\'m reminded of it when I idle the engine with the windows down. I returned a leased 2007 Lexus IS350 and at no point did I feel like I downgraded although this vehicle was $7000 less. The interior room is cavernous and the ergonomics are superb. Acceleration is amazing for any size engine not to mention for a 4 cyl. The Bluetooth integration is excellent as it reads your entire phonebook and makes accessible at your steering wheel controls. The front end with the LED Running lights makes this car spell luxury. A blast to drive Fun to drive in country roads, especially with S mode.  The exterior with daylight running light draws attentions and the interior design, especially with the red back lights, is just beautiful. The fuel economy is good with over 33 mpg highway and 27 mixed highway/city driving. A car that earns praises The performance is great with sports mode, but the suspension is a bit bumpy for my taste (I can feel every road bump), but I guess that\\'s what you get for a more sports tuned suspension. Fuel economy is not bad for a 211hp AWD car; I\\'m getting about 30 mpg on the highway and average about 25 highway/city driving.  It is definitely a fun to drive car with very tight turning circle.  Interior and exterior design earn many praises from my friends.  The problem is I\\'m getting the shimmy around 62 mph (hence points off in reliability) and the diagnosis from Audi Engineering is bad control arms. I\\'m keeping my fingers crossed that replacing control arms will cure the shimmies. Best in class I\\'ve had the Audi for 2,500km so far. It is amazing. Fuel efficiency is great for a car with this much power. The 2.0 is more powerful than the 3.2 for the first 100km (60mph). I have the navi and tech pkg. Everything is voice activated. Back up camera is very handy. Proximity sensor locks and engine start are very convenient. EPS is nicely engineered. Audi side assist is handy. Seats are very comfortable. Breaks are high performance. I tested the Lexus IS250 and the BMW 328xi also. I have heard \"Hey man nice car!\" from over 10 people in 3 weeks. So that covers the exterior design. Red Bull must be more popular in Germany than North America (one of the cup holders is small).   Great car Turbo 4 provides plenty acceleration with good gas mileage. Handling is unreal.  Considered the BMW 328 and Cadillac CTS. Both were great but did not appear worth the extra cost (insurance, maintenance and purchase price).    A fun car to drive I\\'ve had the car about 7 months now and no major complaints, except for the wind (see below). The A4 drives well, though it\\'s not quite as responsive as well as my 2006 BMW 5 series. Steering is tight, brakes are just a bit grabby, and power is strong. The AWD is the best, especially in heavy, slushy snow. The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open. Poor wind engineering. And it\\'s difficult to find a good open position of the sunroof so it doesn\\'t make noise. Seems like it has to be readjusted for every speed level. A Much Better A4  I had the 06 A4. The 09 model is much bigger, for a tall guy like me, a great improvement. The LED light and the media control really made my decision much easier (we were choosing among Audi, BMW, MB, and Volvo). Best value for its class. It has been a month since we got it, we liked everything. Great car but uncomfortable  front seats Both front seats proved to be uncomfortable during long driving periods. The problem is that the seat\\'s side support bolsters are so high and firm (firmer than all other luxury  cars of the same class)  that they provide undue pressure on the hip bones.  The outside side supporting plastic exacerbates the situation by noT allowing any amount of downward give of the seat. Thus,  when exiting the vehicle, the plastic support and firm bolster provides undue pressure on legs.  Superb I\\'ve had my Audi A4 for one week now.  Excellent well designed car.  Sharp styling with excellent design/fit and finish on the interior.  MMI is really slick.  Performance on the 2.0T is excellent - strong pull due to high torque.  No problems with the CVT thus far.  Exhaust note gives a good growl when accelerating.  Pricing right now has been really good too! Loved our Cab so much, bought a Sedan Just picked up an Aruba Blue,Premium Plus with Navi and wood trim.  My wife has a 2009 Cab (older platform) for about a year now. I love driving it so much that I shopped the end of season sales for a sedan for me and found a great deal.  I was driving an \\'04 Accord with 100k trouble-free miles and had no desire to give it up.  The Audi\\'s driving dynamics, power and smoothness of the engine are great (even vs. Cab) and gas mileage is quite good.  It\\'s also the perfect size I was looking for.  The gray interior is beautiful.  The MMI is awesome as is the bluetooth and stereo.  Seats very comfortable as well.  If reliability is on par with the Honda, this will be the best car I\\'ve ever owned. Sweet A4 This car is simply stunning, especially from the outside, especially with the Prestige package I got. Handling is very balanced, ride is sporty yet comfortable for longer commutes. Quattro provides excellent grip and 2.0T is powerful yet fuel efficient (have gotten 35 mpg cruising). Plus, this car is as big as the Passat I traded in. Some downsides include having to get Prestige to get those stunning 18\" wheels and 4 cyl. a little course when revved hard. But overall, I loved my choice for my first luxury brand car. New car is great minus a little problem I\\'ve only owned my new car for about a month and a half, almost 2 months now. The day after I bought it, it had a check engine light on. 3 trips to the dealership in a month and a half later, I got the fuel pump replaced. I\\'m hoping this problem doesn\\'t continue because I really do love the car. I feel I should relate my experience to others so they can be informed buyers, though. Aside from this inconvenience, I really do like my car.  Acceleration lag Owned a 2004 C230 and moved on to Audi A4 cvt FWD. Like the styling and seating comfort. Speedometer is a little ridiculous for US driving. When sunroof is open sound is deafening but main issue is the acceleration lag when in D. Lessens somewhat when put in S mode. I use regular gas, premium is recommended, will try that next. Sweet machine This is my third A4 in four years, passing them on to the kids or trade in on lease. The 2009 Prestige is one sweet machine. Better performance than than older (2006 and 2007 A4) with more torque and horsepower with highway mileage 33 mpg level road at 65-75. Also looked at BMW  with AWD but run flats and many thousands more $ just not worth the difference, (and I have had  BMW 3 series in the past). Great cruiser at 90 mph and around town. It is bigger than older A4, as big as I can tolerate. $37900  with 0.9% and 1 k down a great deal, than 4200 off MSRP, I will buy it rather than lease. Be sure to test drive prior to purchase This is a great looking car and fun  drive but has one major flaw. If you attempt to accelerate fast from a dead stop by mashing the accelerator, the transmission hesitates for a full second before the turbo kicks in.  This can be dangerous when attempting to make a left turn in front of approaching traffic. I was told by the dealer that this is a common complaint because of the tiptronic transmission and cannot be corrected. You simply cannot throttle the vehicle hard from a stop and there is no fix. They said that I would get used to it. Be sure to test drive the vehicle before purchasing. I only test drove mine for a few miles.  A4 Me The commute has gotten a lot more pleasant since the A4 S-Line came in. The Audi is quiet, comfortable, and effortlessly easy to drive.  The Alcantara seats are cooler than full leather in hot Louisiana summers.  MMI is easy to use and useful after very short learning curve.  The steering wheel scroll buttons make dialing phone numbers, radio surfing preset stations easy and safe.  The daily commute is a 70/30 mix of highway (65-70 mph)and stop-n-go traffic and the Audi delivers an amazing avg 28-31 mpg with mindful throttle (depends on traffic, weather). Despite the 19\" wheels and summer perf. tires the ride is firm without being jarring (test before buying). Gorgeous and feature laden. Fun to drive I was a previous MINI Cooper S owner and was looking for something else that was fun to drive. I spend about 2 hours of my day commuting and the Audi A4 Quattro 2.0 with the Premium Plus package fits what I need.  It has fun and comfort. I\\'m a big tech geek and the A4 meets my needs. My favorite feature has to be the MMI.  I had this car for almost 3 months and it has been excellent ever since except for a few strange rattle noises coming from the doors.  It\\'s a big head turner... so be prepared. I have had people in the freeway cruise up to me on the next lane, just so they can turn their head to view the led lights.  Very spirited car 09 A4 2.0T CVT Prem Plus Quartz Gray. Terrific styling with an equal balance of handling and performance to please the enthusiast.  MPG, safety, features & opts are solid, only sedan w/ a D pillar. 2-Tone gray interior is best out of other sedans tested. Love the lane change tap w/ side mirror LED\\'s. Multitronic CVT proves powerful, mechanical and engine notes (DFI techno) make me smile. All around a spirited and sporty car. Worst car ever owned I am 600 miles into an Audi A4 Quattro and it is the worst car I have ever owned. The driver seat is so uncomfortable I can only sit in the car for no more than 45 min. All the dealer suggested is to get a pad. The ride is awful - pebbles become large rocks, rough roads rattle your teeth. I am missing my old Ford 500 more every day. If you are considering this car be wary, take a long test drive. Audi A4 3.2 Quattro Prestige, Sports Pac My car choices when searching came down to the BMW 335 sedan, Lexus GS 350, and the Audi A4. I decided to purchase the A4 based on the features and price.  The A4 has the quattro AWD, fold down rear seats, 14 speaker Bang and Olufsen system, bluetooth and navigation.  I felt that the exterior styling and the better interior features of the A4 outweighed the engine performance of the 335i.  The Lexus rear bumper styling just didn\\'t grow on me. So far after driving the car for the first 1000 miles I am so happy about my decision.  The A4 is fast off the line and pulling on the freeway in sports mode, the handling is great with the quattro, and it\\'s very eye catching with the LED driving lights. Outstanding This is my first entry level luxury sedan purchase. I\\'m very thorough in my research and compared BMW, Lexus and Audi. Performance, quality and style made Audi the best choice for me.  The Best of Both Worlds! I\\'ve driven everything in this segment from Lexus IS, MBenz, to BMW and this car is the best combination of Luxury, Performance, and comfort. I chose the Prem Plus Sport Pkg with 18s and 6spd Manual! Audi has completely raised the bar with this one. The sport pkg takes the handling threshold into triple digits with ease. Plus I\\'ve been getting 31.3 MPG cruising between 72- 80mph hwy which is unheard of. I had a 2007 Infiniti G35x and never got north of 19MPG.  Just drive the A4 once and you\\'ll understand completely. And it just gets better Our first experience with Audi came after my wife turned a triple 360 on a slick road in an Acura TL.  For our next car purchase safety and engineering were at the top of the requirements list. After a 2002 A6, 2002 TT Roadster, and 2007 A4, we took possession of a 2009 A4 2.0T Quattro with Premier Plus option package.  The improvements in the 2009 A4 are impressive and reflect Audi\\'s continued excellence in engineering.  This model, with it\\'s increased length and width, adjustments to the engine mounts to reduce the vibration in the 2.0 four cylinder engine, and the tweaks to the acceleration off the line make us feel like we\\'re back in our A6.  Roomy, feature rich, rides on rails. A4 Round Deux I previously owned an 06 A4 with all bells and whistles in it and I loved the car. When it was up I got an 09 stick premium plus model with sport package and nav, and the car is amazing. The sport suspension really gives the car that sporty feel and the summer tires make the car hug the road and handle amazing. This car also has more low end torque which works really well when getting onto highways. The 2006 model was more sporty, but with the sport package it makes this car a great mix of sport and luxury. Modern, but rough around the edges I purchased this car for the winter weather performance, blend of fuel efficiency and power, stunning appearance, and advanced safety and technology features. Those the car achieves these easily.  Living with the car for a while, I would love to give it back. The primary drawback of the vehicle is the very rough ride over 50 MPH. The vehicle seems to transmit every nuance of the road surface into the cabin, the seats, and the floor. The suspension is just far, far too firm. Riding on rougher roads is continuously distracting, with tiny road imperfections intruding into an otherwise palatial experience. I urge anyone considering this vehicle to do an extended test drive. I wish I had. Hot car...Fun to drive Great car to drive. Comfortable ride. I went from the 08 to the 09 and it definitely feels better although Audi could have kept the full size spare tire and the regular cup holder. Minor things when compared to such huge improvements.   Great Ride If you\\'re the type of driver that wants to look forward to getting in your car, this Audi fits the bill.  Our A4 does not have the sport package so the steering and suspension is not as stiff responsive as let\\'s say an S- line Audi, but the ride is a smooth as can be (which my wife prefers).  This car is a real standout in the rain, extremely stable which I attribute to the Quattro. Haven\\'t driven it in the snow yet, but I imagine it will perform well. The seats are comfortable and the steering wheel feels great on your hands. Plenty of trunk space. The bluetooth telephone is seamless, hop in the car and the car takes the call. iPod attachment works great as well. Daytime running lights. Excellent Choice After months of study and countless test drives, I chose the Audi A4 quattro over the BMW 328xi and the new BMW 335d.  As a previous BMW 3-series owner, I agonized over the decision.  However, I cannot be happier.  After owning it a few weeks, it has exceeded my high expectations.  It is truly an incredible vehicle, with the perfect combination of all the options I was looking for.  After initially considering the base (premium) model with the add-ons I wanted, I ultimately opted for the prestige model with all the toys.  The icing on the cake is that I paid thousands less than a comparably equipped BMW with better mileage.   Great fun ride I had previously owned an A4 (2000). I remembered the fun it brought, so I thought I\\'d give it another chance when I began my car search. I also tried all the usual suspects. This was simply the best bang for the buck. I went with the Premium package with AWD. You don\\'t need anything more than that. I read many reviews by other readers and I agree with the positive vibe on this newly improved model. Love this car!!! I wanted a German sedan and test drove the big three.  Hands down I was the most impressed with the Audi A4.  I went with the 2.0T because it has more torque than the V6!  Very responsive and I am getting over 30 MPG on the highway! The MMI interface was better than the other two systems.  Hunted down a 2.0T in Black with a Prestige package.  I wanted the 18\" rims and the Bang & Olufsen Stereo.  The Audi\\'s interior looks rich while the others\\' look cheaper.  The rear seat room is much better in the Audi. I am falling in love. This is my first Audi purchase after many years of Volkswagen ownership and so far I am loving every mile of it.  I chose the Premium Plus and 18\" Sport packages. The seats are very comfortable and all controls are easy to use although I find using the MMI creates an extra step to do just about anything except adjust the radio volume. As typical for a German automobile, everything is placed logically. The steering wheel is weighted nicely but the paddles on the back of wheel are too small to make good use of them.  I placed my order 10/08 and would have preferred a M/T but the timing just wouldn\\'t work for me to wait that long. Other than that I can\\'t really complain. No Brainer Living in the Snowbelt had a dilemma which car to pick. I was looking for manual and 4 wheel drive, turned out that there are not many options available. The instance when I sit- down into Audi, realized that I like this car after the test drive I felt in love with it; signed the contract hour later.  If you are looking for great looking comfortable car which can pump the blood through your veins go with A4 manual \\x96 BEST CAR on the market.  Fantastic! I\\'ve had my A4 Premium Plus for about 6 months and I\\'m still completely in love with it. It is always so much fun to drive especially around turns on the parkway. Best car I\\'ve ever owned, my old Mercedes does not even compare to this car. It hasn\\'t failed me yet. Not to mention, heads turn when I drive down the street, the car\\'s gorgeous!  Fun to Drive, Smooth Ride! Previously owned two 6-cylinder Jaguar X-Types. The Audi A4 ride is fantastic; the 4-cylinder Quattro engine is very powerful. Tiptronic manual shift is fun (but dangerous-- must be careful to avoid speeding ticket)! This vehicle is beautiful, roomy, and hugs the road. Because it\\'s low to the ground you have to be careful when parking, so the front end isn\\'t damaged by concrete barriers. Lovely drive, a hit @ home Looked at the Infiniti G37 and BMW 3 series before settling on the Audi A4. Owned an A6 over 10 years ago, and wasn\\'t sure if we we\\'d buy another Audi, but the A4 has bested all my expectations in the little time I\\'ve had it. Didn\\'t need AWD as we have a SUV at home, so I got the FWD with Sport package in Premium Plus trim. Car drives beautifully, hugs the road esp on turns, sounds great, and the LEDs turn heads for sure. The MMI is very easy to learn and the AMI and Bluetooth work like a breeze. The extended length also comes in handy. The next few years will tell me how much they\\'ve improved the Reliability but so far so good. A4 2.0l TDI 8 speed auto We\\'ve got the diesels and I bought one 3 weeks ago and traded my 2007 BMW 328i. It looks great, the interior is beautiful and the ride is nice and comfortable without being too \\'sloppy\\'. The BMW was my first and last - the ride was horrible. This is as powerful, the auto changes cannot be felt, even in sport mode unless you really look for it - I\\'m old and like smooth! There is no perfection but this car is excellent in every way. The diesel engine does clatter but you can\\'t really hear it from inside except when you accelerate and then it\\'s only a bit of noise - like noisy tappets on an old car. Great. Great Car for the money  I am a 7-time BMW owner and was hesitant to compare the new Audi A4 to a 2009 BMW 3 series, but was surprisingly pleased with the build quality, performance, and amenities you get in the Premium Plus package and decided to go with a new 2009 A4 vs the BMW 328xi. I have only owned my new Audi A4 for a few days now, but am very pleased with the build quality, ride, and performance of this car. Anyone is the premium sport sedan market should take a serious look at the A4 before making a decision.  Best of the Bst After owning BMW\\'s and Mercedes (2 lemons in a row), this is my 1st Audi. It is awesome! Very comfortable, wonderful variable steering, great electronics. I am impressed by the 4 cylinder turbo; quick acceleration, especially when down shift to the \"S\" mode (passed 5 cars on 2 lane country road-WOW!). We take it on the Interstate every weekend while our BMW 330 sits in the garage. Gas mileage is 24 around town and 27-30 on highway, depending on how I drive. The 2009 A-4 surpasses my expectations.  Quirks you should know I\\'ve had the car for about 5000 miles so far, and probably would not buy it again. There\\'s much I truly love about the car but the commuting ride quality on worn roads is very harsh, especially here in New England roads where the car is useful in snow. Since delivery car has real vibration 70 - 80 MPH. I\\'ve seen others talk about this, and dealer has not resolved. I plan to take it to an independent tire spot.  Speedometer seemed high, and reads about 4-5% higher than actual speed when calibrated with GPS. 77 MPH shows as 80 or 81. Racking up extra miles if you leased!  Car is good from stop lights, but 2.0T feels underpowered with highway onramps, etc. Requires \"S\" mode and a heavy foot. Love it! I like almost everything about my new Audi A4.  The one negative thing is that the rims get dirty every time I drive it, even if its around the corner.  Someone mentioned that it might be the brakes.   Update Original post- 09/28/08  Car remains a blast to drive- stereo remains a favorite, bi-xenon lights are worth extra money. Significant difference in driving in S mode and super fun on twisting roads. Car handles fantastic in winter (installed winter tires & with all wheel drive - go anywhere as along as snow drifts aren\\'t too high) Car is low - watch out for curbs & cement stops in parking places! Overall am very pleased with purchase after 4 1/2 months driving - you still want to go out just for the heck of it! What could be better - more horsepower (?), ride over bumps could be a bit smoother (but then you\\'d lose the sports car feel). Just a great car!  A4 with Sport Package I got the A4 with Premium Plus, Nav and the Sport Package in Quartz Grey four months ago. The styling of the A5 caught my attention and when Audi applied it to the A4, it when to the top of my list. Beautiful interior with Aluminum Trim (not cheap plastic like my Chrysler) with plenty of leg room all around and the layout is excellent. The Engine has plenty of power and the brakes are amazing. The ride is a little stiff with the Sport Package and 18\" low-profile summer tires, but it tracks around corners fast and flat. Sport seats hold you in place and are comfortable on long trips. Safest car I\\'ve ever owned. Thanks to Edmunds for supplying loads of info towards my purchase.   Luxurious appointed interior/exterior  I love this car, and it has been great. At 1200 miles it feels like a dream to drive... no issues. I get plenty of compliments and makes me feel happy to drive it. The engine has good giddy up in the low-speed range. Once you\\'re higher up, engine feels like it struggles to move up, nevertheless it\\'s fast enough for me unless you\\'re looking for a speeding ticket. Excellent Ride Went from an \\'06 A4 2.0 Quattro to this.  This is the \\'06 all grown up.  The ride is tremendous and smooth.  Very quiet in the cab which is great for blue-tooth calls.  Handling is superb.  Handles even better over 90 as all German cars should.  Excellent off the line.  Sport mode is stellar with the v6.  Light package makes you feel like a rock star as you turn heads.   Good car, but consumes oil I love the car, it is quiet, low road noise. But, it burns oil. At 600 miles I have had to put in a half quart already. Furthermore, you would think for a car that burns so much oil, it would come with a dipstick, but, it does not. I wish I would have researched problems like this before buying. I do regret my decision now, oh, and for Audi, the current oil consumption is within their limits so, I drive with oil in my trunk at all times. Hits The Mark In the three years leading up to this car, I drove a Saab 9-3. And I admittedly enjoyed the car. But after driving the Audi A4, I can\\'t imagine ever going back to another manufacturer. The handling is tight, the speed is quick and the ride is firm without being hard. Love this car! Love this car.  It\\'s fun to drive and has character.  It may not be the fastest in its class, but it is fast enough.  The interior design is excellent and the interior space is much more roomier than the older A4s.  Personally, I think the exterior design is nicer than the 3 series and C class. No More Corvettes After two Corvettes, I decided I needed something more practical but still fun to drive.  The Infiniti G37X was a little too small and too stiff and the 328xi a little too expensive.  The A4 was just right.  It handles well and accelerates nicely with the turbo 4.  I don\\'t think the V6 adds much more.  It holds 4 people comfortably.  I wouldn\\'t go for 5 unless 3 are very small.  The trunk is huge.  The interior is handsome and the sound system is fine.  This is my first experience with BlueTooth and its much better than OnStar. From a 2007 G35 to a REAL CAR!!! I just got the A4 AWD 2.0T AT White w/ Black interior Premium Plus with the custom OEM Audi Sport 18\" rims on all seasons and added the chrome tips. Changing the wheels and tips turns this car into a whole entire different animal. The ride is 100% better than my last sedan 2007 G35 AWD. This sedan is a much better value than the BMW AWD 3 series and the Benz C AWD. I love the ride and now I think I will be an Audi fan for a long time!! This car is not like previous Audi\\'s Ever since I saw the R8 commercials on the Superbowl, I\\'ve been following Audi more closely. I\\'m glad I did. I own the new 2009 Audi, and I\\'ve been so impressed with it. Watch out for this car. It accelerates 0-60 a full second faster than the previous Audi A4\\'s. The LED lights are so cool. The braking is amazing. People stop dead in their tracks and look at it. Put this thing in S mode and drive down a windy road. The car grips the road, and it\\'s substantially different than in D, it\\'s not some gimmick.  The best German car period Being stationed in Europe, I have had the privilege to drive on the infamous Autobahn. I truly believe that Audi is the best German automobile. I have owned three,  TT, A6 and now the new A4, all quattros. This new generation Audi is over the top. I bought this car for my wife as an anniversary present.     We took a trip together and this car feels, looks, smells, sounds and handles just like a German automobile should.  The B & O sound system is the best sound system I have ever heard.  Our car comes fully equipped with the exception for navigation and suspension control.    The days of notoriety of owning a MB or BMW are over.  I always thought they were overrated.  So this is what the fuss was all about! After drooling over it since it came out I finally picked up the 2.0 Turbo with the Premium Plus package in brilliant red with tan interior. This car is awesome! The turbo has excellent giddy-up, and the extra foot lbs. of Torque give this car plenty of pop of the line and set it apart from any other seday in its class. The Audi MMI can be challenging at 1st, but once you get the hang of it is very easy to use. I love the ipod integration (a must for me) and the bluetooth phone feature that downloads your phone book. The new body style provides plenty of room in the back for my 3 year old daughter. I had an MDX, and I now love to drive again! ps. The LED\\'s are poppin\\'!   Audi A4 Prestige with navigation  This is a fantastic vehicle!  I test drove numerous vehicles before purchasing the Audi A4 including the Lexus IS250, BMW 328xi, Mercedes-Benz C300 4MATIC, and the Acura TL. The A4 was the best vehicle hands down. The handling of this vehicle on wet and dry roads is excellent. I feel like I\\'m riding on rails even in the snow. The interior is beautiful and made with high quality materials. Every button and every dial feels great to the touch. The back seat has enough room for even your biggest family members. The trunk is enormous for a 4-door sedan.  This vehicle is extremely quick for a 4-cylinder turbo. The back-up camera is unlike any other you\\'ve ever seen!  LED lights turn heads!   No more need for BMW. My 550i lease just expired and I wanted to downsize the car but not the features. The A4 2.0 with Prestige seemed like just the answer. I have never heard a better car stereo than the B&O system that comes with the Prestige package.  The daytime LED\\'s are very cool and this design really hit the target!  I was also used to keyless go so this option is now a must have for me. Finally, the side alert is a great feature and my mirrors tell me if someone is in my blind spot with a flashing light.  Except for power I actually like this car a lot more than my 550i. Safe & Fun The new Audi A4 is perhaps the best of what Audi has produced. The German definition of engineering continues to be distinct with safety first and foremost. This car is fun to drive and I expect Audi to improve on its interior functionality in the next few years. For us larger drivers a better designed front seat would be appreciated. No doubt the quattro all wheel drive system ranks at the top in winter weather. If you are comparing models this is one you have to try. 328,000 Miles and still goin! 2.8 A4 Quatro is a blast to drive. Plenty of power, and great handling.  I purchased for $3500, upgraded tires to 17\", added modern Audi alloy wheels and upgraded pads and rotors to higher quality and faster cooling- all for just under $1200. The only issues I\\'ve had is replaced universal joint, and leak from power steering pump - power steering fluid for this car is eighteen bucks a quart.  The oil light comes on all the time however, this is due to the interior sensor clogging and not reading oil flow correctly, annoying but not a problem the radio can\\'t alleviate - hey, it happens, after all the car is twenty years old.  The paint is still immaculate and deep black, people simply cant believe this car is 20 years old! The cabin is a little noisy; I intend to replace the carpeting and in the process upgrade the floor insulation to mitigate road noise - the creeks and squeaks I\\'ll tame one at a time. GREAT CAR! Sure isn\\'t a Honda or Toyota!! I bought my A4 used about a year ago, and I have fallen in love! There is no other used car out there that can match the fun to drive, reliability, build quality, or fuel economy for that matter. I can manage around 20-24 around town, and at most 28 on the highway, that\\'s pretty good, considering its a 15 year old car with 215,000 miles on it, with a V6, and Quattro. Like I said, it has 215,000, and it still runs like a dream. The only problem I have had with it is an EGR code always popping up, I went thru the whole EGR system, and couldn\\'t find anything. Turns out it was the filler hose on the gas tank, sense it also leaked when I filled it up.  A4 ......my few words........eulogy I would say I gave my everything to this car, The car absolutely is a blast to drive , excellent winter vehicle and is a head turner. As a loyal audi fanatic , I have poured a great deal of money into the car, but, at 120,000 miles everything just started to go one week after another, I dont think I went 1000 miles between repairs. When no maintinence is needed, its a top notch, safe car, but overall I would say if reliability was a centerpoint for you, not a good bet for a used vehicle.I finally gave in and sold mine after years of ownership. That said I still would buy another one .....want my reason?.........Test drive one :)  Expensive repairs Paid about $6200. for the A4 2.8 quattro 6 cylinder.  Engine seized about a year later, cost $5,500 to replace with a used 50,000 mile engine.  A/C just packed it in, at the tune of $2,200 to fix.  Drivers door window falls into door.  LED\\'s on stereo are mostly burned out.  Very annoying buzz from rear wheels. Should have sold it. This review is cathartic because who cares about this car anymore.  Up until 45-50K it was okay as far as maintenance and repairs are concerned. After that look out.  It\\'s like a bad marriage you hope and deceive yourself into believing it will get better..and it doesn\\'t.  I could have bought another car with the amount of money spent on repairs.  It\\'s not just the cost but the repeated occurrences. The dealerships are horrible and AUDI USA is even worse. I will never again own an Audi unless its given to me, because then the cost of repairs will be like I purchased it. It shouldn\\'t cost me the price of 2 cars to own one. I\\'ll never buy an Audi again. Stay away. I bought this car mainly because of the look.  I still love the look.  It\\'s too bad the rest of the car doesn\\'t hold up.   These cars are finicky.  If you don\\'t use synthetic oil you are asking for trouble.  My car is dead after 150k miles due to oil sludge - which is sad for a car built in the 90s.  I gave it regular 3k oil changes, but I used normal oil.  That\\'s only part of the problem.  This car was in the garage every 6 months for this, that and the other.  Expensive suspension failures, Cat converters going out, water pump, cracked fluid reservoirs, valve gasket leak, etc., etc., etc.  Come on Audi - have some pride. Very Reliable I bought this car when it had 125k miles on it and have put 30k on it in two years.  The only thing that has needed replacement is the tires.  I live in Idaho so I see more snow than most cars do and it handles amazing in any weather. Summary Here is my two cents after putting 50K on my A4 which I purchased at 120K. Very reliable engine, manual transmission (same OEM clutch at 170K), no major electrical problems. What has failed, cruise control, driver side heated seat, thermostat. I believe overall it is a very reliable car, sensors that I have replaced along the way are just the same on all cars these days, all made by BOSCH and it doesn\\'t make a difference which brand you drive. In terms of interior/exterior design, ergonomics and build quality Audi is never any less than other Germans and maybe much better in some of these areas if not all. The up side is because of its reputation here in USA, you can get them much cheaper!! I love my 1997 Audi A4 I purchased my Audi in 1996 and drove it every day until I retired in 2002.  It\\'s great.  It\\'s been 100% reliable.  It\\'s a 5 speed stick shift red sedan.  I use to put lots of miles on it commuting to work and visiting family 4 hours away.  Now my life style has changed and my car is still thrilling to drive.  It sits for days when I don\\'t drive it and it still drives like a charm when I use it.  I\\'d buy this car again and again and again. Brilliant I bought this car after its 11th birthday, It had a very hard life before I bought it. But a bit of TLC took care of that. Even though I spent a lot of money on her, What she ended up costing me in total was still a bargain. I would rather have looked at a newer model if I could afford one, But the fact is it has served me well and will continue to do so. Good Car, Average Reliability This car worked well, but we had a number of small issues with it.  The drivers side window repeatedly slipped off the track, the transmission has been not shifting as crisp as it should.  Its a good car if you get on that has been taken care of.  Handles well, but there is a lack of power.  AWD system works great in MN winters.  Would buy this car again, but make sure the timing belt has been changed!!! If it isn\\'t, you can bend a valve and it will be $3000 later before it will be back on the road.   11 years old still great This car is now 11 years old and it still drives great.  It has 128,000 miles on it and still feels like new.  The interior holds up well as does the exterior body and paint.  It handles great in snow and ice.  Repairs are very costly on these cars.  I think reliablity is better than a lot of american cars but comes nowhere close  to a Honda or Toyota.  I\\'ve have to replace 2 controls arms, which was a common problem with these early models.  I replaced the clutch after 60  miles which seems pretty weak to me.  As far as routine maintenance the most expensive is 90k miles about $1000. The Dream Car From the first day that I test drove the Audi I fell in love with it. Performance, luxury and comfort were all as promised. It\\'s very fun to drive and exterior is a work of art. Thanks Audi for making great cars year after year.  Expensive Bought for 5k, over 3k spent on ball joints (bad design), tie-rod ends, sway bar links, steering rack and hose, lots of money!  Suspension design is a joke with the exception of the struts, never need to replace, stupid stuff can break like my $1780 steering rack/hose installation. Good vehicle for a high roller who can afford to be robbed on parts and labor. So far, so good I bought this car new in 1997 and has thankfully been very reliable. Around 1997 I lowered the car with new springs and shocks but otherwise left it stock. Just changed the timing belt a year ago, but other than that no major mechanical issues. I changed the brake pads myself around 60,000 miles (the easiest and fastest brakes I\\'ve ever done). The exhaust finally rusted out by the flextube so I\\'ve installed a new Borla exhaust. Great drive, still feels full of quality, no rust, paint looks new after a wash. No regrets buying this car. Great Car Great car, suspension is fantastic, although the exterior is ok. It can be easily spiced up a bit by adding an RS4 body kit. They will then look fantastic. Outstanding car for the miles that are on mine, 101000. Poor quality car Like our Audi A6, the A4 is very unreliable after 50K miles. In the last 11 months we have paid over $4K in repairs (engine 3x, ignition key). They are fun to drive, but with such an unreliable nature and high-maintenance cost, they are not very attractive cars any longer. Great Car...Just take care of it!! This has been an excellent car for the past 9 years.  It is just crossing over the 95000 mile mark and it still drives like a new car.  As long as you take care of the car it should live nicely.  The car is a bit delicate in that it doesn\\'t respond nicely to adverse situations.  The check engine light is bound to come on for any little reason.  Maintenance is expensive.  The only major problem I have had was with the transmission.  At the 7 year mark the transmission had to be totally replaced.  My mechanic (a German car specialist) indicated this was a common problem with this style transmission. 10 year old car feels like New I have 150k and it really does feel like a new A4. The Quattro is a must for MN winters. The interior layout is perfect in the front. The rear is very tight. The repairs are expensive, but you can buy parts online and you really can do it your self. It\\'s easier than my Jeep to work on. I\\'ve done brakes, wheel bearings, and plugs.  When you find one you like, call the local Audi dealers with the VIN to see if they have serviced it. They will tell you everything that has been done. The back of the owners manual has space for service stations to stamp. If you want to upgrade the motor in any way, don\\'t get the 12valve V6! Their is NOTHING available. Go for the turbo. The V6 is more dependable Amazing This is the best car I have ever owned.  Driving it is a dream.  The 5 speed manual is like butter.  The acceleration in good, but won\\'t snap any necks. Handling is amazing.  The quattro is a masterpiece.  Living in Colorado, all wheel drive is important, and I have never slipped on ice once. These cars don\\'t hold their value well because of reliability concerns, but they are an absolute bargain.  The only problem I\\'ve had is the air sensor ($350), which is basically routine maintenance. If something does go wrong, it can be costly though because some parts are only available through audi. This car gives the performance and comfort a of a car 3 times its price and is still way ahead of its time This is German engineering???? Fun to drive.  Not fun to service.   Belt tensioner went south at 60K, ($700 repair)  ECM at 70K ($600 repair) plus electrical and AC problems.  Recommended service always on time at a independent Audi shop.  Parts should not be failing at this rate.  Audi service manager said that these vehicles exhibit problems, and listed about 10.  Suggested I buy a 2005 A4.  My company cars (Ford, Chevys) are more reliable though not as fun to drive.  OK, we\\'re selling this A4 and buying a new 06 Civic.  Fun to drive, tight body, go kart handling etc.  Not worth the $$$ to replace poorly designed components.  You can get the same performance looks etc., in other cars. Great car overall This is my 1st Audi and definately not the last. Its awesome on the interstate as well as on short in-town trips. In the snow, I think it handles better than the AMTRAK.  Seriously, on snow/ice/wet pavement, the car grips like nothing else, even on regular summer tires. Kind of costly when repairs are needed but its expected on all higher end brands, MB is not cheaper. Just remember this is not a Pontiac or Ford where anyone can work on it. V6 engine could use a little more horses but its just enough and very quiet. I travel a lot and I am always on a rental car. I cannot wait til I get back to my Audi, everytime. It never fails. Like but trouble Great car to drive.  Can not beat it in snow with 4 snow tires.  Many problems with repairs.  Front end parts, electronics, leaks, trans.   Will not get another German car they are very nice but too many expensive repairs.   fun little machine I bought my A4 at 3 years old, and have run it up to 116,000 miles.  It has been incredibly dependable; but repairs aren\\'t cheap.  The car always gives me plenty of (usually audible) signs that something needs attention.  I have had to replace the CD player and all the ball joints...other than that, it has been great. Must be Wealthy Bought my Audi A4 1.8T in 2000.  The \\rcar was great, and it is so much fun \\rto drive.  It is a pleasure to drive \\rin the snow.  However, some how after 50,000\\rmiles or so.  I started hearing some rattling. The \\rdealerhips have no customer service, \\rand they are really rude. They charge \\ryou thousands of dollars for parts and \\rlabor charges that sometimes are more \\rexpensive than the super expensive \\rparts.  Then you get electrical \\rproblems that cost $1,500 each to fix.  \\rBe prepared to spend a lot of money in \\rmaintaining this car.  And even then \\rsometimes I think was it worth it?  \\rRight now going between a G35 or a new \\rA4. My Third Quattro - Highly Recommended This is my 3rd Audi Quattro (4000Q and \\r90Q) that I have had for more than \\r100,000 miles.  I have been very happy \\rwith every aspect of the car.  After \\r100,000 miles it runs and looks \\rgreat.  The performance and gas \\rmileage have only IMPROVED as the \\rmileage piled up.  The Quattro system \\r(and heated leather seats) easily \\rconquers anything a New England winter \\rcan throw at me (and I live in the \\rmountains).  Spectacular! I had a blue adui a4 and i loved it, it \\rwas like my little go kart, becuase it \\rwas so fun to drive. I liked the layout \\rof the interior, but i wish the \\rbackseat was bigger.  I was also very \\rpleased with the reliability.  All in \\rall, i recomend this car to anybody who \\ris looking for a small, reliable, and \\rfun to drive automobile. Fabulous Choice! This car is a great choice for anyone \\rlooking for a medium sized 4 door \\rsport sedan. Great for the younger \\rmarket. Price is excellent for the \\ramount and quality of vehicle that you \\rget. At 7 years old my vehicle is in \\rgreat condition and runs like a dream. \\rThe get up and go is amazing, unlike \\rother sports cars of its age. Great Mountain Car if you can afford it I love this car!  I bought it used at \\r85k miles and have a 117000 now. It\\'s \\rsmooth, good pep- not a barn burner, \\rbut adequate. The naturally asperated \\rFI V6 is very nice. The car is solid \\rlike a Benz and has a strong hint of \\rPorche in it. It\\'s a cat in the snow. \\rThe wheels never spin-never! I recently \\rbought a 2004- I like it even more! \\rRepairs are expensive- It\\'s cheaper to \\rlease a new one covered in warranty, \\rthen to keep pouring big bucks into the \\rold babe- Nothing lasts for ever... not impressed the worst 33 thousand i\\'ve ever spent  A4 1.8t quattro (97) Driven 3,500 miles so far not bad on gas\\ron long trips averaged 28 mpg, but\\raround city down around 20-21. Nice ride\\rand awesome in the snow. Car was built\\rvery nice and a good price! My A4 I have been more than impressed with \\rmy A4\\'s outstanding interior, smooth \\rgood looks, exceptional build quality \\rand ride.  It has generous trunk space \\rand front seats are very comfortable, \\raltho rear passengers lack legroom.  \\rIt\\'s also quite affordable!  The 1.8 \\rturbo with 5 speed stick delivers \\rsmooth power (no noticeable lag) and \\renough horses to run with V6s.  I\\'ve \\rbeen disappointed with reliability, \\rneeding to replace headlight bulbs \\rrepeatedly, and the rack & pinion \\rsteering system.  While the ride is \\rnice, I\\'d prefer it stiffer for \\renthusiastic driving, but replacing \\rthe tires with some Kumhos vastly \\rimproved it. Great driving year after year This car has outstanding handling, \\racceleration, and road worthiness.  It is a joy \\rto drive under any conditions - in town or \\ropen road.  The one drawback to the design is \\rthe limited leg room in the back seat which \\rwas improved somewhat in the newer model.  \\rLike any high performance car, it is not cheap \\rto repair but the driving pleasure it offers \\roffsets that negative. Buy it if you know how to fix it.... Audi is a very fun car to have.  I love  Lovin My Audi A4 This car is the greatest car I have \\rever owned. It is a very beautiful \\rcar! It has all the fine german \\rdetails and enginering that will make \\rthis car last forever. It has been \\rvery reliable for me, and gets great \\rgas milege. The quattro is AWESOME! I \\rget compliments everywhere i go in my \\rA4.  :D Control Arms The vehicle was okay until 90,000 miles \\rwhen it started to have front end problems.  \\rThe control arms of which there are 8 cost \\raround $3200 to fix.   Also, the suspension \\ris costly to get fixed.   97\\' A4 2.8L Quattro-Automatic Great car, very solid, even after 75K \\rmi, going over RR crossings/potholes, \\rbarely hear anything.  Fun car to \\rdrive, especially on wet with the \\rQuattro.  Beautiful exterior-IMHO, one \\rof the best looking models Audi ever \\rcame out with. \\rRepairs Req: Below average, minimum \\rrepairs needed as long as you provide \\renough TLC & good preventive \\rmaintenance. TIP: For parts use VW \\rPassat, most parts exchangeable & \\rcheaper.\\r\"Bad\" Points: Extremely expensive \\rmaintenance & repairs, hard to find \\rparts & shops to work on it other than \\rAudi dealers. If you take good care of \\rit though it will return the favor.\\rWould definetly recommend as a good \\rbuy. Ouch! Talk about everything going wrong...   Audi A4 1.8T 1997 It was love at first sight and I have \\rnever lost my desire to get in and just \\rdrive.  The A4 has proven to be \\rcomfortable in all aspects \\rof seating and visual line of sight as \\ra driver.  The car is aggressive in \\rcorners and commands the roads in all \\rpossible conditions.  Even with this \\rsmall turbo engine, acceleration is \\rquick and prompt.  No wondering when \\rthe power will become available as you \\rstep down on the peddle.  As far as \\rmechanical issues, none.  After seven \\ryears I just did the brakes for the \\rfirst time.  Finally, the car is a \\r1997, and the sytling still turns heads \\rand warm smiles of respect. \\r   Great Audi If taken care of. This car was my first Audi. I am very \\rpleased that the car was taken care of \\rby the first owner, which made it a \\rwhole lot better looking.  I love the \\rquattro. The only problem is that for \\ra v6 there is not a whole lot of \\rpower, but then again your powering \\rall 4 wheels. The traction and \\rhandling are GREAT. VERY PLEASED. But \\rthe Germans forgot that some Americans \\rlive in the heat and not in the snow \\rso It has a tough time cooling itself \\rdown. The only thing that I did not \\rlike were the strips of plastic/metal \\ron each door. They rot away easily and \\rare a $100 to replace. But a great car. Lease a new Audi not a new one I was very excited to get this car at \\rfirst.  For the first year and a half I \\rloved it then things went horribly \\rwrong.  Even though the car was \"Audi \\rAssured\" the oil pump went out because \\rit was not maintained properly before I \\rgot it.  Thus causing the oil pump, \\rturbo (twice), cam, and head to fail \\rtotalling $7K in repairs.  Plus the \\rdealer I took it to, Jordan Motors in \\rDes Moines Iowa took over a month to \\rfix it.  Then I got in to a small \\rcollision and it was over $6K just to \\rfix it.  Don\\'t buy this car or any car \\rfrom them unless you can get it fixed \\rfor free.  Even then don\\'t buy anything \\rfrom them.  Beware of Timing Belt Nightmare!!! I was so excited to purchase my Audi. \\rNow, I can\\'t wait to sell it ASAP. I \\rhave had very expensive repairs, \\rextensive headaches, and extraordinary \\rPOOR customer service.  \\rI specifically asked if timing belt \\rshould be changed at 60,000 miles. I \\rwas told \"NO, manual states 90,000.\" I \\rwas driving 70mph and my timing belt \\rcompletely blew at 61,000 miles and I \\ralmost lost my life when the car \\rstopped suddenly. Audi refuses to \\rassist in any way (or show concern), \\reven though the part was found to be, \\ressentially, defective. Very expensive \\rrepair. Buyer Beware! I \\rhave been contacted about a pending \\rclass action lawsuit for this.\\r Great Car This was my third Audi and I loved it.  \\rGood power, great brakes, and a sweet \\rride. Fun and sporty, but small Before I bought my Acura TL this was my \\rfavorite daily driver.  I really \\renjoyed owning my A4 1.8TQM and \\rregretted that I never \\'chipped\\' it.  I \\rsold it 3 years later to afford my \\rdream home.  I found this car a lot of \\rfun to drive, and raced it in Solo 2 \\r(Autocross) for two seasons.  I also \\rliked the surefooted behavior on snow \\rwhen I took it skiing.  However, I was \\rdisappointed with the service, and \\rencourage owners to keep an eye on \\rfluid and air pressure levels in order \\rto avoid unfortunate, avoidable run-ins \\rwith the dealer. Why did I purchase this car? This is the most absolutely, \\rdispisable vehicle I have owned in all \\rmy life! I have had to replace the \\rheater core $1,400 job, tape player, \\rthe muffler,throttle body $600, \\rignition switch, power switch, brakes \\r& rotors, $1,000, turbo $1,000, oil \\rpump, something with the suspension & \\rsteering, and six lights. All of this, \\rin the 2 1/2 years I\\'ve had the car. This car is a major disappointment Always trusted German engineering and \\rreliability, but this car is a \\rcomplete disappointment. Regular \\rmaintenance and repairs would cost you \\ran arm and a leg. Audi dealerships are \\rnot the best to deal with. My car\\'s \\rengine CRACKED at 80K (no hard \\rdriving) and the dealership had no \\ridea that it cracked but suggested a \\rwhole list of other repairs. Paid them \\rfor the useless repairs and at the end \\rthey simply told me that a new engine \\ris what I needed.  \\'97 A4 It\\'s been a good daily use car.  The \\rcar feels solid, however at 60k+ it\\'s \\rgetting a couple minor rattles.  The \\rdealer\\'s costs for repairs are \\rexcessive, this is the only reason I \\rmay not buy another one.  When the car \\ris cold it\\'s slugish, but it warms up \\rquickly.  I would probably spend the \\rextra money for the V6 next time.  \\rHowever the 1.8T is a great 4 cyl. Good buy Bought my A4 two years ago, and bought \\ran extended warrenty.  I had the turbo \\rreplaced under warrenty- I was happy to \\rhave it.  The AWD is great for Michigan \\rwinters, and the rust protection seems \\rto be very good.  I plan on keeping \\rthis car for a while. Great Value This car has been great to own. I have \\rexperienced none of the mechanical \\rfailures reported by other edmunds.com \\rowners. It drives great and looks \\rbeautiful. After a car wash, people \\rthink its brand new. It was a great \\rbuy considering the cost of a 3-series \\rof the same year. worst car i have ever owned costly mainteance nightmare. thus was  Think Twice Before You Buy My car has 80k miles.  It is important \\rfor the buyer to know what they are \\rgetting into.  It will require repairs, \\rbut prepare to go to an Audi dealer \\ronly and pay $125 p/ hour, or more.  \\rEx: Power locks went out shortly after \\rI purchased the car, ($650!) Now needs \\ra new water pump, (a $30 part,) but to \\rhave the dealer put it on would cost  \\r$550!  It\\'s ridiculous.  Only an Audi \\rdealer can change the oil light every \\r3k miles, so prepare to pay for that.  \\r(The servicing light is the same way!)  \\rIt\\'s a very nice car to drive, but \\rthink twice before you buy.  Make sure \\ryou have the money to burn.  I don\\'t. Augusta A4 - More fpg than any sports sedan \\ravailable\\r- precie and predictable handling, even \\rwhen going deep\\r- the auto-tranny is surprisingly good, \\reven downshifts well\\r- RED! Not a Toyota :)  This was my first Audi, 5 years and I\\rstill love it. The only things negative\\rwere the remote fobs are junk and the \\rcost for anything is way too high, a\\rnew key was $60 and the transducers\\rdon\\'t even do anything in 97. Tried German Once - Once Puchased a Certified Used Audi A4 - 1.8 \\rturbo to experience some German \\rEngineering.  Unfortunately, \\rEngineering was the problem, as the \\rvehicle lost both a timing belt \\rprematurely causing $4K in damage, and \\rthen the transmission gave out as well \\rfor another $5K.  The car had less than \\r80K miles at the time of both, and the \\rcar was well maintained with one \\rowner.  After contacting Audi, none of \\rthe items were covered under the \\rwarranty, because they were \\rconsidered \"wear items\", so the charges \\rwere all out of pocket expenses.  Never \\ragain. 80K mile car!? You\\'re crazy..... .....you need to take better care of \\ryour car. I bought my 1.8T with 70K \\rmiles almost 2 years ago, it now has \\r101K miles. I am happy to say that I \\rhave not had a single problem with it. \\rI\\'ve changed the battery and done the \\r100K tune up. That\\'s it. My next car \\rwill be an Audi. A new one. A4 IS ONLY GOOD FOR 80,000 MILES I\\'ll never buy one again!!  0 - 80000 \\rmiles the A4 ran perfectly.  On its \\r80000m birthday huge problems.  Major \\roil leak hear, broken gasket there, \\rusual timing belt replacement, cracked \\rheating pipe under there, electric \\rswitch on transm failure, etc., etc., \\retc.  In a 3 month period, I averaged \\rclose to $3k in car repairs and it has \\rnever run the same.  Don\\'t plan on \\rkeeping the A4 for longer than 5 \\ryears, unless you want it in the shop \\rfor 4 weeks each year while the dealer \\rcomplains it cannot get parts from \\rGermany or back East.  Goodbye Audi, \\rhello Infinity, Lexis, Honda. Fun to drive, easy to own I\\'ve owned this car for nearly 2 years, and it has been a dream. The interior is plush and relaxing, but no adult human can fit in the back seats. Ample trunk space. The Bose sound system isn\\'t too bad. Excellent Car This has been an excellent car for us.  My wife loves to drive it and feels very, very safe in it.  Very fun to drive in the snow too!  We have had no major problems with it and have put 140,000 miles on it.  The igntion switch went bad, but that was covered by Audi.  We originally used Oasis as our Repair shop in Redding, CA, but now use University Audi in Seattle, WA.  Both shops know the and fix the cars well. GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY! Do not plan to own this car without a warranty!  In the four years I\\'ve had it, I\\'ve had to replace: radio x3, ignition switch X2, starter X2, water pump, clutch master cylinder and numerous pieces of interior trim that can\\'t seem to hold onto their paint. I can\\'t buy another Audi, though I love the look and feel of this car. Save yourself before it\\'s too late. Cupholders Please Bought this vehicle on the Audi Assured program.  A very reliable and a great car.  It is fun to drive...but have a few complaints.  1st, oil changes at the dealership are expensive ($65 to $100) and required to maintain the warranty.  2nd, the cupholders are AWEFUL!  Note to Audi...Americans like to drink beverages when they drive.  The 2 excuses for cupholders on this car will hold a can of soda, and thats it...Other than that, great car that runs smooth and never fails me in the snow. Audi is a pain and Don Rosen is not good After owning the A4 for only 3 1/2 years, the transmission had to be replaced.  This repair could have been made earlier and saved the transmission, but because of a misdiagnosis by Don Rosen it resulted in the total destruction of the transmission.  In addition, had the reported problems been diagnosed properly when I reported them it would have been covered under warranty.  Luckily, I was able to talk Don Rosen into covering half the cost, but it still cost me $2500. Audi A4 Repairs can be expensive but that comes with the Audi brand and technology. I love my Audi A 4 the driving experience is excellent! It is a reliable car as long as you keep up the maintenance . stay away 2006 a4 cabrio s line. this car suck .. its not reliable at all . I have 95000 miles on it and every 2 months something break or stop working . the parts are crazy expensive. the material that the interior is made of are cheap and dont last at all.  the car  feels cheap all over .. my 2000 bmw with 180000 miles had way way way less problems than the audi and still going strong . I really regret buying audi. 2nd owner of this wonderful vehicle I bought this car with 45K miles on it as a 2nd home car for Arizona.  I had an A4 convertible in NJ, a 2007, and loved it.  I love this car too.  Great pickup and go, been a great car (now with 67K miles on it).  Car looks almost new as I get it detailed inside and out every year in AZ.  The only problem are the cloudy headlights which I\\'d like to get remedied. Bad audi Bad Audi the first week. The engine noise sound like a diesel engine. Battery dead after 2 yrs. Misc. Controls and knobs stop working. When top down the driver window rattles. I think I bought a lemon. Brought to the dealer. They said the engine noise was normal. They didn\\'t do nothing with the window.  Sudden acceleration!!! I was stopped by a light ready to make a left turn, foot on the brake-car in drive as always. Suddenly the engine started to re to what seemed like the redline. Brakes barely held so I immediately put the car into neutral and stepped on the accelerator to quiet the engine. It worked but I just missed hitting the car in front by about 2 feet. Had it flatbedded to Audi who (even after a technician came) couldn\\'t find anything wrong. If it happened once it will happen again. No carpet issue. I love this car and wish they would have found something. Reported to nhtsa who will investigate. Happen to anyone else? This is a major accident waiting to happen. Be very careful my friends. Best Car Out There If there were a stability award for most stable convertible on the road, then the A4 cabriolet would win it! I loved driving my cabriolet, especially because I live in Florida. I had a couple problems with it, but other than that, it was perfect. I recommend this car for someone who is looking for a sports luxury compact convertible all in one, for a reasonable price. I especially like the interior design.  A fun and smart car to drive! It\\'s sleek and strong, fitting my personality to a tee!  Excellent handling and zooming in and out of traffic is a breeze in the sport gear. Also gets great gas mileage for such a sporty vehicle.   Enjoying the Florida Sun! Great fun to drive, especially the handling and overall ride comfort.  The fuel economy is an added bonus for this car. Traded 99 Boxster for this - love it so  Started having maint issues with Porsche... wanted something with convert., good warranty, luxury, and the scheduled maint is still included thru \\'06. Fun in the sun!!! Excellent Fuel economy with 1.8t  Runs the sames numbers as the 3.0 because of the added weight.  Beautiful inside and out. Great Car This car is very fun to drive.  It handles well. Great interior/exterior fit and finish. Seats are firm and comfortable.  Controls and instruments are easy to read and user friendly. Performance is a bit unresponsive when first starting up from a stop while in Drive.   neilsaudi Having driven a Porsche Boxster S for four years, I did not think that I would enjoy the A4 as much.  I am so glad that I am wrong.  The A4 drives like a dream.  It is comfortable and handles well.  It is no slouch in the passing lane and performs just as well in the city as it does on the highway.  The trunk is unusually roomy for a convertible.  The styling and instrumentation is second to none.  The fit and finish are superior.  Even the basic Symphony sound system with nine speakers is more than adequate.  I got the Premium package with my vehicle and love all its components (xenon headlights, electronically adjustable passenger\\'s seat, etc.)  I am breaking in my A4 and love its mpg, too Love this car!! I\\'ve had so many people come up to me saying how much they love the looks of my car.  I\\'ve been so happy with it.  I love that it tells me when I need to bring it in for service, since I\\'m a complete \"auto-illiterate.\"   Fun, fast car It is a fun and very fast car.  Very eye apealing and turns many heads on the road.  Only down side is the turbo doesn\\'t kick in till about 2,500 RPM\\'s so it has a delay for a second in take off speed once you hit the gas.  But as soon as the Turbo kicks in it makes up for it. Audi A4 1.8T Compared the BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Toyota for value.  The Audi offers the greatest bang for our buck.  With the top up you would not even know that you are in a convertible.  Very quiet on the highway.  Excellent backseat for our 5 and 6 year old.  Other than turbo lag at the bottom end, she is an excellent performer. Love it! I test drove the 3.o but couldn\\'t justify the extra 10k for the additonal power. The 1.8 is slow off the line but at about 30 you can feel the turbocharger spin up and it feels like a 6 cyl. The fit and finish are excellent and the Audi offers features that the Volvo, BMW and Saab didn\\'t. I\\'m 6\\'2\\' and it fit\\'s like a glove, although it has less leg room in the back than the Volvo. My wife and I (by rights it\\'s her car) fight over it everyday... starting to feel like that commercial! Avants are great...Audi must bring the S4/RS4! Well designed, comfortable, back seat in the older models not as space efficient as it should be for legroom. Do Not Trust Sometimes locks doors when I exit car, even w/ motor running, which should be impossible. Once refused to shift down while passing a car and refused to accelerate in any selected gear except \"Drive.\" Revs would peak at 4k, even with accelerator planted firmly to firewall. Tried every possible position of gear selector and punched the accelerator to downshift during 50 miles of freeway driving, to no avail. After shutdown, no problem. Do not trust this car. Dealer\\'s tech indicates he never heard of such a problem. Dealer is 200 miles distant, and tech doubts problem can be diagnosed, since no warning lights were lit.  Awesome Vehicle This vehicle has been everything I\\'ve expected and more. On most of my highway trips (usually 800 miles each way) I average around 30mpg and that\\'s crossing the Rocky Mountains. The performance of the 2.0T is great for a 4cyl.  Rarely do I have to shift out of 6th gear in order to pass or go up a grade. The interior is very comfortable and well laid out.  The fit & finish is amazing, as expected from an Audi. Overall, I can\\'t say this car is perfect but any of it\\'s slight nuances are easily overshadowed by everything else.   Better than many sports cars For this empty-nester, the A4 Avant is great for cross country trips for two with lots of stuff.  30+ mpg on trips, 27 overall.  The 6-spd manual is rare in an Avant, but it\\'s great fun when combine with sports suspension.  At occasional track days, this fuddy-duddy station wagon can stay with some expensive sports machines.  About all this car isn\\'t good at is sneaking up on pedestrians, as direction injection engine has an almost-diesel clatter. Unsafe Transmission Owned an Audi 5000CS during the unintended acceleration scare years.  Fun to drive but a nightmare with repairs.  Waited all these years to buy an Audi A4 wagon.  Great design and overall build.  However, had to have it towed after it died in the middle of an intersection.  Supposed bad fuel pump sensor. Under warranty.  Much bigger problem is the transmission (new design) that hesitates between 1st, 2nd and 3rd.  Hesitates so long that it is unsafe when pulling out into traffic, etc.  Dealer said it\\'s the nature of the beast and to change the way I drive.  Can\\'t wait to return car.  Luckily, I only have 9 months left on lease.  Feels unsafe to drive.  Take a long test drive before you buy. Awesome Audi Avant Manual 6 My 2006 Avant 3.2 manual has the premium, s-line, cold and titanium packages. I defected from BMW. This car has great handling with understated looks but still gets stares. The manual shifts crisply and the power through all gears is great. It really pulls through each one when you step on the gas. The only problem so far is an annoying rattle in the dash. Dealer says they charge for labor on rattles after 12k miles. Audi USA says it\\'s covered under warranty. This is the only disappointment on the car. Stereo, Bluetooth are great. I love the dash. The white and red contrast is very sporty and lux. Not your soccer-mom\\'s station wagon It\\'s been 7 months of sheer driving nirvana.  We have an almost fully loaded version.  At first I thought it was silly to have so many add-ons, but honestly can\\'t say I don\\'t appreciate them all now.  I love the S-Line package, very sporty and aggresive looking, soooo sweet on the twisties.  I also love the new larger front grille design.  I wouldn\\'t change a thing on the exterior styling, perfectly sporty yet understated. I wouldn\\'t have a problem recommending this car to anyone.  Coolness for a wagon Wife wanted to downsize from SUV to a wagon. After test driving Subaru and Saab, I convinced her to ignore the price of the Audi A4 Avant 2.0T and test drive it. She loved it. While not much of a wagon fan, I have found I really like driving this semi-sporty little car. I love the sport shift, cornering ability (with 17 inch wheels/tires), and excellent suspension. The little 4 cyl has decent accel power - more than I anticipated. This is our first Audi and we really like it. Interior represents genius design. This Audi Rocks! I test drove several vehicles and ended up purchasing the Audi because it handled better, accelerated as well, got better gas mileage, better interior and trunk space plus it was priced right. I have had several nice cars, but this is by far the best all around car I have ever owned! My 3.2 Avant The Avant A4 3.2 \"S\" Line looks like a normal wagon but it handles like a sports car, specially on a rainy day, it becomes another car with the traction control and Quattro (AWD) makes you feel secure. Audi A4 Avant 2.0T Great car.  6 speed automatic transmission is a little quirky. But the sport transmission feature is fun to drive.  Acceleration is excellent for a 4 cyl engine.  Interior is very quiet, roomy and comfortable.  I don\\'t like the seat belt/door open/headlight alarm.  Very annoying and rather loud. Brake dust is excessive. Other than that, I really enjoy every aspect of the car. Awesome Wagon! I love this car!  We were ready to downsize from an SUV, but still wanted an expanded cargo area.  This fits our needs perfectly.  We looked at the Subarus, but they didn\\'t compare to the Audi. The 6 speed manual transmission shifts smoothly and is fun to drive. All round great wagon.   Wanted a wagon that had style and performance.  The update added a brand new engine (soon to be found on the new Jetta) and the car comes with a great set of luxury features.  Added Premium and Cold Weather Packages, and 17 inch wheels.   Very fun for a \"station wagon\" What a great car! I gave up a \\'98 528i for the Avant... The ride is a bit stiffer than the 528i. Not a major problem.  The A4 has grown up I just traded in my 1999 1.8T (manual) A4 Avant for a 2006 2.0T with an automatic transmission.  They feel like 2 different cars and I love them  both.  The 2006 feels more luxurious and adult-like, but it isn\\'t a floaty car. I feel a tad more removed from the road in the new one but it handles like a dream.   It is a blast to drive on twisty,hilly roads.   It feels so solid too and the brakes are amazing.   I hear the new A3 drives like my old A4.  That makes sense.   2006 audi a4 check engine light always on I owned acura integra,Toyota Corolla and Mitsubishi Lancet evolution 8,driving Japanese cars is much easier, cheap to maintain and check engine light barely turn on. Before I buying any  type of cars i do my research on Edmunds consumer review and how this people rate the 2006 audi a4 \"great car\" is a lie because first year of owing it in had nothing but headaches on repairs and terrible gas mileage on a stock car(normal driving). I do my regular oil change 3k miles,transmission fluid flush at 100k and do most of the repair myself and check engine light never ends, after fixing one thing a different check light codes pops up. I spend $2000 in oem parts within the last 3 years owning it,cam followers,pcv valves,brake booster hoses,spark plugs coil packs all replaced. Interior is also falling apart my glove compartment hinges replaced ,center console arm replaced, passenger back window motor replaced,window button peeling off replaced, rear back seat cup holder won\\'t open i think the spring is damage inside to pop out. Overall this 2006 a4 is garbage and I won\\'t be owing any audi a4 ever again. Really good choice! I bought the car scared of having huge maintenance costs, however. it has cost me less than my Honda Odyssey. All i needed to do were a oil change, tires, and a cracked windshield. Find one well maintained and you\\'ll be set. Drives like a dream. No lights! Finally had to trade the car due to headlights randomly shutting off. Also constant \"check engine\"light. Always seemed to have some issue or problem. 2006 Audi A4 2.0 Turbo Quattro - great car Audi got it right with this car.  I have 187,000 miles on it and it runs/drives great.  Paint is a little chipped from the constant driving and I hit a deer that made a dent in the driver\\'s side door but other than that the car handles great on winding mountain roads and in the snow/rain.  I change the oil every 5000 miles with full synthetic and the engine hums like new.  Only complaint is changing the timing belt and water pump every 100,000 miles ($1600).  I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking to pick up a used car for a teenager. Highly recommended Many people complain about expensive maintenance. If you are like me and do your own maintenance, there is very little you have to do or pay. I have an OBD II computer that I use whenever the check engine light comes on (not often). I bought it with 55,000 miles on it, it now has 87,000. I\\'ve had to replace a coil pack (easy fix, $37 and 1 hour of my own labor), divertor valve ($150, 2 hours labor), and that is all. To change your oil, it is handy if you have the Audi tool ($100) for cartridge style oil filters (you\\'ll have a mess if you don\\'t), but you can make your own pretty easily out of a hose and the right diameter bottle. The car drives absolutely beautifully, couldn\\'t be happier. Original Owner 2006 A4 150k+ Original owner of our Audi A4 2006.  Have done all suggested maintenance at the Audi dealership.  Usually runs an average of $2000 per year.  Other than that, absolutely no trouble whatsoever.   Buyer Beware For all of you that said that if you don\\'t take care of your car then of course you can expect problems, seriously, you should just be sooooo lucky that you go one of the few NON-LEMONS. I have kept my car in mint condition and I have had the ignition coils replaced 5 times! The altenator, crankshaft, Electronic Control Module, Purge Valve, and the transmission is failing. It is now at audi with an estimated repair of 4,500. I bought the car in 2009 and almost instantly had mechanical problems and I bought it as a certified pre-owned. The thing that makes me the most mad is that they are known recalls but will only cover them the first go around. Be ready to fix them over and over.  Fantastic Car I\\'ve had my 2006 A4 for about a year now and it runs like a champ. Had 85k on the odometer and since I\\'ve put another 15k this year. The car is great in every way. It looks great, classy, good performance for a sedan, and very comfy. Also the car its self is very reliable BUT I feel that many previous owners will not take good care of the car. These cars are very picky and need premium fuel, synthetic oil changes, etc. Before you buy make sure the previous owner took care of the car because maintenance and repair costs do add up. This year alone I\\'ve spent about $1500 in maintenance including, transmission fluid, tune up, brakes, fuel cleaning, new turbo etc. But all in all great car! One of my best purchases! I\\'m the 4th owner, and purchased this car after a GREAT deal of researching for 2 weeks.I bought this car in 2011 (it was 5 model years old then) with 54k miles on the clock, and have been pleasantly surprised by its reliability.In the 2 years and 3 months I\\'ve owned my Audi, I\\'ve only spent $300 on service that wasn\\'t routine maintenance.At 72k miles I had to replace the turbo recirculation valve.At the local Audi dealership they replaced several parts that weren\\'t even on a recall and despite the fact that my car was WAY out of warranty...all at no charge, and topped it off with a complimentary car wash and synthetic oil change. Money to blow? If you have money to blow, and you want a flashy, luxurious, thrilling sports car then you need an Audi A4 Quattro. The car is a rock star. HOWEVER: If you don\\'t have a spare $5000 to blow at all times, this car is not for you. Even if you take obsessive care of it, the car will have problems (I\\'m quoting the Audi service rep Britney at Audi Chandler, Arizona). My AC blew out, $2500 to fix.She said it happens all the time!!?? I constantly have to replace interior parts like the glove box cover, dash case, and shift knob compartment.Repairs routinely cost over $1200. Combine with $1200 regular maintenence and you have a serious ethical decision to make. Is it worth it? Not for me. Honda! Very Satisfied I\\'ve read all the gripes about reliability and maintenance costs, and wonder if it\\'s just the owners of the lemons using this forum to let off some steam. Suppose I\\'d do the same, actually, but I\\'ve been really happy with our Audi. Its design is understated, not flashy, almost utilitarian, but very classy. It\\'s stood the test of time well and looks as good as any of the current models. As for reliability, we\\'ve really had no major issues. As NYC drivers, we put the wheels and tires to the test on our pitiful roads, and thus have changed many tires. This is really my only gripe, but that can hardly be blamed on the car. My first car Steering wheel can be heavier but handling is great in general. The brake is sometimes not responsive enough esp when going downhill, but since the brake pads havent been replaced for quite a while already that is perfectly normal & I could tell the brake will be awesome once i get the pads replaced. Engine is a 1.8T but I consider it more than powerful enough for a new driver driving in a small city like HK. I especially love driving it on highways and it is always ready to offer you a pep whenever you need/want it - so overtaking can be done at ease. It runs stably & noise isolation is great.Awesome interior build quality.  Fun to drive, costly to own Original purchaser, just over 5 years with not quite 60k km\\'s/37k mi on it, all easy miles.All maintenance done by Audi per recommended schedule.Great car to drive, but expensive to maintain once OoW.Low oil pressure light/check engine light 1 month out of warranty.Known issue with oil starvation due to sludge requires a complete engine replacement - $12k.Dealer went to bat for me and Audi\\'s covering a portion, but even so, it\\'s more than I spent on my last 2 Ford\\'s with twice the mileage.Clicking noises come from dash when cold due to known issues with actuators.Audi won\\'t cover even though reported under warranty.Even basic service is 2X my Ford/Honda.Costly lesson. Former BMW/MBZ Driver - Now an Audi Driver For the last 15 years I drove a BMW or MBZ, beacause what I like to call \"QUALITY OF DRIVE.\"Downside higher fuel costs & repairs.Another BMW/MBZ is out of the question; as pricing isn\\'t sensible and searched until I was surprised by the quality of the Audi A4.My \\'near-new\\' A4 is as surefooted as my BMW, but tons lighter like my MBZ.Luxury is not lacking but, could be better.What I love the most is both my BMW/MBZ\\'s ran approx 16-21 mpg -- I\\'m now at 30 MPG\\'s in my Audi A4 2.0T and she get\\'s me 500 miles between fill-ups.This is the best of both worlds!Since I also purchased \\'Near New\\' I purchased the extended warranty -- german vehicles can be fickle -- you just never know. Audi\\x92s Life Lesson If I only listened to my friend who begged me not to purchase an Audi after an awful experience, my life would have been much better over the past three years. Twelve check engine lights later and a new transmission,I am here to proclaim that Audi is a nightmare and does not stand by its product. During a three year period, my A4 was in the shop approximately 35 days. Audi is one of the few cars that charge a deductible for part covered under a CPO warranty. I had to shell out $85 per visit, which amounted to $1020 not including tax. If you dare to own an Audi and like misery, I suggest getting a warranty to ease the pain. Although my Audi experience was painful, I learned a life lesson! Very reliable I purchase my A4 2.0T quattro new in 2006. Since then I have driven the car 167,588 miles. I have spent $5,800 so far in maint & repairs including tires. I have followed the maint schedule to the letter except for oil changes. I do the oil & filter every 5000 miles. The car still consistently gets 30-32 MPG. It still has the original shocks and exhaust. it will need it\\'s second timing belt at 190,000. The timing belt is a maitenance item. Handling in the snow is effortless and safe. I am curious as to why so many bad reviews. Maybe the cars were not maintained properly from the start or abused. The bi-zeon lights had been troublesome but the dealer & Audi took care of the issue.  Best value  AWD German car I have 52k miles and my warranty expired over 2 years ago. The only issue I had was a low oil pressure light that was showing once in couple of days. Audi replaced the sensor first, and since it did not fix the problem, they did replaced the oil pump. I had the issue reported to Audi when warranty active, so even my warranty was out for 8 months, they still covered the issue. Will never own an audi again!! I purchased this car as a certified pre-owned vehicle at 26000miles thankful I purchased the warranty. In the 1st week check engine light came on. Few weeks later my fuel pump went out. A couple months later, some valves have failed in the engine. A couple months after that-some hose have melted and caused a check engine light.. Then coil pack. Then transmission. Transmisson again. Fuel pump.. again. Oil pump, engine valves. All in a 1.5 yrs. 70,000 miles now. I\\'m selling this car as soon as I get it back from dealer. Never again! I only drive to and from work on the hwy, scheduled maint always was done, but it was a lemon. No help from dealer, or Audi USA-can\\'t admit there is an issue. Be warned.... I purchased my 06 A4 BRAND NEW. Within 6 months it had to be towed...not once but twice for ignition coil failure. One time I was crossing over a large bridge and the car was chugging the second time I was stuck and the car wouldn\\'t start. It was down hill from there. Oil leaks breather valve went, and a host of other issues. Cost me a fortune (high mileage). I don\\'t appreciate ppl saying things about not taking care of the car. My car was beyond taken care of and it was still in service all the time. STAY AWAY. They will NOT help you or admit theres an issue even though they are aware of all these issues. I traded it in for a honda, and can guarantee it will be more reliable!! Fun to drive but... Good looking, very fast and handles like a dream. Definitely a fun to drive car. In terms of reliability, this is the worse car I\\'ve ever owned. I have to take it to the dealer while it was under warranty at least twice. The oil filter housing (made out of plastic) broke during an oil change and it took nearly a week to receive a new one, which was over a $100. The last moth I had it, it threw \"check engine\" lights for three different issues. For the last one the dealer wanted over $1000 to repair it.I had them clear the light, drove it to the nearest Honda dealership, traded it in, and never looked back... for 61,000 miles, I\\'m disappointed. Shoddy interior quality Initially, I was very happy with my purchase of the Audi A4. With it\\'s AWD, it was the perfect choice for driving in Wisconsin winters. However, four years into my purchase, I am very disappointed because of the shoddy wear of the interior. The glove box has fallen off, and from what I read in Audi forums, this is fairly common and Audi charges big bucks to fix this defect. The leather of the drivers seat has developed cracks. And the hinge on the center console has stopped working.  I previously owned a BMW 318ti for 10 years. Year ten, the interior was just as good as the day I purchased it.  For the money, I was expecting the same quality.  Audi does not deliver. I will return to BMW. Not this one Noisy, bed road holding, not reliable, you will need a private gas station. All the report are advertisements=lies Amazing Amazing car! I have owned Mercedes, BMW and now Audi! And I want to say German\\' cars are the best! And also I want to say to everybody: the Germans car need more care than others! If you not care about your car, you will get a lot of problems! So stop writing bad reviews! Check oil level on every fueling, don\\'t drive you car after starting the engine first time in the morning, wait couple minuets, don\\'t kill engine, and you never get a problems! Super car I really love this car. If you read these people\\'s reviews with their broken down audis, you must understand if you don\\'t take care of your car it will break especially used ones. I get 23 mpg very very low maintenance on the car I couldn\\'t be happier. Never again This car has been nothing but trouble. The check engine light goes on time after time. After 44K miles the car needed a $2200. repair (fuel pump/camshaft) w/ metal shavings in the engine to boot. Last Audi I ever buy. So much fun to drive Best car i have ever owned. 25+ MPG in the city and 30+ MPG on the Highway. Super fun to drive. It\\'s an all around great compact sports car. Very Minor maintenance issues, but there isn\\'t a car out there that doesn\\'t Do not  buy AUDI A4 I may never own another Audi, 10,000 miles over warranty and $11,000 dollars worth of engine problems. I drove this car 25 miles per day only back and forth from work, no hard driving, all interstate. Check engine light came on one day and took to dealer and told $11,000 to fix, need new camshaft, turbo out, and a list of things. I will never own another Audi and this is my second with problems like this, and no help from Audi USA.  Do not buy a used Audi. It will not last Garbage. 49,000 miles new engine needed, probably because of the turbo. Later fuel pressure problems, check engine lights on. If you need a used car, do not buy it. Buy Japanese. Engine Problems Never Ending Bad engine intake valve at 49K. Dealership lost the paperwork & I drove it for a month (& beyond warranty) with the ck engine light on before they got the car fixed. Now 2k out of warranty, 4th cylinder taking in air, bad valve seat, needs new cylinder head & misc. valves.  And now they\\'re telling me the problem is that I\\'m changing the oil & performing maintenance per the manufacturer\\'s instructions & I should co-pay the bill on a pre-existing condition!?  I bought this car new; I am the primary driver; this is my first foreign-made vehicle; If Audi doesn\\'t stand behind its product 100% it will be my last.   2006 3.2 Quattro AT Excellent vehicle.  I drove it from LA to Colorado Springs averaging 28MPG, fast.  Yes, lacking in low end torque but no shortage of passing power.  Dream to drive through the canyons of Utah and Colorado.  Handles very well in icy conditions.   62,000 Miles and the engine is done. What a fun car to drive.  It hugs the road, it whips up to speed in seconds, it sips gas and it looks like a millionaire\\'s car.  Unfortunately at 62,000 miles I just found out the engine needs to be replaced.  Fortunately I purchased the car nine (9) months ago as a certified pre-owned so the work will be covered under their warranty. Safe & Solid Well balanced road manners. The quattro system is amazing in the snow. Very stable on wet roadways. Full size spare tire is a plus. Very comfortable seats. Heating and a/c controls are too complicated. Fit and finish inside and out is of a very high quality. My A4 came with every available option. I have put 98,000 miles on it since I purchased new in 04/2006. Maintenance can be expensive. I get 30mpg average city/highway. Have gotten 36mpg on a long trip. Adaptive xenon headlights are ok but kind of gimmicky. Had to have them replaced under warranty. Timing belt requires replacement at 110,000 miles. I just had mine done at 90,000miles. Cost was $1,600. What a car The precision of the steering, the power of the turbo and overall fun to drive aspect, has revitalized me and given me a reason to love cars again. Definitely not a boring, Lexus and Acura. This is German engineering at its best. A Great Car I have owned my Audi for nearly two years and have put a considerable amount of miles on it. I\\'ve only needed to bring it in once outside of its scheduled maintenance for a minor problem (engine coolant leak). This car is beautifully designed, and drives like a sports car. Handles phenomenally in snowy/icy conditions and like a dream on dry pavement. I\\'m not rich so when I buy a car it\\'s a big deal (I must have spent 6 mos deciding and comparing other vehicles!), but I don\\'t think for the money I could have made a better choice!   I would do it again!!! 18 Months and 35K+ miles later: I would do it again, \"Buy Another Certified Audi Vehicle\". 29MPG Highway occasional better. Incredible in snow of any depth here in Southern WI. Zero Maintenance issues!!!!!! Just replaced the OEM Continental Tires at 60K+ miles. Purchased Ultra High Performance Eagle GT\\'s from Goodyear. Great looking, fun to Drive, head turning vehicle. Everything I had hoped for when buying my first European AWD Car. Be sure to ask about the interest rate for Certified Used, the extended warranty and the service package up to 100K Miles. 12 more months and I\\'m searching for a 2008 or 2009. First Time Owner My husband and I had researched used A4s for the last year, and finally found one with the right features. Because we bought it with under 30k miles and the previous owner had taken exceptional care of it, it feels like a brand new car. The handling is WONDERFUL; the car has the optional sport suspension, and it makes a difference. There is plenty of power, and the the car purrs getting onto the freeway. It\\'s also very comfortable inside, and everything about it feels posh. I\\'m looking forward to driving this car for the next few years! What a car! This car is awesome! I didn\\'t drive much prior to owning this car, but it begs to be driven! I did chip it to get some additional HP and torque, and put on light weight 18\" wheels and ultra high proformance tires to lighten it some but even the stock version was fun to drive! If you buy this car or have a chance to drive it, take it on a canyon road and really push the car! It responds great to tight corners and accelerates like a dream!   Nothing anyone can write will express the true enjoyment you get with this car! Even rush hour traffic is bearable! Quattro is a must! Try it for yourself! Great Car! I bought my A4 used with 29K miles, and it feels like I bought a new car. The 2.0T is more than enough for normal daily driving. The CVT took a little getting used to, but now I love the smooth shifting it provides. The interior is very classy. Overall, this car makes me want Audis for the rest of my life. Awesome car I love this car. I love everything about it. Nice ride, very good in gas, comfortable driving. I like it more than BMW325 and some other BMW. Just a fun car to drive. Buy one and you will not regret. I am thinking of trading it in for a new A4.  Certified 2006  I picked up a 2006 A4 2.0T with all the bells and whistles and I love it. It handles wonderfully, it wants to be driven fast and in tight spots. I have wanted an A4 since the 2005.5 was introduced. The style and comfort make me smile everytime! I finally enjoy driving everyday.   I will never drive a two wheel drive vehicle again (I live in Michigan). 2006 Audi A4 The 6 spd transmission and the 2.0L  engine are totally made for each other, I am getting 37 mpg (7.6L/100km) with commute type driving, which is far better that I expected. I traded an 06 Jetta TDI for this, which would give me 6.2L/100km (45 mpg). But now that diesel is $1.06/L and regular is $.94/l, (yes you can run 87 octane) my cost per KM for fuel is only 2 cents more and I get killer traction with Quattro and Hakapelita that defies description. The car needs more little storage places like the Jetta and an arm rest that can be used along with two cups of Timmy\\'s in the holder.  This is a driver\\'s car, and worth every penny. Very Happy With the A4 Went to Dealership to test drive a 2005 allroad.  I never owned a sedan in my life, and I just assumed I would be attracted to something larger.  They had a 2006 3.2 A4 Quattro (Auto w/Triptronic) and an S4 as well.  The Allroad was great, a little too broken in though.  I drove the 2006 A4 and was immediately comfortable.  It was tight, fast, and the interior didn\\'t feel as small as I thought it would be.  Got it with 23,000 miles, with just about every option except nav, which I hate anyway.  This car suits me perfectly.  The perfect balance of power, safety, style, and performance. My First Audi I have owned an Acura, 2 Hondas, a Volvo, Chevy Blazer, and 2 Land Rover Discoverys and now an Audi. Based on my experience so far, I will hopefully own nothing but Audis going forward. This is a wonderful car. Build quality and fit and finish are superb. I have never felt safer in any car. Even with the 2.0 litre engine, acceleration is very spirited (even though there is some hesitation at take-off) and I find myself cruising well above the legal limit without even realizing it. Living in the mid-Atlantic area, I was hesitant to give up 4WD from my Land Rover, so quattro was a major factor in choosing the Audi. Looked at the 3-Series BMW, but the Audi is a much more impressive vehicle. Dissatisfied audi owner I\\'ve own this car for about a year and a half now.  So far this car has been in the shop for more than 7 times due to multiple recalls that I was never notified and malfunctions. One recall I was in total shock was the airbag, it was not functioning and I never got a recall letter until I had to get a letter of recalls for importing my car to Canada. The engine ignition had problems, the valve got disconnected after a few thousand miles, and my car would do this  horrid shaking (I thought I was in an earthquake).  What else, now the suspension is squeaking.  This should not be happening to a car of this price.  I will never buy audi again.   A Great Automobile My beauty is Moro Blue with beige interior. Options include premium pkg, technology pkg, sport pkg, vavona birch trim, Bose XM stereo. This is my second A4, the first was an Amulet Red 2002 1.8T w/manual shifter (I miss that color, wish it was still available). So Cal\\'s stop and go traffic necessitated my first automatic in 27 years. Although I miss a manual at times, I love the CVT\\'s seamless shifting. After 17 months of truly enjoyable driving, this car has been flawless and it seems to get better with each mile driven. The car adapts to your driving style and fits like a glove.  I love passing those monster SUVs getting 12 mpg, while I\\'m averaging 35 mpg! This A4 is a great automobile. I Love This Car I have the 2.0 Quattro with a 6 spd and every option offered at the time.  This car is a lot of fun to drive and certainly has more than enough power.  Rock solid in the curves, even at high speed.  The new 2007 navigation update made some changes to the radio that I am not crazy about.  My car has 15,000 miles and is still a great ride.  Just traded it though on a 2007 2.0 cabriolet.  I have had many Audi cars going back to 1974 and they get better all the time. Brain Washed by Audi! After months of comparison (IS 250, 3 series, MB C230, and G35), I finally settled on the A4, and have looked back with no regrets.  This car is phenomenal to drive - it hugs off ramps and high speeds, the seats are supportive and comfortable on long trips, and the interior design is top notch.  I purchased mine with a red exterior and a black / silver interior and it\\'s eye catching!  I also ordered mine with the sport suspension, which is great for windy road driving.  The 4 cyl Turbo produces excellent HP.  And for what you\\'re getting in a car (entry level luxury sport), you\\'re getting a lot more bang with your buck compared to the 3-series.  I will come back to Audi for my next car. Audi excellent vehicle Ten days after getting my car I drove from Florida to Canada, I didn\\'t have any problems. I enjoy driving this car so much that  it only took me two days, I only stopped to eat and for fuel. This car is the best. BMWs are also beautiful cars but I like this car more because it shows more prestige and is more elegant. I can\\'t wait for the B8 model. One of the BEST I did a lot of research on BMW, Lexus, Audi and US models. Settled on the Audi because of the quattro system, performance, and build quality. I have owned the vehicle for one year with no issues and it is still exciting to drive, outstanding on snow and ice. You can\\'t go wrong on this one. Fun AWD sedan with sporting qualities I\\'ve loved my Audi since the day I picked it up.  Build quality of the vehicle is amazing and the interior is top notch.  The full time AWD system is great in any type of weather.  It especially compliments the manual transmission providing little to not slip off the line.  Engine is powerful and pulls like a v-6.  Only thing I would change would be to order the S-Line sports package.  You get the looks of the more expensive S4.   Audi A4 2.0T - Poor Gas Mileage The gas mileage is worse than a V8 Ford F150 loaded. Ford truck 19 mpg hgwy, Audi A4 16-17 mpg hgwy!! Don\\'t by the CVT, you cannot accelerate smoothly from a stop, it hesitates and then BAM, it lunges, especially on a ramp in a parking structure or making a left turn, nice! You cannot use the center console because it interferes with the hand brake, lovely. The brakes chatter when slowing from ~50 mph, e.g. coming down an off-ramp from the freeway. Absolutely the worst car I\\'ve ever owned. Don\\'t buy an Audi. I had to find SOMETHING wrong... ...but the only thing that comes to mind is the shark fin antenna.  I love the layout of the interior, the steering wheel controls, the clutch is great, I got the sports suspension and it\\'s fine for everyday use, but when I go to the mountains, it really shines!  I\\'ve never had a car with dimming side view mirrors, and I\\'ve got to say, that feature works so well. As for how the car drives, I\\'ve been driving my car for 8 months now, and recently drove a friend\\'s civic.  It\\'s crazy how spoiled you be come when you drive an audi.  The car behaves SO much better at 80 mph on the freeways than something like a honda. In short, I love everything about this car. Outstanding for a 4cyl Excellent machine! Always wanted an Audi, don\\'t know why I waited so long. I\\'ve owned other German made vehicles and the Audi is far superior!  I believe I\\'ve found my car of choice for future purchases.  Totally sold.   Practical and fun to drive Second A4 I\\'ve owned and this one is a lot more fun to drive.  2.0T is a great engine, lots of pep despite a little turbo lag. Have been averaging almost 28 mpg. Handling is great, very responsive.  Have had a few electrical problems, but still love the car.  Can\\'t get it away from my wife!  Back seat a little tight, but great trunk space.  Nav system takes some getting used to, not as intuitive as my wife\\'s MDX. Really like the satellite radio and the whole sound system. Overall very satisfied. One year and 22,000 miles later I\\'ve had my A4 now just over a year and have put 22,000 miles on it; half of which were driving back and forth fom DC to NY in lousy winter weather.  The car is so good, the only reason I will ever own another is if and when I splurge on an S4.  I had heard mixed reviews about the last generation of A4s reliabilty.  Well, I have not had a single problem.  Handling, traction, steering and control are out of this world.  I often travel and end up renting other cars; it\\'s amazing how less secure I feel in them compared to the A4. Flawless at 15,000 Miles Mechanically there have been zero problems.  The car has performed nicely.  Last week, pulling into an intersection I was within three meters of being broad sided by a car running through the red light at high speed.  I punched the gas pedal and the car\\'s AWD gripped the road allowing the 2.0 Liter Turbo to haul me out of harms way, permitting the other car to screech around and behind mien Audi.  My life, or quality thereof, was saved by this car.   Overrated Ive had my Audi for months. Already had to get 1 headlight replaced. It shifts horribly, squeaky interior, at high speeds I get rattles from the dash very annoying. I\\'m glad it\\'s a lease, no more Audi for me. Only good thing is the looks and design. Build quality is awful. I have every option to include titanium pkg. Seats are a bit uncomfortable, back seat space is minimal. No power for 2.0T. Oh and they don\\'t use real leather seats. 2006 A4 2.0T Pleasurable drive, superior standard engine, a great deal compared to a BMW 325i, and in addition it gets better fuel economy (25 city/ 32 highway) than a 3-series. What more could you ask for? All around value I had a 98 Passat with the 1.8T. After putting 165K miles on that car I knew the 2.0T would be a winner. I wasn\\'t wrong. For all around handling, interior comfort, looks, luggage space and performance, you would be hard pressed to find a better value. The car is glued to the road and handles slippery weather. I chose this car based on these factors: MPG, all wheel drive, golf club fit sideways in trunk, safety, handling, fun, looks. No other AWD car has the balance of these and the price of the A4. My A4 I had been looking at the A4 for 2 years before I made my first purchase. It has been an overall positive experience and I highly recommend the vehicle to any consumer. Great for Wisconsin weather This car is great for driving in snow and very snappy weaving through busy traffic.  I can\\'t wait to try the S4. Better than BMW I have a 2006 BMW 530i with manual and sports suspension.  Lots of zip.  My wife has an A4 with 2.0 turbo and automatic.  Truth be told, I take her car on the weekend whenever I can.  Handling is about as good as the BMW and I find the BMW more fun to drive.  I prefer the interior and exterior styling more and the AWD is better in bad weather.  Interior is a tad smaller but for the two of us the car is purrfect.  My next car will be an Audi - probably with a 6 cylinder. Overall, the Audi is more. Powerful Compact Sedan First Audi, have to say it\\'s been great thus far. Test drove both 3.2 and 2.0T, felt 2.0T had more of a kick at start off.  Great fuel economy, and excellent overall build.  MMI lacks ability to play MP3s, and does not have external audio plug for iPod/accessories.  Rear seat lacks room, but this is a compact sedan.  6MT is decent, clutch has too much distance, lacks the short sport like feeling. Best car ever owned I previously owned an audi but this one takes the cake.  I downgraded to a 2003 GTI 20th AE and owned that for 6 months, then realized I really didn\\'t want FWD.  I went from AWD to FWD and now back to AWD and I will never go back to anything less.  The fact that my car is a lot faster than before and rides better than the VW and not to mention looks 100x better.  The A4 is a great car for anyone looking for a luxury and sporty vehicle.  I am still smiling everytime I drive my car, and you will too. Audi has Finally Impressed Me After test driving much of the competition, I test drove the Audi A4 Quattro and never looked back. The handling, interior luxury, and overall experience is unmatched by any of the others. While it may not have the name brand appeal of BMW/Mercedes, It is twice the car none-the-less. Audi = Attention to Detail!!!  Audi just needs to Market more. Never even seen a commercial. Mixed Review This is the second Audi purchased by my family.  The first, an Audi A6 had major brake problems at 20k.  We recently purchased a 2006 A4 with a S- Line package.  It does have a nice look and ride but we have had major problems with it since the purchase.  It has been in and out of the shop for several months with constant rattles, speakers not working, and a major problem with the front end.  The car will randomly lock up when turning corners and there is a constant rattle from the the wheel being turned.  This is a major dissapointment, because the vehicle is fun to drive and does perform well in poor driving conditions. A4 2.0T Excellent handling in rain conditions, comfort level is very high, it\\'s a very powerful car. Fast and Smooth First, the gearbox in this car is amazing... flawless shifting!  This car is all about the driver, giving an excellent drive that is fun, fast and smooth.  The quattro allows for quick, stable handling, especially at high speeds, that is superior to anything else I have owned.   One of the best cars I have ever owned!! In my opinion this is one of the nicest sedans made.  This car is just awesome in every way!   Open Roads of BC I drove my 3.2 V6 Quattro Audi through the open and windy highways of the rocky mountains of BC, Canada.  What an experience! We felt secure and comfortable even with 4 adults and a full trunk.  Engine just kept giving more and more power through the steep mountain passes while the Quattro kept us secure through the tight zigzag roads.  At times, I lose track of my excessive speeds! Word to the wise, it is best to choose the 3.2 engine if you want the heavier Quattro models.  This is the most well rounded car in its class.  Large trunk, more rear seating space than BMW 3-series or Lexus IS 350, excellent price, superior engine, and excellent fit & finish.  A4 Review I love the performance of this vehicle.  The pickup reminds me of the small block muscle cars of the 60s.The interior is very ergonomically friendly with all the buttons easy to reach.  The exterior has a stance that makes me feel like a lion among lambs on the road with an engine to back up my feelings when needed.  I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t get an Audi before, but with today\\'s advanced design, I\\'m glad I waited. Good Car, but.... Overall, a very nice car.  Powerful, solid frame, handles well.  We have the technology package with bluetooth and memory seats, etc. We have enjoyed the car except for one feature: the adaptive headlights.  These are Xenon headlights that move as the front wheels move.  A neat idea, but we\\'ve had continuing problems with one headlight cutting off when it gets sufficiently dark for the \"auto on\" feature to work.  Unfortunately, and despite a good effort, they have been unable to correct the problem and we are getting our money back through the state\\'s Lemon Law.  I would recommend the Audi A4, but not this adaptive light feature.  Better than my Lexus!!! I just love this car!!  The quality is outstanding.  I use the audi and my husband now has the Lexus R300.  I got the better car if you ask me.  The bose sound system is pure quality. The only complaint I would have, make the seats a little wider. Other than that this car is awesome and fun to drive... very fast. Fun To Drive I have owned this car for 4 weeks, and put over 2000 miles on it. 1600 of those on a road trip up the California coast. We had a blast driving this car, and got lots of comments and looks from admirers. Its a sport car, handles very well, and is very fast. The steering is unbelievable. You can make a u turn almost anywhere. Another neat thing about Audi is you can modify your car as much as you want. There are many companies that specialize in custom upgrades. You at least need to test drive this car if you are considering it. It\\'s a great car. Awesome! My 2006 A4 exceeded my expectation. Great pick-up, terrific handling, oustanding standard Audi symphony sound system.  This is my third A4 and the very best experience of all! Great car, Fun to drive! I got the S-Line package, and it really accentuates the handling of the car. It looks great on the outside, and the big wheels and sport suspension really makes the car handle well without riding rough. The interior is good looking and well laid out, and everything is made of nice materials. I also got the Bose package and it sounds pretty nice. Car is still breaking in, and mileage is getting better every day. Car is very quiet and refined on the highway, and is a lot of fun on a twisty road. I\\'m 6\\'3\", and there\\'s plenty of room for me, and theres still room for people in the back. Great overall, Minor Defects My audi is fun to drive,  quick. I got the titanium pkg and it looks great. The features are awsome, Bluetooth, adaptive HIDs , etc etc. The AWD is great. Driving in harsh rain is a breeze. Automatic dimming mirrors and wipers is a lovely feature. The seats are so comfortable and the leather is of high quality.  Best car I\\'ve owned This car handles like no other car I\\'ve ever owned. I live in Alaska and I\\'ve driven it 400 miles in a blizzard with no traction problems whatsoever. For that reason alone, this Audi is worth every dollar I paid for it. It will go fast and then it will stop on a dime, even on glare ice. Amazing! The only problem I\\'ve had is that the engine coil was defective and had to be replaced during the first month (um, minor detail). I have read a lot of comments about the parking brake, cupholder, and armrest configuration. For me this has been only a minor inconvenience but it would be nicer not to have to move the armrest. All that notwithstanding, I love this car. It is so much fun to drive!  2006 A4 Awesome ride!  Car drives beautifully.  Awesome control in bad weather which gets better in good weather. Excellent interior quality.  Turbo really makes the car jump. Low-end torque is very good. Love our A4 I got an A4 2.0T with a premium package in Red for my wife in March 06 as a replacement for her 93 Ford Escort which she loved and hated to give up.  However, after a week in the A4 she stopped talking about her Ford.  Her only problem with the car is getting me out of it so she can drive it. The dealer was excellent and I\\x92m bringing it in for the first 5,000 service.  This was our first Audi, but will not be our last. Awesome Car I initially was in the market for a camry or TSX, but went to the Audi dealer on a whim.  I love the way the car handles and the steering feel.  It truly is a speed sensitive steering, unlike the BMW3, and easy to manuever. Great car for people of all ages.  The car is a great blend of luxury and sportiness.  Cannot express how much I love the steering wheel and steering ease in the parking lot.  I drive a lot in stop and go traffic and the car handles flawlessly.  I live in the harsh midwestern climate, and the quatrro definitely is fully utilized.   Love my car,  Attention Audi board/exec members, if you are reading this, please do not change the steering ease/speed senstive wheel.  Great Car I have always wanted an Audi and now I finally have one. And, so far it has not been a disappointment. For the last 12 years, I have driven only Acura Integras and RSXs. So, it was time for a change. Of course, it has only been a month but everything about the car says \"cool car\". And while I really do not care what others think, it is nice to hear people say lots of nice things about it. Excellent audi A4 This is a great driving car for a 2.0 litre turbo vehicle. I have an all road as well and both drive differently. The A4 S line drives like a sports car. After 2500 miles the car seems to get faster and more agile with every turn. I do get a lot of looks from audi owners because of the S line which makes it look like an S4. A4 2.0T 6SpMan - Best in class Had a 2001 A4 1.8T Quattro; recently upgrade to \\'06 A4 2.0T Quattro S-line with manual 6spd tranny. Awesome car, fantastic handling and ride control. Try driving with the ESP off - it puts the cars outer limits back in your control. So far so good Maybe it\\'s too soon to offer this, but I\\'ll do it anyway.  Picked up the A4 2.0T this week.  It\\'s an amazingly comfortable car.  The ride is very smooth, and the engine noise is almost pleasant.  I\\'ve taken it pretty easy so far, but the one time I went for a little speed the car responded nicely.  I got the nav system and the display is really nifty, but it\\'s also a little distracting.   Great car for my daughter I bought this car for my daughter to drive in college at University Of Colorado.  We live in Southern California and so my daughter is not an experienced driver on snow and ice.  Since I grew up in the Midwest, I know the importance of traction.  Since I pay for the gas, I also know the importance of mileage.  With 8 air bags, all wheel drive, Audi reliability, and a 100,000 bumper to bumper warranty, all coupled with 22 mpg City and 30 mpg country this car was our top pick.  I lost a nephew in an accident so safety is also important to me.  I own 8 vehicles of 2000 or newer including an S500 Mercedes.  The A4 Audi is the \"best bang for the buck\" of all of them.  I love the car! Awesome Audi I have had my 06 A4 3.2 Quattro for a month and have a little over 1300 miles.  The car is absolutely a blast to drive.  Quiet, powerful, and smooth. Handling is predictable and confidence inspiring. The overall workmanship is top notch.  The exterior styling is both classy and sporty.  The interior is typically Audi - the best in the industry.  The car exudes quality and solidity.  It is worth every penny. solid car this is a really good car.  the ride is unbelievably smooth and quiet, even over bumps. the sport suspension of the s-line package is great.  the transmission is smooth during acceleration and engine noise is non- obtrusive.  for the first few thousand miles the car seemed a bit jumpy at initial acceleration, but that has evened out... most likely a result of the car breaking in and getting used to driving it.  the ride is responsive and fun, plus there are tons of cool features to be had. Wow!!! Best car I drove & get the 6speed I test drove a mustang, 350z, impreza, g35 coupe, etc and bought this amazing A4.  I found myself doing 80mph in 3rd gear on the street and shocked on how it jumped (in acceleration). Wow!!!  As a gear head at heart I worked on many muscle cars (and subsequently drove them) but again WOW!  Of all the options the A4 offers you have to get the S-line package. It\\'s a total aggressive look, 18 inch tires, and sports suspension. Just one drive and you know where that extra dollars were well spent.  When buying a car I look at beauty, comfort, speed and most a fun factor. Something I missed with my last vehicle. I have 4 fun factors again now in my drive & its fantastic  Here we go again I had a 2003 TT.  Great car to drive, but reliability was terrible.  With only 6700 miles everything went wrong.  Well I deceided to try Audi again. Only one week old and the memory seats don\\'t work. Hello Audi. They make a great driving car and thats it. Reliability is horrible.  The current clutch is also a disaster.  It has no definite grip point Look forward to driving to work This is my first Audi.  Having spent a while looking around at other cars, I was sold on the Audi by its new looks alone.  Once inside, on the road, and around the curves I knew it was the car for me.  BMW lost me on their new 3 series re-design. Great sound system, convenient display of XM Radio data, toasty heated seats, & great dash design.  The 2.0T is an engineering powerhouse when considering its fuel efficiency. Sweet machine!!! This car is an absolute joy to drive. I wanted a manual trans, but fell in love with the CVT on a test drive. With SoCal traffic I\\'m glad I chose the CVT. Paddle shifting is a great feature. The build quality is first rate and so far (5300 miles) not one problem. Lots of positive comments on the appearance. Handling is wonderful and the power is surprising, especially from a four cylinder. I would highly recommend this car if a compact sedan suits your needs.  Excellent AWD car I\\'ve owned this car for just a few weeks and the handling is superb. The interior material are of top notch quality and the seats are very comfortable, though it\\'s a little tight for adult back seat passengers for a long ride. For a four cylinder this car has plenty of pep, most six cylinders couldn\\'t come close. The standard stereo has very decent sound, but I wish I opted for the premium Bose with satellite radio. That was my error. Adding the proper satellite tuner now to the satellite ready stereo is about $400.00. A few reservations The A4, while fun to drive, leaves some reservations.  There is a noticeable hesitation when starting from zero.  Consumer Reports mentions this.  The 4-cyl. turbo, while powerful with a nice, occasionally pleasant burble, is, at times coarse.  Also noticed by CR.  The sound quality of the audio system is just good, not up to the sound in our \\'99 A6.  But the comfort and convenience, the surprising torque, the sheer joy of taking turns faster than you really should while the A4 clings firmly to the asphalt is thrilling.   Wish it had DSG I used to drive a Passat V6 sedan FWD with auto transmission, and this Audi A4 is significantly better in all respects, but it should be - considering the 6 years and $10,000 list price difference. Haven\\'t had any quality problems with the car, it feels very solid and dependable. The manual gearbox is a bit of a \\'clunker\\', not exactly the quick light box I remember from a 3-series BMW. After 4000 miles it doesn\\'t show much sign of easing up, and gear changes can be a bit rough. Also the steering is a bit heavy compared with a 3-series, but that could I guess be due to the Quattro 4WD? Overall, a very impressive car with a great engine. Goes well and sips fuel. A4 1.8T Quatro One of the most expensive car to maintain. It will eat your wallet. If you know how to work on this car go for it. It drives very solid and safe. AWD great on snow but when you have more than 6-7 inches of snow you are in trouble. Very low clearance. Almost every Audi made around that time have problem with cluster panel. Air bag light on. has bunch of very expensive sensors. If all the maintenance done regularly it is OK to buy one of them. Otherwise even if you get it for free prepare yourself for $3 to 4  thousands of repairs in couple years. Engine mount and tranmsn mnt collapsed at 110K mls. That shakes rear axle like hell. Front end have so many parts to replace. FORGET ABOUT IT!!!!!!! 1999 1.8T Avant - 208,000 Miles Built in October 1998 and purchased in April 1999. This car came with the sport steering wheel and beautiful cloth seats. I added mud guards to help protect the exterior. The interior materials are very good. I\\'ve had no issues with the engine. It\\'s unstoppable. It has the original clutch, still going after millions of shits.There\\'s no body rust. The bad: The 99 Avants did have some front suspension issues. They were mostly covered under warranty. The rear wheel bearings need to be changed pretty frequently. The side airbags had problems too, but they\\'re easy to replace.  1999 Audi A4 2.8 AWD The 1999 audi has really been one of the best cars i have ever owned and i have owned a lot in the past. The reliability of it has been very good i got it with 116,000 on it and it now has 153,000 with only one little problem in the middle of the mileage. It was a valve cover gasket, just leaking a little bit of oil, not a big deal replaced it myself in just under a hour. otherwise haven\\'t had any other problems. the 1999 audi is a great car for someone who cares about cars and knows how to maintain a car. A Leason Learned I bought the car used with 70,000 miles and have somehow managed to put 35,000 on it in a year and change (still trying to figure out how I did that). Even though I bought it with the expectation of putting some money into it, I had no idea that I\\'d put in almost $5000 for a number of various problems. Valve cover gaskets were replaced, new tires, front axles, new control unit, and assorted other things. Unless you have the tools and the know-how to do a lot of the work yourself, I\\'d recommend looking elsewhere.  Not for Poseurs Our Audi A4 Quattro WAGON 2.8 V6 5spd was very hard to find!   It has front AND side impact airbags.  It\\x92s not a turbo (no sludge problems!)  It was before dual exhaust, so it has a SINGLE muffler!  It\\x92s the later 1999 production with the newer (better) style dash and elipsoloid headlights.  Mine is the simplest/best A4 to own.  With a good mechanic who doesn\\x92t rip you off, you\\x92ll have the suspension fully sorted and many trouble-free miles.  The build quality on these cars is incredible \\x96 we\\x92ve hit 130K with no drama and never roadside breakdown.  Am now parting with it (Vermont \\x96 thanks \\x96 ask Craig to see the listing) only saying goodbye to \\x93Shanta\\x94 because we\\x92re moving overseas. 1999 Audi A4 2.8 The 1999 audi a4 2.8 wagon is on of the best cars i have ever owned it has 147,000 on it without a single problem. The Quattro goes throw just about anything and that 2.8 has a lot of power at higher rpm but down low is not bad. I do all my own servicing i run amsoil in it and it seems to like that the best. Mileage is just ok could be better.  Never by an Audi again This car was reliable for the first 5 years but since then it has been nothing but a money pit. It has broken down at the side of the road several times and every time it\\'s at least a $700 dollar visit to the garage. The interior quality is bad. Cup holder broke, hatchback interior paneling broke. The engine is underpowered. Like many AWD cars, it goes through tires quickly. It is just not a well built car. Fun to drive Our Avant is a great car. It\\'s fun to drive and the styling is great. We have had our share of mechanical issues but it still beats driving the less than inspiring others. Quick, Great Handling, and Reliable (currently 48000 miles) The car accelerates fast and when the turbo kicks in it takes off, especially above 3500 RPM. I like the gearing (5- spd manual) as first gear is long enough that I usually don\\'t have to shift mid-corner when turning after a stop sign/light. The interrior is comfortable (leather) with many adjustments for seat location and the audio system is well done. The airbag warning light has illuminated twice since I bought it for seemingly no reason, after taking it to a dealer they said nothing was wrong and turned it off, so not a big problem. The car runs great every time I start it and is very reliable. I highly recommend a GIAC ecu flash to improve performance. Beware of the Audi Certified Used Car I purchsed the Audi Avant as a \\rreplacement for my VW New Beetle.  At \\rthe time, I felt comfortable \\rpurchasing a pre-owned car because the \\rdealership had reconditioned it, and \\rit was covered under the Audi Assured \\rWarranty.  After about 6 months, the \\rCertification was worth the paper it \\rwas written on.  The car has had \\rnumberous problems, not to mention it \\rwas sold to me with body damage.  Audi \\rneeds to do better, I wouldn\\'t \\rrecommend the Audi Assured program to \\ranyone. 5 Years and Going Strong I bought this car new 5 years ago and I  OH YEAH! THIS CAR OWNS!! This was the best affordable car I\\'ve  ! Excellent car, but may feel a bit \\rsmall, especially in the back seat. For \\rdriving and a sense of security and \\rcontrol - none better. Couldn\\'t beat it \\ron snow and ice (I came out of a SAAB, \\rthought that one was good before \\rgetting into the AUDI. Dealership very \\rgood incl service Very Nice Car! I recently bought a 99 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro and I seriously am happy with this buy. It\\'s the fastest, most comfortable car I have ever been in. It\\'s very reliable so far and I hope it stays that way for awhile. The features in it are outstanding for a 99 car and I just love it. I do not regret buying it one bit. The best part is that it\\'s my first car and I completely own it! Rev it up! Fun to drive.Handles great with AWD and goes right up snowy hills in Worcester.Overall solid feel to the car.Doesn\\'t look like a 15 year old car at all and I don\\'t do anything special to take care of it.Expensive repairs come with the deal - expect them.Wheel bearings (make sure your wheels are balanced and car aligned), flex pipes, dirt in ABS sensor lights the dash. Dash is currently lit up like a Christmas tree.I\\'ll miss it but I\\'m scrapping it with too many repairs needed for an \\'06 Ford Escape Hybrid AWD (I MUST have AWD) Quater Million Miles and still going strong! I got a great deal on the car in 2006 and planned on driving it for a year and then selling it to make some profit. I was blown away after the first winter driving this car in Northeast Ohio. After 245k the paint still looks new there\\'s no rust the engine runs great the transmission shifts perfectly.. my only complaint is that I have been through 6 wheel bearings and 8 control arms.. I was told by my mechanic get used to the oil leak that is just the Audi way of marking its territory..there is nothing on this car that is cheap to repair.even though I paid cash for my car I still consider the repairs to be a monthly car payment. But still my favorite car keeps going and going.. Bought this car from the original owner in May of \\'09 with 129k on the meter. Three years later at 160k we still enjoy this car. As with any of the other Euro cars we\\'ve owned (two BMW\\'s, Volvo S60) there are a few maintenance items that many people grumble about, but this car still runs as if it were new. Yes, the parts and repairs are expensive, but the end result is pride of ownership and reliability which you don\\'t get from, as an example-a 13-year old Taurus with 160k on it! MISTAKE This is a terrible car. Do not do it. I sold my Lincoln hoping the AWD would help me out in the winter and I sold the car within 2 months of having it. My clutch was bad, the back axles were screechy (500 fix), wiring for blinker was bad (200 fix), the CD player didn\\'t work right, the tape player ate tapes, the cigerrete lighter wouldn\\'t open(I couldn\\'t charge my phone or gps) one of the rear windows wouldn\\'t roll up or down, the display screen was broken, the bumper began to fall off after 2 weeks, the buttons were coming off on the key fob.. AWFUL 207,000 and still runs strong!!! Great car and a blast to drive. There easy to fix if you know anything about cars. Buy aftermarket parts online and it is cheap to keep on the road. Still org. motor and trans. Just keep her tuned up and it will treat you well. I dont care what make you have it will need work at some point like wheel bearings and ball joints and tie rods. The only thing that gets me is the oil leaking it is with all 2.8 engines. Have the new gaskets put in when the timming service is done and it will save you a pile of money. I have a 98 and my wife drives a 99 with 160,000 miles. Still love the car Bought my Audi 2.8 AWD car with 70k on it  about 5 years ago.  I have had the usual issues that \"all\" Audi consumers experience.  Control Arms, brakes Axel wheel bearings and tie rods.  Skid plate clips broke away so I removed it in the spring, and by the summer the AC compressor had failed because of water and other road elements.  I am also convinced that older Audi\\'s dump engine exhaust heat into the cabin which annoying in the summer.  With all that, you would think that I strongly disapprove of the car but on the contrary, I love the performance, AWD, winter and summer driving is always fun and plan to purchase my 7th one this winter.  before you buy ask about timing belt, suspension..  Solid little car So after my Saab 9000 died, I got my little Audi, and I have been loving itt since. I\\'ve put a couple of thousand miles on it, and I love it. Quattro has actually saved my life, and the car is definitely one of the most solid feeling cars that I\\'ve ever been in. I love how this car has attracted a cult of modders, if I ever need anything, I just go on the forums and do the diy, the 1.8t is vital, and the automatic just kills the whole experience because turbo+manual+quattro= some slightly illegal amazingness. Quattro! This car handles like no other car I have driven in my life. The Audi grips and grips, and that more than makes up for the lack of power from the 1.8t. I have more confidence in the handling and the solidity of the Audi. The only thing that I\\'ve had to replace is a window regulator on my car. It cost 250, but that was reasonable.  First Time Audi Buyer I liked the car because of the brand (big fan) and how it looks good and the ability of the Quattro system. Bought a 10 year old car for about $10K. I\\'ve owned it for 16 mos. I disliked it because I\\'ve spent over $5,500 in repairs. It didn\\'t have problem at first month but afterward, timing belt $1.5K, bearings changed all of them @ $700, twice in LR wheel within 1 year, CV shafts $500, flex pipe $400, spark plugs+wire set twice bc engine stutters 200 etc. The worst is my car was put in all the money, there\\'s more to fix ABS Module $400, engine oil leak and clutch $2.5K, brake pad worn signal, rear axle leak etc. and then some guy totaled my car on the hwy. ALL $$$ I put in, gone. Just keep up with maintenance. easy I bought this car about a year ago, since then I\\'ve only needed to replace the timing belt. no mayor problems the only things that have been replaced are parts that any other car replacement is needed. i do most of the work myself. the Quattro system is awesome all year round also the turbo is strong (just check you oil on every gas fill up) this German car is built to last. at 160 HP i keep up with cars that have 20 HP or 30 Hp more then me, i do not recommend the A4 to people who don\\'t know about cars. I don\\'t think i want to sell it. Buyer Beware I purchased this car in July \\'09 and loved the way it drove. However, after owning it for 8 months it needed $1250.00 for a valve seal problem and at the same time  my mechanic recommended to change the timing belt as well, which is another $1300. Then I had a heavy vibration through my steering wheel which I decided was the last straw. Instead of fixing everything, I traded it in on a \\'97 Lexus ES 300 which I should have bought to begin with. This Lexus is amazing and so smooth as well. Be understanding that if you do purchase this Audi car that you have to be prepared for heavy labor costs on fixing it. Everything is $500+ and some servicing will ding you $1000 plus.  Beware of Engine Oil Sludge problems  Bought this car new from the dealer in 1999 and did regular oil changes with the dealership.   Just last month .. oil pressure light goes on and discovered that the engine developed a major Sludge problem ....  cost $5,000 to fix ...beware! If the dealship knew about this problem they should have suggested to change to synthetic oil and do more regular oil changes ... Terribly disappointed with Audi !!! Good Car Overall I bought the car with 155000, call me crazy but I did. Knock on wood nothing major has happened. Although, I wanted to change my transmission fluid and it\\x92s a huge deal because Audi has once again made it difficult. Seeing past this, it has been fun to drive and everything still works except the triptronic sensor is bad but still shifts fine in \"d\". This car rewards good driving, if you take it easy, the car will outlast you. Run, Don\\'t Walk RUN, don\\'t walk away from this car.  154,000 miles over 10 years have not been easy.  Started needing heavy repairs right after the extended warranty ran out, at 60K.  Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, to the tune of $15,000 in repairs over the life of the car.  Even the seats wore out.  Audi software does not work on the computers many foreign car repair places have.  Many places can\\'t even do oil changes.  All repairs are expensive and then something else crops up.  Audi\\'s are NOT for anyone who needs a reliable car and doesn\\'t know much about how they run. Won\\'t change it for the world I bought her at 95000 miles and so far in almost 3 years I\\'ve put about 30000 miles on it. Just changed the timing belt a few months ago. This is a good thing to do when you go over 100000 miles. Of course I\\'ve had some problems with the abs module, and control arms that seem to be the common issues with this car. Most of the repairs to the suspension, brakes or rotors can be done by the home mechanic since the car is so well thought and with a set of wrenches you can do a lot. Also look for aftermarket parts since the ones from the dealer have some outrageous prices. Like somebody said \"You have to pay to play.\" Amazing and Costly The 1999 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro sedan is a great great car. I\\'ve never owned a car that is so much fun to drive. It is everything anyone would want. It\\'s comfortable, fast, sporty, luxury, and capable. It\\'s an all around great car and I will always own an Audi. The two draw backs are poor fuel economy and premium fuel only. This is a huge expense and maintenance is really expensive. It is well worth the price. The car is now 8 year old with 110,000 miles and shows no rust, no signs of getting old, and runs like a champ. I tell my friends its a 99 and they say it looks brand new. Great car. A++ Take care of it & it\\'ll take care of you Bought my 1999 A4 2.8 manual shift used with 28,000 miles on it and have loved it every step of the way to its current 110,000 miles and counting.  Ride has remained firm and car is solid and tight.  I highly recomend the larger engine to the smaller engine with turbo, otherwise you\\'re just going to be too underpowered and frustrated.  It is important to remember though, that this is a german car not japanese and does require a certain degree of regular maintenance, which I\\'ve found to be $800 a year on average, all in, to keep things in top condition.  I\\'d definitely buy another Audi! Great car, maintenance expensive I have never had any part fail on me in 90k miles.  It has however been expensive to keep just the regular dealer-recommended maintenance schedule.  It seems like no matter what I get replaced, it\\'s $1000.  But car still runs great, starts every time without problem in Boston winters and still gets compliments 8 years later. Sticks to road, but roBs your wallet I bought the car used with about 90K miles.  Worked fine until 110K.  I have since spent over $3000.  I\\'ve never spent so much on a car and I always buy cars around 100K. However, I\\'ve stuck to Japanese cars before.  I\\'ve learned my lesson.  I\\'m looking to trade it in for a Subaru.  What every one else\\'s review says is true.  Fun to drive, expensive to maintain. Good basic transportation For the northland the A4T quattro is an excellent choice.  However, I have experienced the electronic glitches that my dealership says are unique to this model year.  I gave up my BMW E30 with 300k for the quattro and will likely go back in the near future for the fun and driving experience.  All in all good transportation, but I would for sure seek out the sport pkg if another A4 hits my radar. Good car - When working properly. Bought this car with 43,500 miles. So far in 3500 miles here is what has been done to the car: Coil Pack replaced-$451.00 Sunroof switch - $60.00  Gauge cluster went out - $561.00  Airbag light continues to come on - $150.00 (Dealership has not solved the problem yet-light just came on again!!) Now the water pump is making a bearing noise! Cost: $502.00.  I am a VW/Audi enthusiast and am severely disappointed with this car. To think I sold a perfectly good 96 Passat TDI for this? The car did sit outside for a while before I purchased it-but still... Fuel mileage has been 21 city,  28 hwy. SO SO. Driving Fun I bought this car new, & have enjoyed very much.  I would replace it w/another A4, but I now live in an area w/o a local Audi dealer.  It makes driving fun.  Exceptional control in snow. Parts are expensive. It\\'s not as reliable as a Honda (had one once), but so much better to drive.  Great audio, comfortable seats; a driving experience. Stuck in Audi hell I bought it used at 30K miles. It was fun to drive for   about 15K, 20K miles, then the timing belt snapped (long before the recommended replacement mileage).  FYI, cylinder heads from the Fatherland are EXPENSIVE. Better replace the belt every 30K miles just to be safe. Since then, nothing but problems: ABS brake sensors (twice), tie rod ends (many), wheel speed sensors, an unknown compression problem that stumped three mechanics, including the dealer, power window motor, a half-moon seal(?), and more. Now the transmission is acting up.  Stunning First I want to get one thing out of the way, It\\'s an Audi, some repairs are going to be expensive. If you want cheap, this is not the car for your. On a better note, This car is absolutely amazing to drive, I have the Sport and Cold weather packages as well and let me tell you, make sure yours has the sport package. This vehicle grips the road like a magnet! Winter driving with the Quattro system will not leave one disappointed, Truly is the ultimate snowmobile. Also do not be fooled by the performance specs... while not a sports car, the 1.8T engine has plenty of get up and go to make even a grown man giggle like a little kid. Audi A4 1.8T does the job The Audi A4 has been so much fun to drive even though I have only had it for a couple of months. The only thing that is wrong with it is that when it is idling it tends to vibrate a little too much for me. Also the fan for the AC sounds like a vaccum cleaner. Other than those two things, to me, it is a great car! Worst Purchase Ever! BEWARE! I wish I could go back to the day I bought this A4 and run. It has been nothing but trouble since day one. Problem 1) Ruined front suspension = $1600. Problem 2) Defective turbo valve = $450 Problem 3) Defective catelytic converter = $1100 Problem 4) Defective wheel bearings = $Leaving Them...... And so on and so forth. Basically, this car is an overpriced and less reliable Ford Pinto. I should have bought an Escort - this thing was the biggest mistake I\\'ve ever made. I will buy a BMW next time.  Consider yourself warned.  I love it - When not in the shop! This is great car if you have another car.  It is great fun to drive, on the few ocassions that it is not broken.  Seriously - this car has had one problem after another and spent a couple of months total (really) in the shop in the 22 months I had it.  Repairs and parts cost a fortune and only a handful of mechanics know how to work on it.  I have traded it in on a new car. Audi A4=less cash in your pocket Not to beat a dead horse, this is the *absolute worse car ever*... radiator-replaced at 20k miles (warranty) ABS (twice out of pocket) brakes (out of pocket) power window (still doesn\\'t work) suspension (major work at 40k) vacuum hoses (bad at 40k) recall after recall etc., etc., etc.,  This car is a nightmare for maintenance. The car stumped several mechanics several times. They just didn\\'t know how to fix it (and these guys were very smart). They just kept throwing parts at it until the engine light or whatever went off...the nightmare is over. I just sold this stupid thing and bought lexus. I\\'ll never ever go back to audi. ever.  What a racket, make a car that fails every month and then rip off the consumer with high price parts (who ever heard of $1100 for a catalytic convertor? - x2=$2200 for exhaust components alone!!). Money pit This is a rich man\\'s car.  I have spent more money in repairs and maintenance than on the car itself.  ($2,300 in costs to pass emissions test.)  I am at the garage every other month with a new problem.  Do yourself and your wallet a favor and avoid this car. Get an Audi 1.8T quattro sport! Very fun to drive! I got an average of 33 mpg when on a long freeway drive! Great car for the money! Solid, safe and a blast! This car has been better than my Honda ever was and a hell of a lot more fun. Yes a wheel bearing went south at 77k but this is no big deal to me. Almost all cars need timing belts replaced and so am not taking points away because of this. My Accord felt like a tin can flexing its way down the street. I now press into turns rather than slow down as other require.  Don\\'t get burned!!! I recently sold my 1999 A4 AWD 2.8 65K miles. I owned it for exactly 1 year. After 1 year, the transmission needed to be replaced. The estimate was $5000- $7000. I said fix it good enough to drive across town to the Nissan dealer. In addition, it was due for its 60K mile service >$650. The service person made an excellent point in saying, \"If you can\\'t afford the routine maintenence, then you can\\'t afford the vehicle.  I got caught up in being a pretentious fool. You shouldn\\'t. Buy something else!   Bad Mechanical Fun to drive, if it\\'s not in the shop!  Have had new engine, too.  Lots of mechanical problems. Dump this car before warranty ends Good car for highway driving, way too slow off the line for a \\'driver\\'s\\' car, lots of engine leaks and burned out headlights, poor tires for winter driving as they were incompatible with ABS. Ran ok for about 65,000 miles except for power and gas consumption issues. I thought I could keep it maintained and have a good car but repairs were averaging $600/month for last 10 months. Mainly electronics problems -   Dealer did poor job of diagnosing problems - his solution was to keep adding new parts until warning lights went out.  Dealer told me that I would soon need new boots for steering and transmission components and new brakes. - Ouch!!  Car is sold!! No more Audi\\'s ever. Don\\'t Do It - As Much As You May Want To I love how this car drives.  And the body style still holds up even though it is six years old.  The handling, power and quality of the interior design are all pluses.  But the lack of mechanical reliability is a huge negative.  I\\'ve spent over $6,000 in repairs since purchasing this car just over 3 years ago.  Repairs include - new oxygen sensors, water pump/timeing belt, ABS control module, brake rotors, etc.  I\\'ve had it - and will be selling this car soon. Not as bad as some say! I purchased my Audi A4 with 55,000 miles and it now has 74,000 miles. I\\'ve replaced brake pads, water pump, timing belt w/tensioner, t. pulley, idler pulley, drive belt, front diff. axle seal, wires and plugs, and oil. Although this would have cost alot at a dealer, I purchased the parts online and replaced them myself. If your a decent mechanic or have alot of $$$, I\\'d highly recomend this vehicle. The 2.8 is a little under powered w/Tiptronic trans., but nothing beats the Quattro in the Michigan winter! I love it, but it frightens me... I bought this \\'99 from Audi with 34k miles, now has 55k. All service needed has been under warranty: Both rear bearings, new radiator, brake rotors, replaced from bushing. For the first year it was in the shop once a quarter, it seemed. So far this year - no problems. I love to drive it, looks great, handles great. But once the warranty ends this year - what will happen? Will it turn on me or be \"one of the good ones\"? Dealer has been good, and so far I am OK with the experience - thanks to the warranty! Awesome Car This is a great car.  It is so beautiful inside!  Rich, contrasting colors are great.  Ride is amazing.  Bose stereo sounds impressive and full.  I will sell my car and I will cry when I sell it.  This is from a guy.  Get a tiptronic, it is the way to go. I Love This Car! I bought my Audi used with 31,000 miles (now she\\'s at 53,000) and I have had no problems, just had to get a new battery and tires!  Very reliable and I will definitely check out Audi\\'s when I am looking for my next car.   High Cost of Ownership From day one my 1999 Audi A4 has had problems.  I bought it used with low miles and the certificed / extended warranty.  It has had tons of electrical problems. I\\'m not sure what they did with when declared it a certified vehicle. the sensors and leaks continually need to be fixed.  I think it says it all when the dealer has a special service price to check the airbag light - $200 before repairs and then another $800 for the acutal airbag that is only five years old.  Even normal maintenance is just a rip-off, such as $1,000 for a new timing belt and water pump.  The water pump started leaking after the twelve month parts warranty.  Be strongly cautioned against \"Audi workmanship.\" Fine until warranty expires The 1999 Audi A4 2.8 quattro Sedan is a fun car to drive, most notably due to its incredible power and handling. Its front seats are very compfortable, and its controls are logically positioned and easy to access.  The rear seats are a bit cramped, but OK for occasional use.  It has lots of trunk space. Audi\\'s 50,000 mile warranty (even covers oil changes) is excellent assuming you drive enough miles per year to make use of the full warranty. Despite the fact that the car was carefully driven and exceptionally well maintained, problems began after the warranty expired. Major problems included fuel injectors (55,000 miles, $600), lower control arms (70,000 miles, $800), and both rear wheel bearings (80,000 miles, $650). Get out your wallet, this car is junk You would have to be INSANE to buy an Audi A4.\\rI drive mine 12,000 miles per year TOPS and have\\rdone $3,000 worth of repairs with less than 60,000 \\rmiles on it.  I\\'ve had bad wheel bearings, \\rtiming belt (which will destroy the \\rengine if it ever breaks), water pump, \\rradiator hoses, mass airflow sensor, \\rand now the thermostat.  The dealer \\rcharges $400 to replace the \\rTHERMOSTAT!!!  (a $30 part).\\r Even in peak operating condition, this \\rcar would get killed by a Honda Civic \\rin a drag race, and gets lousy gas \\rmileage.  Do not be fooled by the Audi \\rbadge, these are Volkswagens in \\rdisguide, except the maintenance is twice \\ras expensive.  Get a Lexus. Great, But Expensive to Maintain I love driving this car.  But after \\rowning it for two and 1/2 years I\\'m \\rnow asking myself: is the fun is worth \\rthe high maintenance costs?  Routine \\rmaintenance is much more expensive \\rthan the two VW\\'s I drove before \\rthis.  Example - new front pads and \\rbrake fluid - $350 versus about ~$200 \\ron my \\'95 Jetta.  Ouch.  Plus, my \\rwater pump went out at 60k which \\rrequired me to also replace the timing \\rbelt and serpentine belt at a $1,250 \\rprice tag.  That one still stings.  \\rAsk me in two more years the answer to \\rmy above question.  If no more major \\rmaintenance, then I will have loved \\rthis car - if there\\'s much more, then \\rI\\'d say the costs were not worth the \\rprice. Bring your checkbook When it\\'s running well, it\\'s a great\\rcar. Handles great, plenty of power, it\\rfeels both sporty and safe. It\\'s also\\rquiet and comfortable. But the car\\'s had\\rone electrical problem after another.\\rIt\\'s had 4(!) gas guage sensors, and\\rneeds another, among an assortment of\\rother problems that were either fixed\\runder warranty, or are not being fixed\\rbecause the cost of fixing them is\\rprohibitive. Every trip for maintenance\\ris a $1500-2000 excursion. I think I\\'ll\\rgo for a Toyota next time. Not as bad as it sounds Always wanted an A4, finally talked \\rmyself into getting a certified \\'99 \\rpreviously leased by a soccer mom. I \\rfigured with the warranty and it being \\rused as a family vehicle I was safe \\rbuying my first used car. So far, a few \\rproblems. The rear wheel rotor went \\rduring first month. Broken magnetic \\rstrip in the tiptronic housing. A \\rheadight died. A coolant leak and oil \\rleak needed attention. Paint chipping \\ron trunk lid. Radio has spazed out a \\rfew times, but no repairs needed. \\rBrakes are acting up at 70k miles. \\rCatalytic converter blew one day. Thank \\rGod for the warranty. Otherwise, the \\rcar has been great. Very comfortable to \\rdrive and ride in. I looooove it The car is beautiful, sporty, fun to \\rdrive, and gets compliments everywhere \\rI take it. That may be for aesthetic \\rreasons...and I understand some people \\rhave problems with Audis, however this \\ris a good year (as opposed to problem \\ryears 96-97) and I think I got a good \\rone. 140000 great miles 140,000 miles and we have had two \\rfailures, both casued by husnad in a \\rhurry. The plastic on the dipstick \\rhandle broke when twisted incorrectly \\ras did the plastic surround for the \\rparking brake. This car has just been \\rterrific to drive and it is outstanding \\rin rain (we live in Western WA, we know \\rrain) and snow. Engine has been \\rbulletproof, interior shows virtually \\rno wear on any surfaces. Our third \\rAudi, certainly not our last.  So much for so little I have had this car for about 4 months now and really \\rlove the car.  Not just the looks but performance.  I felt \\rthe 150hp wasn\\'t enough, and one mod(Chip $400) \\rmade me happy with 200hp and 243ft/tq.  You wont \\rbe dissapointed when buy this car the AWD helps out \\rnicely when driving in snow/rain or just everyday use.  \\rThe cost of repairs is a little steep, but it lacks there it \\rmakes up in exceptional gas milage (for an \\rAWD/Turboed car) of 23/32, and looks and \\rperfornace Will not give up my 2.8 I dod a tone of research prior to buying\\ran A4. After comparing to five other\\rpossibilities I took the plunge and have\\rbeen the happiest driver since. Found a\\r2.8 Sport PKG with 5-spd manual with\\r60K. I have since added a tune kit(air\\rinduction, exhaust, brakes, and ECU)\\rfrom Evolution Motor Sports in Tempe AZ\\rand have had even more fun!! Although it\\ris a little more money for the car in\\rterms of initial cost and maintaining,\\rit will cost the same as buying a\\rcheaper auto that you have to fix\\rcoonstantly like the GMC Jimmy I had\\rpreviously. Living in Colorado every\\raspect of the A4 is used and enjoyed.\\rCan\\'t wait to get a new one in about\\r200K miles!! A4 Quattro Great car -- just wish I didn\\'t go  A4 review Overall im very pleased with my vehicle \\rHowever ive had a few problems with it. \\rThe drivers side window has been giving \\rme issues. It appears to bind at times \\rnot wanting to go up also, the MFA \\rillumination doesnt work well all the \\rtime. I wasnt expecting a cream puff \\rsince I bought it used but, these are \\rissues I didnt expect these so soon. \\rThe car so far has been super reliable \\rwith great handling in any weather \\rcondition. I generally get about 27.5 \\rmpg hwy and 23 in the city. Overall \\rimvery happy with my purchase and would \\rbuy another A4.   driver\\'s car lots of fun to drive, quattro makes it \\rsuper on most any surface.  look for \\rnarrow dirt roads and have a blast.  \\rnew version looks good but I like \\rthe \"pinch\" on the top of the trunk on \\rmine better.\\r My second Audi After my lovely Jaguar XJS burnt up in \\ra freak occurence, I was left with my \\r1996 Audi.  Although I loved the \\rroadability, I was ready for all the \\rbells and whistles on my 1999.  It \\rreally compares favorably to the much \\rmore expensive Jag, although I did love \\rthat car.  The Audi is  completely \\rdependable and not expensive to keep on \\rthe road.  I am thinking about getting \\ra convertible.   Great car I have driven this 5 speed 2.8 Quatro  Fun car... but not with all the probs!!! These are great cars, but mine was in \\rthe shop more than my garage!  From \\r50k to 60k miles it needed over $8000 \\rin repairs, thank god for the extended \\rwarranty Falling Apart Loved the car when I bought it but  Don\\'t do it! Everything was fine for three years.  \\rThe honeymoon is over.  After \\rmaintaining the car to the letter and \\rtaking it to the dealer for regularly \\rscheduled maintenance, the engine light \\rcame on.  As a fluke I took it to a \\rreputable independent mechanic who said \\rthe car looked like it had 150K on it \\rwhen it barely has 50K - catalytic \\rconverter, control arm bushings, engine \\rmounts, rear disc differentials, oxygen \\rsensor and more.  He recommended I take \\rit back to the dealer.  The dealer said \\rit wasn\\'t their problem.  Audi refuses \\rto cover everything except the \\rcatalytic converter.  I\\'m now looking \\rat $4K worth of maintenance.   A cute, exciting lemon This car is lots of fun to drive and \\rthe front seats are reasonably \\rcomfortable.  The rear seats are \\rreally only for children and small \\radults.  Unfortunately, as soon as \\rthis car came out of warranty numerous \\rproblems cropped up.  Audi USA has \\rbeen nothing short of terrible in \\rterms of responding to our concerns.  \\rNo more audis for us.  I would suggest \\ronly purchasing this car with an \\rextended warranty that includes \\rcoverage for gaskets and leaks. 1999 Audi A4 1.8T This is a GREAT car. This car handles\\rlike it is on rails if you have the\\rsport suspension. Ride is a bit hard if\\ryou have the sports package. The engine\\ris very powerful for its size, and it\\rgets great fuel economy.  Love hate relationship You can\\'t find a more satisfying car on \\rthe road.  Exceptional handling, great \\rfor long trips on the freeway, and nice \\rlooks.   A wonderful car A comfortable, solid car that is fun to\\rdrive and excellent in the snow. Exellent Car I just purchased this car it only has \\r38,000 miles on it and I love driving \\rit. Style,comfort,handling is great. I \\rowned prior to this a 1993 Mercedes \\r190E and this auto does not compare! \\rOnly thing I would have liked in the \\rAudi is a CD player it comes with a \\rcassette AM/FM radio, other than that \\rcar is GREAT!!! High-speed Cruiser I\\'ve put 4K on this car since I \\rpurchased it three months ago.  One \\rtrip from Denver to Utah and several \\rtrips into the mountains have been \\rextremely enjoyable.  This car is at \\rhome with high speeds.  I have the 5-\\rspeed, but test drove the tiptronic 2.8 \\rand the new 1.8T 5-speed.  The 2.8 5-\\rspeed had the best acceleration and \\rsense of control to reach optimum \\rtorque on uphill climbs.  I\\'m looking \\rforward to see how quattro does in the \\rsnow, which is a main reason I \\rpurchased the car. Awesome Car Never had a problem with it.  The AWD  Performance at an affordable price Made a good decision to purchase this  Huge Disappointment Wish I\\'d stuck with the BMW. This car has \\rbeen nothing but trouble from day 1. \\rTransmission replaced before 1K miles, \\rwindshield cracked (sitting in a garage), air \\rconditioning controls failed, instrument \\rcluster unit failed, windshield washer pump, \\rtransmission again, squeaks & rattles that \\rcan\\'t be fixed....... Only buy if a factory certified car... Bought used as a factory certified car, \\r2yr/100k warranty. Unfortunately had to \\ruse the warranty several times. New \\rturbo, new sunroof, a new rear speaker, \\rnew seals on awd axles, new mass air \\rflow sensor. otherwise, a great car. My \\rfirst German car, always had Japanese, \\rnot used to the niggling problems. It \\ris quiet, great on the highway, the \\rquattro is great can even notice in the \\rrain turning corners. Only gets 21mpg \\raround town (premium gas only). Love \\rthe way the car looks, get a lot of \\rcomplements. Fast car for only having \\r150hp.   Love my A4 I bought this car about a year ago and \\rlove it.  The AWD is fantastic - I \\rdon\\'t like to drive cars without it \\rnow.  The 99.5 has a reconfigured front \\rcabin with a conveniently placed \\rcupholder - if you have a choice, go \\rfor the newer one. BH+AP This car is great. i loovveed it.it  wonderful car    I bought this car with 1800 miles on \\rit.  I don\\'t think I could have \\rswallowed the price of a new one, but \\rthe 3 year(at that time-now it\\'s 4)\\rcomplete warranty was reassuring.  It\\'s \\ra blast to drive.  The quattro is \\rmandatory in the snow belt.  I put 4 \\rMichelin snows on in the winter, and go \\ranywhere without worry. Second time around I bought this car after a successful \\rfirst run with a 1996 Quattro.  This \\rcar has been great in Boston weather, \\rand outperforms anything else I have \\rdriven in poor conditions.  It\\'s also \\rbeen reliable, and a value for such \\rluxury. I\\'d buy another. Excellent car So far this car is making my heart \\rpound. It is quick, comfortable, well \\rbuilt, and very attractive to the eye. \\rEvery attention to detail has been made \\rby Audi! Best $28,000 ever spent on a car! This was my first new car, initially \\rpurchased to get through the VT winters.\\rI have been on road trips from Quebec \\rCity to New York, New England to Texas \\rand Texas to Colorado. It excells in \\rthe snow (with proper tires), handles \\rvery well (sport suspension) and is a \\rvery good highway cruiser (despite the \\rhigh rpm\\'s in 5th).\\r  So Far, So Good!!! I recently purchased my 99 1/2 2.8 \\rQuattro 5 spd. and love it (1,000 miles \\rin just over a week).  I drove a 1.8T \\rand my 6 cylinder is much smoother and \\rmuch quieter.  I also recommend the 5 \\rspd. if you enjoy really \\'driving\\' your \\rcar.  The tiptronic seems sloppy on \\rupshifts and just doesn\\'t have hand\\'s \\ron feel of the manual.  The quattro \\rglues the car to the road no matter the \\rconditions, a must here in Utah.  I \\rtraded in a \\'98 Mercedes C280 Sport and \\rmy Audi not only outperforms the MB \\rit\\'s interior is also more luxurious in \\rmy opinion. audi a4 I love this car.  Very reliable, very fun to drive, it is my daily driver as well as my weekend autocross car.  Takes everything I dish out and only asks regular maintenance in return. Quality, Fun, Look ...this car has it all.\\rI recommend the 1.8T over the 2.8, b/c \\rthe turbo engine is fabulous and it\\'s \\ralso lighter (4 vs 6 cyl) which \\rprovides the car with an outstanding \\rweight balance. Great car for the price There are a few minor things that could \\rbe done to make this car the best small \\rsedan on the road. It is unbeatable for \\rthe price. I love the A4 and haven\\'t \\rseen any car that is a better value.  \\rThe car\\'s interior looks and feels like \\rcars of twice the price, it is \\rexcellent other than the rear seat room.\\r Still great after all these years I\\'ve owned this car since bought new in late \\r1998, and I remaian as pleased as when I \\rpurchased it.  No mechanical issues despite \\rnearly 60,000 commute miles, and it has \\rheld up well consmetically as well.  My \\rdaughter looks forward to when it can be her \\rcar (in five years when she gets her license!) Love At 1st Sight! Why buy a rear wheel drive BMW when you \\rcan get an AWD Audi? Great value for \\rwhat you\\'re paying for. Quattro is a \\rgod send in snowy New England. The Bose \\rSound System is a gem! 6 Disk changer \\rin the trunk in only a minor \\rinconvenience. The interior is \\rcomfortable and stylish. My friends \\rcan\\'t get over all the gadgets to play \\rwith, expecially the heated front \\rseats. The exterior design is beautiful \\ras it is. Who really needs a spoiler or \\rbody kits anyway? The certified \\rwarranty it came with is decent \\r(100,000 or 2 years). I would recommend \\rthis car to anyone! Highs and Lows My wife is the primary driver of this \\rcar and loves the handling.  She loves \\rthe suspension and the ability to \\rnavigate anywhere in the snow.  The \\rdowner is that as soon as the warranty \\rexpired, so did the car.  $1000 in \\rrepairs in the last 9 months. Fun car! Unreliable. At 23,000 miles, 20 days after the \\rwarranty expired, the water pump \\rseized up and destroyed the engine. \\rAudi rebuilt the engine and covered \\rthe cost. Whew! Audi service is \\rwonderful (at least at Barrier Motors \\rin Bellevue, WA) Since then the car is \\rmore reliable but continues to have \\rsmall problems beyond the usual Audi \\rissues.\\r That said, I love the look and feel of \\rthe car and will buy another Audi -- \\rprobably the all road or the A6 Avant. \\r The Audi visual appeal exceeds that of \\rBMW. Excellent Car, fun to Drive In auto, the car is somewhat doggish \\rfrom the start, and even in 1st gear \\rmanual mode it takes off a bit slow.\\rOnce it shifts into 2nd, it is pretty \\rgood. That little 4 cylinder does the \\rjob. It is not as smooth as the 2.8, \\rhowever it is not so noticeable at \\rhigher speeds. Once this thing wakes it \\rcruises like a much larger engine.  \\rThe mileage however is similar to my 6 \\rcyl engines in the city, averaging \\rbetween 18 and 24 mpg depending how you \\rdrive.  I can get 34 mpg! When doing \\rbetween 100-115 for a couple hours \\rstraight, I will average around 26-28. \\rMileage could be better for a small \\rengine, but you are pushing a heavy car \\rwith 4 wheel drive with it.

Handles well, \\raccelleration is great with the \\rTiptronic.  Insurance rates decent Forget about a Bimmer. This is better I test-drove the 328, and all things \\rconsidered , the Audi is better value \\rfor the money. It will run rings around \\rthe Bimmer in bad weather. There are a \\rlot of neat features to learn about \\ronce you buy one. The downside is that \\rthe back seats are somewhat cramped. \\rI\\'m 6\\'1\" though, and the front seats \\rare fine for me. Not as good as they say Most things with this vehicle are good, \\rbut the bad things are very annoying. \\rTiptronic which shifts too soon and \\rcan\\'t make up its mind what gear to be \\rin. Brake pads which bind in their \\rseats. Brake discs warping. \\rUnfortunately, it is a blast to drive. Shhhh...Great Car This is a great handling car! Ya really \\rdo look at curvy roads and smile just \\rlike a commercial. Passing acceleration \\ris a delight. Sometimes ya just pass \\rbecause it&#8217;s fun! Fit and finish are \\rtypical German solid. Bose radio is \\rfantastic.  Sounds great at any volume, \\rweather it&#8217;s heavy metal or smooth \\rjazz. I love the little things that car \\rsalesmen never talk about like \\rwindshield wipers that slow down when \\rthe car does.  You&#8217;re going to love \\rthis car a little more every time you \\rdrive it. Superb quality --Excellent manufacturing quality\\r--Fun to drive.  Go for the Turbo \\rengine over the 2.8V6: cheaper, lighter \\rengine (4 vs. 6 cyl), sportier.  You \\rreally don\\'t feel the hp difference! So sweeet! Sweet ride.  Handles great, a blast to \\rdrive.  Suggest getting some bolt-ons \\rfor that lag between the turbo (before \\r2800rpm.  Hot interior,  Great engine.  \\rI fell in love the second I drove one. love my audi i bought my 991/2 audi a4 for my wife, \\rneedless to say she has\\'nt driven it \\rmuch!  i will come up with places to go \\rjust to drive my a4.  i love the ride \\rbut im just a little worried what the \\rcost of repairs will cost. I\\'ve loved this car... ...it\\'s going off lease in 3 months and \\rit will be a sad parting.  Luckily the \\rnew A4 has a new body style (and \\rhopefully more room in the back \\rseat??)  All in all this has been a \\rgreat car.  Very fun to drive, sporty, \\reye-catching and reliable.  Only a \\rcouple of minor problems (a timing \\rissue, cruise control switch, and the \\rheadlamp washer hose).  Highly \\rrecommended vehicle. LOVE MY CAR This is the best car that I have ever  Awesome car! Audis are very popular in Seattle area \\rbut get no respect in LA area.  So \\rbought 99 1/2 with 40k miles and \"2 yr \\rAudi Assured\" from dealer after \\rhearing reliability probs.  This is \\rawesome car...  More I drive more I \\rlike.  I didn\\'t care for BMW 3 series \\rstyling and came across too many rude \\rpeople with attitude drying beamers.  \\rC class is not sporty enough for me so \\rAudi with its good looks was the car \\rfor me. Best Entry Euro Sports Sedan There is very little I do not like \\rabout this car.  The turbo engine (w/ \\rperformance chip 200hp 235lbs/ft \\rtorque) is awesome.  Handling is superb \\rboth wet and dry, in the snow (under 3-\\r4\") I would take this car over anything \\relse on the road.  I went by SUV\\'s in \\rthe ditch at 55mph on I-95.  I also \\rlove the classic, elegant, styling of \\rthe car both inside and out, there is \\rno need for the add on ground effects, \\rwings etc. other manufacturers need to \\ruse to make there cars stand out. AUDI has perfected the A4 at this point Audi has had several years to perfect this model without a major redesign.  This car has no weaknesses, other than a higher initial price and expected higher charge from the dealer for service.  It is a Germanic import after all.  My CPO will pay for the next three major service intervals, so that is around $1500 I won\\'t pay   for, minus the $85 deductible each time.  An investment with style. So far, exceeding all expectations and then som This is one fine example of German automotive engineering and technology.  In the month I\\'ve had it, it\\'s delivered everything it promised, and a lot more.  Can\\'t say enough good things about this car.  Handles wonderfully, no matter what mode it\\'s in.  I prefer sports mode because it suits my driving style best, but ordinary Drive mode is nice when just cruising on the freeway and getting 30+mpg.  I\\'m averaging 29 miles per gallon, city and freeway, much better than expected and far exceeding what my V6 Honda ever got, even with cylinder deactivation.  Accelerates very smoothly, just a hint of a pause and then it kind of \"jumps \" off the line and up to speed seemingly instantly.  Feels much faster than what is written, and probably is. Definitely under 6 seconds to 60mph, but that\\'s not what they say.  Very happy with the transission and wouldn\\'t have got the car with a CVT, so it was a Quattro or a different make.  A bit hard to find in my targeted budget range, with the trim and color I wanted, but persistence, hard work, and determination paid off....and the willingness to travel over a hundred miles.  Kudos to Circle Audi of Long Beach for sending me a Uber ride to get there, and treating me well at the dealer.  No \"over the top\" selling with these guys, straight to the point and excellent product knowledge, what\\'s you definitely want in a salesperson.  I laid out my specs to them, they found me the perfect car right away and got me the kind of deal I was happy with.  Such a great deal I don\\'t want to say what it is, and it\\'s a certified pre-owned Audi with some warranty, always a plus with a used car.  Thought I would miss my old car, and I do a little, but I\\'ve found a new love and her name is Audi Quattro. I\\'m hooked and as long as maintainance is low and the car remains dependable, I\\'ll be in Audis for the foreseeable future.  All the car reviews of this car were spot on, and maybe even a little underwhelming for this car.  I can\\'t really say anything negative about any aspect of the vehicle, only that the steering is a bit too soft at times and combine that ease of steering with how well the car moves and you have to be very careful not to change lanes by mistake because you turned your writ a half centimeter...it\\'s that precise and easy to turn.  Sport mode firms it up a bit, but still very effortless and I like more of a road feel in my hands.  I like to drive, not be driven by my car. This car has both available, which is nice.  Electronics were simple to learn, navigation is so precise it\\'s scary, and nothing feels cheap and not corners seem cut, to save a few bucks and annoy the consumer.  I\\'m a big fan of companies wh \"tighten all the bolts\" and aren\\'t lazy, and cheap, about quality.  Nothing rattles, and exterior noise is virtually eliminated.  Engine has a nice little growl to it that\\'s not over the top, but just loud enough to tell you that it\\'s no ordinary 4 cylinder under the hood.  No sound of the turbo at all, which is really amazing, you really don\\'t know it\\'s there until the toque really kicks in and speed jumps up pretty fast.  I have to really pay attention, or I may be getting speeding tickets because you definitely don\\'t feel the high speed, and 65 doesn\\'t feel all that different from 100....not that I\\'ve ever gone that fast, but to illustrate.... Thanks Audi for a fine automobile.  I\\'m very happy with it so far. So much fun to drive!! I purchased a used 2014 Audi A4 premium plus quatro about a month ago.  So far, I love it!  I specifically wanted a manual transmission, because I just love shifting gears.  This car is a blast to drive and shift!  I previously owned a VW Passat, which I was pleased with, but have really enjoyed a slight \"step up\" to the Audi.  The car handles very well, I love the side assist (blinking lights when someone is in your blind spot and your blinker is on), the auto-sensing wipers (never have to touch the wiper level!!), and the overall feel of the car.  It is very \"sturdy\" and quiet.  My Passat was really noisy, so this was a great change.  I also love the push-button start and the push-button parking brake (no more difficult parking brake to wrestle with!)  My VW had the old-fashioned remote key lock and unlock, and I love that with my Audi, I just have to reach for the handle - as long as the key is in my purse, the car will unlock for me.  No more searching for my keys in the bottom of my purse!!!!!  Now for the disappointments: first, even though I have the premium plus, there is no back-up camera.  I knew this before I bought, but was told by the salesman that I could easily add one from Best Buy for about $250.  I looked into it (before purchasing the car), and it looked like he was right.  However, when I went to BB to get the back-up camera, I found out that these after-market accessories cannot be added to a factory-installed monitor without a VERY expensive adapter (like, over $1,000)!  So... now I have to live without a back-up camera.  I also don\\'t like the radio selection on the steering column.  Instead of just pushing a button to move from one preset station to the next (like in my VW), you have to roll a little knob to select the station, and then push the button.  It\\'s almost impossible to do this without looking at the dashboard.  It takes my eyes and attention off the road.  Also, I\\'m disappointed in the bluetooth voice command.  In my VW, my phone book contacts from my phone were automatically recognized by my car.  All I had to say was, call Samantha Anderson (or any contact in my phone\\'s contact list), and it dialed the number.  With the Audi, I have to actually pre-record a voice tag for Samantha Anderson and input her number, or it won\\'t recognize and call.  I was really shocked by these downgrades.  The Audi is supposed to be a step up, and it is in most ways, but definitely some technology oversights that are surprising.  Some other features that are very important to me: a very big trunk and seats that fold down (very easy to maneuver), seat memory, seat heat, and a rockin\\' sound system!!  Although there are a few technological features that I would change, I LOVE the A4!!!! great balance Just a great balance of features, performance, economy, comfort in a good looking package.  Black with sports pkg and black optic package. 24 mpg around area, 31-32 mpg on long trips.  4cyl turbo does really well on the move.  6 spd manual involving and smooth/precise.  room for 4 adults without stuffing them in. bang and Olufsen system if very good Smoothest car After owning a few BMWs and a Lexus, I was dead set on getting something cheaper. Walked into the dealer to buy a GTI and left with a 2014 A4 with the Black Optics package. First off - astounding looking car. Audi has come a long way from the \\'bubbly\\' design of early 2000s. Secondly, it\\'s the smoothest car I\\'ve ever driven. That\\'s coming from someone who owned a 550, 135 and RX over the past decade. It\\'s undoubtedly due to the higher torque at lower revs as well as amazing steering feel. One thing I wished: I think the car could do with a bit more power at the higher end (3-4k revs); but it doesn\\'t necessarily need it for most Americans\\' driving style.Overall, amazing car, buy it and don\\'t worry about a thing. great new toy Long term ex-Acura guy who loves manual transmissions. I really don\\'t understand where Acura is shifting its target demographics, which is a pity, as they used to have such sweet packages. They no longer offer manual transmissions in cars worth buying.After long research the manual A4 quattro hit the sweet spot for features, quality and price. Drove one and got instantly hooked. So much technology, so nicely packaged on top of a mechanically exquisite car. A car that shares an engine and transmission with the Golf GTI, but packaged so much better. A blast to drive._____________________________________________________________Update after 2.5 years of ownership. Still enjoying the car, although the wife drives it more frequently these days. In the meantime I also acquired a BMW M235i, which I love, but that only completes my car ownership experience between the two cars. Audi is still the more comfortable and the go to car for any longer family trip. The BMW is the car to be in when alone and on shorter trips. The Audi is for family trips and for when I\\'m getting tired of the firmer BMW ride. Audi has a great suspension, firm enough to have an adequate attitude, but soft enough to be comfortable in most conditions. With good winter tires Audi is unbeatable in snow and ice. You don\\'t get the thrills of the BMW acceleration, and precise handling, but you don\\'t need that most of the time, and what you get in the Audi is plenty adequate for a very decent price. I also love the Quattro Torsen implementation. I just can\\'t understand why Audi is messing up with such a great system for the more complex and likely less reliable Haldex in the newer designs. BTW, when researching my BMW I rode all sorts of other cars. I just can\\'t go back to the over pampered and mushy experience in the Japanese cars. Don\\'t get me wrong, they\\'re great for the right people, just not for me. Former Bimmer fan Previous to this A4, I have owned 3 BMW 3 series vehicles.  I loved Bimmers and thought that I would drive them for life.\\r My wife needed a new car and we test drove the 3 series, but they seemed to have lost so much feel.  They just aren\\'t what they used to be.\\r Then we drove the quattro.  Man, what a ride.  It blows the Bimmer out of the water.  It may not be as fast 0-60, but feels better in every other regard.  It corners better, it has a slightly stiffer suspension, and hugs the road like a bear.\\r If you are thinking about a Bimmer, do yourself a favor and test drive a quattro.  \\r  P.S. If you go A4, go quattro or go home. After a thorough search, this is what I found This is my 3rd installment of reviews of my 2014 Audi A4 Premium Plus.  I was envious of the 2017 A4\\'s engine output and torque figures. I mentioned it to the tech and while having the car serviced. He said, \"Just chip it!\" So, I did. In July of 2017 with 88,800 miles on the car, I went with the Stage 1 ECU upgrade from APR (goapr.com). The power improvement is immediately noticeable, and it\\'s addictive. Once you get used to the improved performance it\\'s not easy going back to the stock configuration. Just to be cautious I do revert to \\'normal\\' engine mode every so often. The \\'chip\\' has 4 modes: 93 Octane; 91 Octane; Valet [which restricts speed to 30 MPH] and Normal or Stock. My fuel efficiency has decreased as expected, but it actually improves when I run on cruise control for long distances.  I cannot accurately note the loss of efficiency because I went from Pirelli P7 Cinturato Low Rolling Resistance tires to Michelins Pilot Sport A/S 3+. Before having the chip installed I noticed a decrease in fuel efficiency with the change in tires. I\\'m still loving this car. A friend of mine, who happens to be an executive with Enterprise Holdings and is always driving the latest and greatest that the company has to offer, get\\'s in and says, \"Ya know, I like this car!\" And believe me, this friend is NOT free and easy with compliments. I have 102,000 miles on the car. I am meticulous about maintenance and Keeping the car clean and shiny.  I was honestly looking at another Audi, but realized I\\'m gonna entire soon and will most likely keep this one as long as I can.  Still Enjoy This Automobile!My original review, made shortly after purchase follows this updated review.  I have owned the 2014 Premium Plus version of Audi\\'s A4 for 30 months and 76,000 miles.  I still Love this car! I learned  of an issue with deposits accumulating on the intake valves of direct injected turbocharged engines.  I learned of some measures to reduce this accumulation and so far so good.  Performance remains consistent i.e. very much the same as when I first began driving the car.  I do my own oil changes at 5K mile intervals. I did notice that the HVAC unit seems to blow cold air when I wanted heat.  I mentioned this when I a had the car serviced. The technician assured me that all was as it should be. At my last service there was an update to the programming of the HVAc unit addressing the issue that I had identified earlier. The dual zone climate control now works as prescribed.   We looked at the new A4 but, in terms of styling, it seems dull compared to the 2014 (B8). Tires and wheels have been an issue as having never had blowout nor wheel damage I never anticipated a need for a wheel and tire warranty.  With the 18\" wheels, I purchased a new set of tires in six months. I\\'ve also had to have 3 wheels straightened at that place in Bath PA. Glad they\\'re close by. I\\'m headed there again at the end of this month. Other than that there have been no issues. The car still gets nods and \\'nice car\\' comments. And most of all, \"I STILL THOROUGHLY ENJOY DRIVING THIS CAR!!! Still feels good every time I get in. Color me \\'Happy\\'! Here\\'s my original review:Just purchased a 2014 A4. The driving dynamics are amazing and better than the new BMW\\'s. I have driven performance cars all my life and the handling of this car is sublime. The styling is subtle and elegant. The engine lacks the sonorous qualities of more performance oriented vehicles but given the plebeian power figures the car moves with an alacrity and agility that genuinely impresses; credit the 8 speed Steptronic transmission. Steering, while a bit numb is direct and precise. That\\'s all I need from a sedan. Amenities abound and present themselves when you least expect them. It\\'s like an Armani suit, the closer you look at the details the more beautiful touches you find. The A4 IMHO blends Power Elegance and Beauty like few automobiles ever have. Love this car!!!OKAY! Here we are at 86,600 miles....and I\\'m still in love with my A4. Nothing much has changed at all. I have had no issues with the mechanics of the car and she still turns heads and gets the occasional envious glance if not an outright thumbs up.  I purchased a new set of Michelins as opposed to the OEM Pirelli\\'s, which featured low rolling resistance.  I notice an increase in fuel consumption. of about 2 or 3 MPG.  But the Michelins feel softer and offer more feedback and about the same grip. Two for the road Within 2 weeks of buying our A4 we took it on a 5000 mile tour to see friends and family.The car handles like a sports car but offers as comfortable and quiet ride as a limo.Despite driving in several Western States with speed limits of either 70 or 75 mph, we managed a 31+ mpg figure and that includes driving over both the Sierra and Rocky Mountains. New a4 premium plus Just traded in my 2011 A5. The difference is dramatic. Bought with every possible upgrade. If you like a hard drive German machine this is it. I tested the A6 and thought I was in a Lexus. I got the black optics pkg with 19\" wheels. I love the hard feel. Plenty of power. I put the car in dynamic mode and it reminds me of my 1970 TR6. It\\'s a blast. Ok so it\\'s not as pretty as my A5 but it drives like a sports car. The downside is all the electronics. Way to difficult to master. But if pure driving is what your looking for you found it. To update my listing. MPG not what I had expected. Only getting about 26.5 . Very disappointed with the summer tire I just had to replace @ 21,000. Car could use some more HP. Otherwise the car still runs and looks great. Debating moving away from Audi when lease is up. This is my 4 Audi in a row. Possibly moving to Lexus as the BMW\\'s are just too small. Oil Oil Oil and it beeps too much If you want a car that needs lots of oil, like a Qt once a month and that beeps a lot, (why) this is it/Looks awesome, drives great and good in the snow (with snow tires) but it drinks oil and Audi of America will not fix the cars.Any Audi/VW with the 2.0T will consume oil.Up to 1 Qt every 1000 mi.Do the math, then but a Japanese or American car.I have had Audis for 20 years and this is it,Done.... Oh,If you open the door there is a loud beep/ warning that door open lights on, seatbelt,Gets old quick.Also controls for heat/radio/phone are too complicated with several clicks to get where you want.no \"one touch\" options. A4 avant prestige sport 19 inch need a family car.thought about s4 but thought the avant was more practical.did not want a suv - simply more weight and a higher center of gravity leads to a dull driving exp.Any audi you but you must get the sports package and quattro otherwise you might as well buy something else.The car i got is loaded - prestige- b & o radio makes a big difference, side assist, etc.The steering is a little light but the handling is very good overall.the engine is more than adequate.i was concerned about this - previous car i had delivered 330 hp.i notice the difference but the overall package of the audi is excellent.This is what you get when you buy an audi - great overall package Love this car I Never thought I would go for a wagon, but coming out of an SUV I am amazed at how fun this car is to drive.  The fuel economy is excellent and the 4C turbo has plenty of power.  Audi manages to make a true sport wagon that looks cool and performs like a world-class sport sedan.  I looked at the BMW 328 wagon, Audi is larger and better equipped for the $ and much faster with the turbo.    2011 A4 T2.0 Premium Do your research about the cvt transmission and maintenance on this vehicle if you\\'re interested in purchasing. Bought a new car- not enough power- to expensive t Dealing with Audi, their staff is just an awful. Besides the fact that their ethics with the emissions issue speaks for itself. It will be my last Audi/Volkswagon car I buy Failed Turbo before 100k Miles The car has performed well but the repair costs are expensive and failures are occurring on a well kept vehicle under 100k miles. The car had oil leaking issues, which was solved and covered by Audi, a failed air condition unit at 60k miles and now at 83k miles a failed Turbo which is very expensive. Best all around for sport and luxury My 2011 Audi A4 has been a great all around car for someone looking for luxury and sport.  The S-Line interior is amazing and the sport seats are extremely comfortable and supportive.  The turbocharged four-cylinder engine is decent but you will suffer slight turbo lag and it can\\'t compare to the supercharged six-cylinder in the S4.  I drove the 328i/335i, C300, IS 250, and G37 and decided the A4 was the best car at combining fun-to-drive, nice interior and exterior design, fuel economy, and technology.  My one disappointment is the fuel economy--only 23.3 mpg over 62,000 miles of mixed driving (almost all driving in regular \"D\" mode; I rarely put it into sport mode).  The car has been reliable with only two non-routine repairs, both of which happened in the last 10,000 miles.  I\\'m very happy with the car and am looking at the new \"B9\" A4 to replace this one. My first Audi! Been wanting an Audi since I was a kid.  This one is my first, although it is used.  A mint condition 2011 with 41k miles bought in early 2016.I REALLY debated over getting rid of my Ram pick-up, paid off mind you, for a few years of monthly payments.  The monthly payments are well within my comfort zone, so I\\'m not crying poor mouth, but I\\'m the frugal type and view the payments as opportunity cost.As with any car purchase...........do your homework.  As previously mentioned, years 2009 through 2011 are known for oil consumption issues (turbo engines only).  This alone caused me severe pause.  Not only did I go over the Carfax (work related to fixing this issue will be there if done by a reputable dealer) with a fine tooth comb, I actually called the shop, also on the Carfax, where my vehicle received all of it\\'s milestone check-ups and spoke to the service people.  They were kind enough to review the service history of my vehicle with me.  My Audi has never been in for oil consumption problems.  The service person told me that it was unlikely that I\\'d experience this given the mileage......it should have popped up by now.   I also called Audi of America and confirmed that Audi has agreed to cover all repairs related to the oil consumption issue for 8 years or 80,000 miles.  Whichever comes first.  So with that final nugget of information I took the plunge.The car rides wonderfully and is extremely comfortable.  It took a while to get used to all of the buttons and gizmos (my A4 is a loaded premium package) but I feel so spoiled now when driving.I absolutely love the AWD (Quattro) but have noticed understeer when hitting a corner a little too hot.  It\\'s not horrible, but you do need to muscle up a bit when turning into a corner at an above average rate of speed.  Very satisfied and am hoping that this is my starter car for what will be a long relationship with Audi. Nothing like a manual! I bought an audi A4 premium AWD certified vehicle because it was the only upscale vehicle still available with a manual transmission.   The car handles great and is fun to drive.  I highly recommend this car.  Before this car,  I  had a basic model that was totaled.  The car saved my life. I  was disappointed in this model but my new certified pre-owned has all the features my basic car lacked.  It is a premium plus.  I love the back up camera and split backseats.  I have to have an AWD car because I live in a very hilly area and it handles great in the snow! No major repairs I am very pleased with my A4 overall. I love driving it -- the car scoots and turns corners like it\\'s on rails. I don\\'t drive fast enough to notice any understeer, which is reportedly present (CD). Only two minor complaints: First, it uses oil. In the two years I\\'ve owned it, only two extra quarts, but still extra oil. Second, the radio has an inexplicable quirk. I regularly (read always) listen to an AM talk-radio station. Once in a while - it seems to correspond to cold wet weather - the sound flops from low to high volume. The amount of flop seems to correspond to the settings that specify how much the radio sound is turned down when the parking sensors are doing their job. But the parking sensors are not on and it only weirds out on the one station; others play just fine. I guess as long as you don\\'t listen to talk radio, this is not an issue. Note: The dealer couldn\\'t figure it out and was not interested in fixing it, despite it being under full warranty when I took it in. That didn\\'t please me much. I\\'ll buy my new 2017 Q5 somewhere else.I repeat -- I absolutely love this car -- more room than a BMW 3-series and just as fun to drive. 2011 Audi A4 have faulty rings and burn oil This is a known issue - just goggle Audi A4 oil consumption problems and you will see.Audi has refused a recall and the fix - new rings and pistons - costs between $6000 - $7000.It\\'s really disappointing that Audi has not stepped up to address this on a broader scale. Used to love Audis :(  It absolutely breaks my heart to write this review (seriously, I\\'m emotionally attached to my Audis)... I have been driving Audi/VW for the past 15-16 years. This was my first new Audi purchase (I had previously bought used). Car was AWESOME for the first 1.5 years. In the past 6 months it has started an problem burning/consuming oil. First, I had to add one quart of oil between changes (every 5000 miles), which we are told is within spec for this Audi. It has progressively gotten worse and is now burning so much I have to add a quart every 750 miles. Audi would not do an oil consumption test until it got BELOW 800 miles. IF Audi fixes the problem, I think I\\'ll have to switch brands. :(  Great Car Loved this car. Had it for two years and 20K miles and had no problems. Decided to try something new but then was kicking myself and missing my Audi. Enjoyed the handling and speed and the pick-up. It felt like a race car, even though it looked like a sedan. I had absolutely no problems with this car, although I did have to add half a quart of oil at about 8K and 18K miles -- very minor and not a problem at all. UPDATE: Missed it so much I got back in an A4 quattro. I\\'m enjoying it now, especially in sport driving mode. Still love this car, but only with quattro! Great car with one fatal flaw for long distance commuters I was looking for entry level luxury sedan. I drove Infiniti G35 and Audi A4. Planned to test BMW and Mercedes as well but liked A4 so much that I just bought it. After driving for four months and more than 6000 miles, I am not sure if it was the right decision. I am 5\\' 11\\'\\' 175lbs male. I drive 38 miles one way to work. The front seats are comfortable but once I adjust my seat I cannot rest either the left elbow or the right elbow to be able to hold the steering comfortably. The placement of the elbow support on the left hand side is especially bad. It is too far away from the elbow and is not useable. Even the right elbow support is not great but not as bad as left one. Very good value for the money We purchased a brand new 2011 Audi 4 with the Premium package and so far 12K miles on it. After test driving BMW 3 series (even the Diesel), and Mercedes Benz C class (which is quite boring to drive), we decided to get an Audi 4 and it\\'s been a nice ride so far. The only thing I miss (I used to own a GTI), is the fun to drive. But I surely don\\'t miss going to the dealer every month for repairs. Fun car, but build quality needs improvement This is my first Audi, and in general I am impressed.It\\'s a fun car to drive.The gas mileage is outstanding, while the engine is responsive.I think it is one of the better looking cars inside and out in the segment.However, Audi really needs to step up their build quality.I do a lot of driving and rack up miles quickly.Right now I have 15,000 miles on the car and there are rattles everywhere.Most recently on the side of the dash by the drivers side door a piece of plastic came lose.I was told by my dealer that integrity issues are only covered up to 12,000 miles, and they wouldn\\'t fix it under warranty.Really disappointing and a good way to kill a customer relationship. Spectacular Beauty I just picked up my 2011 A4 Manual Quattro and I cannot stop ogling at this car. In fact, I\\'m jealous of people outside the car because they can see how stunningly gorgeous it is. This car simply stands out as the best combination of finesse, power and style. I\\'m not sure if car designs can improve much on this overall shape because after a certain point, aesthetic appeal gets lost in radical designs. I have the premium package which does not sport the LED lights but without them, the headlights are leaner and more aggressive looking and it\\'s intense. As for the interior, it\\'s plush and solid while having being supremely user friendly after a quick run over of the controls. Had it for 6 months an still enjoy it! Car I purchased: A4 Quattro (8-speed) Premium Plus w/ sports package and all the additional \"esthetic upgrades\". I bought this car in August of \\'10. I wasn\\'t entirely sure how comfortable I was with getting a first rev. of the 8 speed. So far, so good however there are a few things I\\'ve noticed which I\\'ve listed under \"improvements\". I tried the 2011 BMW 335d, 2010 A4 Quattro, 2010 G35, 2011 ES350, 2010 C300. To be honest the acceleration of the BMW diesel and fuel economy far surpass the A4. However the A4 surpasses the BMW in a couple categories, one being safety. The other being CUP holders! High tech goodies in a great ride I\\'ve driven the 2011 A4 for 4,000 km now in a variety of weather and road conditions. Top marks so far for the very peppy turbo 2L engine, the solid but not harsh ride, quiet interior, roomy trunk, confident handling from twisty roads and sharp corners, and an entertainment system that is a match to any desktop computer. Medium marks to the odd LED daytime running lights that wink out when a turn signal is on, the turbo lag off the line, a slightly choppy 8 speed auto transmission that isn\\'t as silky as it should be, and back seats that aren\\'t quite roomy enough for the legs of taller adults. Room for improvement on head space for the driver.  Perfect Ride I went with the Prestige package, and this one came with the S Line option, and it\\'s a great car!  For those who worry about the V4 and performance - don\\'t! The engine is phenomenal and with all the torque it puts out, this car has more than enough power to make the A4 a joy to drive.  Besides, when do you get to go 0-60 on city streets during rush hour? To tell you how much I love this car, I keep getting up around 4 a.m. to take it out for an early morning drive before I have to get ready for work! Love it! This is my first Audi and I absolutely LOVE it! Before purchase I was concerned about a 4 cyl, but the turbo makes it a non issue and the gas mileage is AWESOME! The interior is extremely comfortable and well thought out. The attention to detail truly makes the car fun to drive. I\\'m officially an Audi convert. Costly to drive Bought it new 1998. Six V cylinder engine with a manual stick. Fun to drive and a lot of pep, but repairs way too much and suspension design and transmission not worthy of German engineering (mechanical engineer myself). 12 years and average maintenance/repair cost $1,000/year. First the lower suspension arms replaced, twice each side (Audi recall eventually), then new leaky radiator, wheel bearings on three wheels, timing belt and water pump at 90,000 miles, 142,000 miles new clutch ($1,300), control arm upper front, and exhaust pipe clamps (3 times) plus regular maintenance. I think this is my last Audi and I will turn it in Nice but... Nice car if you can afford the high dollar repairs. Ball joints have been a constant problem. Transmission went out completely at 80,000 miles  even though the car has been very well cared for and driven lightly. Audi Lover Cheated I have had nothing but expense after expense which is making it difficult to justify buying another Audi despite my love for the cars.  In nearly 3 years I have replaced the water pump, rear bearings, mass air sensor, power steering rack (which came from Audi faulty and was warranty replaced by local mechanic) turn signal headlight stalk, tie rod ends, sway bar links, all control arms (upper A and F R lowers), the timing belt, valve cover gaskets, mirror directional button is bad, and the car eats tires like the chocolate doughnuts I used to eat in my overweight youth. I am questioning, in anguish, the merits of fine German enigineering. Happy Audi Owner I bought my 1998 Audi A4 Avant from a dealer at with 45,000 miles on it coming of a 3 year lease.  I have only replaced the front rotors and resurfaced rear with brake new pads.  I have 75,000 miles on the car today. Maybe I\\'m lucky.  This is my 4th Audi in 12 years and the only real problem I had were the denso A/C compressors on the 90 series. $$$$ to own Beware of maintenance costs Bought the dealer\\'s demo and got the 3-\\ryear warrenty. At 45 k, the problems \\rstarted - front suspension - $ 766; tie \\rrod end and water pump - $ 1245; 60 k - \\rrear half shaft bearings - $1400; \\rtransmission valve body $ 3200 and now \\rthe ABS unit is shot and it\\'s back to \\rthe shop for another $3000. That is \\r$9611! Parts and service are very \\rexpensive! I am selling and cutting my \\rlosses. I\\'ll be buying a Honda or \\rToyota or an American car from now on. \\rWhat a piece of junk!  fun $$$$$ car  Bought this car with 40000 miles and \\rhave spent $7000 in 2 plus years \\rreplacing almost every moving part -\\rshocks,wheel bearings,ABS control \\rmodule and complete front end . Have \\rnot touched engine nor transmission and \\rhope to sell car ASAP  Avant 2.8 - thumbs up! great car, versatile and reliable. had \\rto replace all 10 suspension arms in \\rfront end which is a very well known \\rproblem on A4s. other than that it has \\rbeen a great car.Quattro goes through \\rany weather without blinking. Great Little Car Bought car Certified at 50k and have \\rhad no problems since. Now at 90k, car \\rgets even better with age. Have Volvo \\rV70R AWD and the Audi kicks butt all \\raround. A Beautiful but Unfaithful Lover This is one of the nicest cars I\\'ve \\rever driven.  The faster you go, the \\rbetter it gets - all the little rattles \\rgo away and it hugs the road \\rbeautifully.  However, this car has had \\rtoo many problems - broken ignition \\r(waited 6 months for the part), heater \\rcore failed, 2 CV boots busted, water \\rpump failed, broken radiator fan, \\rsunroof problems, remote key works only \\rwhen it feels like it.  We\\'ve taken \\rgood care of this care and done all the \\rsuggested maintenance, but it hasn\\'t \\rtaken care of us. This one\\'s good! Bought new; 69,000 miles in 5 years.\\rVery few problems, radio replaced, new\\rdash cover, all under warranty. Average\\r24 mpg in mixed use driving.

My\\rcars are very well maintained, and\\rdriven sensibly.\\r Bose stereo, driver\\'s seat, and overall\\rinterior ambience have kept me enjoying\\rthese cars for this long (8 years and\\r120,000 miles between the two). You\\'ve heard it before Bought this car used a couple of years \\rback. It was a great car, without any \\rproblems for about 8 months. Since \\rthen, it pretty much lines up with the \\rthings said in other reviews. Be \\rprepared to pay to keep it moving! It \\ris going back into the shop today (just \\rgot it back 2 weeks ago) and will \\rprobably be sold after that. 1998 A4 Avant The ride is solid, road feel is \\rexcellent and it \\rlooks great.  I purchased it used with \\r37k miles at the end of the original 4 \\ryear warranty period.  I purchased an \\rextended warranty from a local Audi \\rdealership which has paid for itself in \\rservice cost savings.  The warranty \\rcovered the instrument cluster, an oil \\rgasket leak, a cv boot and a power \\rwindow switch.  My dealer has given me \\rexcellent service and the car has held \\rup well under daily commutes in the \\rArizona heat.  The cost of wear and \\rtear maintenance is high.  Find a \\rmechanic \\rother than the dealer for the regular \\rmaintenance items. Not a grocery getter! This is an amazing car with handling, \\rpower, and all wheel drive packed in an \\rinconscpicuous wagon.  My friend just \\rpurchased a 2003 Mercedes C240 and it \\rhas been back to the shop 4 times in \\rthe first 10,000 miles.  My A4 2.8 has \\rhad minor expected repairs but it has \\rover 90,000.  I recommend replacing the \\rtiming belt before 50,000 miles, I\\'ve \\ronly heard nightmares. I also think the \\rwater pumps came from Detroit not \\rGermany. Although I will always own an \\rAudi.

Will Look Swanky in 2020 Unlike the Passat wagon, Avant styling \\ris sublime, it\\'s performance striking. \\rIt\\'s in the details. VW settled on \\raluminum roof racks, A4 goes steel. VW \\rgoes for a painfully boring interior, \\rAudi goes tight & classic. Avant is \\rdesigned with just enough room for \\rhauling, but it handles like a cool, \\rlittle sportscar. Drawbacks: no \\rbackseat space. A4 performance at low \\rspeeds is annoyingly sluggish. It zips \\rconfidently on the highway, but the \\rneighborhood runs is a crawl from 1st \\rto 2nd gear. This for a V6? The red \\rdash is cool, but tough on the eyes. My A4: I think I\\'ll keep it... I factory-ordered my A4 Avant with the \\rworks -- Pelican Blue metallic over \\rbeige leather with sunroof, sport \\rsuspension, Bose sound and (most \\rimportant) the five-speed manual. \\rAlthough I\\'ve put only 44,000 miles on \\rit in four years, I still have to say \\rthat my A4\\'s about as reliable as my \\rold Acura Integra GS-R. Small problems \\rarose at the very beginning (jammed CD \\rchanger and balky starter and cruise \\rcontrol switches) but since then its \\rbeen smooth sailing. I foresee putting \\rmany more years and miles on this \\rvehicle. Bad Dealer makes ok car not worth it. Car drives very nicely. After 35k, I have a rattle, and the exhaust system is a problem, but the car handles very well. Not quite as fast as I thought it would be, but pretty fast. The dealer, in Cherry Hill, NJ is terrible. Their services department is too small and unresponsive. They can\\'t figure out problems, and they lie about delays in returning the car. My exhaust has never been right. My hood stinks after short drives. They all know it is an exhaust problem, but they can\\'t fix it. As nice as I have been, they have failed to get it right on three visits. Love Hate Relationship This car is so much fun to drive. I bought mine used after 5-7 owners previously, and believed it to be great for the amount of work that had been put into it over the years, but I was wrong. If only i\\'d been able to see the future. I bought the car in May of 2017, and it is March of 2018. So far, there have been over $2100 in repairs, and there is still more to be done. At 20 years old, some of it is understandable, but the seats are not comfortable for the 4 hours car trips I take, and all parts cost extremely high. An MAF sensor for a Ford is around $40, but for Audi - $180. If you are considering buying it, look at the axles, and if there is a significant amount of rust on the exhaust, or a rough idle, do not buy it. Hope this helps, but for all its worth, I loved this vehicle. The old ones are more fun It is fun to drive.  Very peppy engine (V6, 5 valves per cylinder) and very slick shifting 5 spd. transmission.  Great road holding.  Short turn radius for an AWD car.  Not as luxurious as a current A4, or even A3, but a lot more fun to drive. Love my German machine You cant go wrong with an Audi Daily Driven & Canyon Carved I bought this car 2 years ago with 195000 miles on it for $2500... now I got it as a winter beater and its sole purpose was for me to have some fun in the snow.  Jump 24 months later and it\\'s almost like I have a 3rd child, I absolutely love this car!  Okay so let me start off by saying that the car was not perfect when I got it.  Be weary of coil packs and suspension components on this car.  I knew what I was getting into, because I\\'ve owned german cars before and follow car tuning forums.  So if you\\'re looking to buy this car, please get it with a carfax and buy from a responsible person.  The previous owner of my car had it for 12 years and kept it completely stock!  Since I\\'ve had it, I\\'ve upgraded to coilovers and had a performance chipped installed as well as a new diverter valve.  I did all the preventative maintenance for the car the very first month I got it.  Regardless of what the previous owner told me.. I redid the oil change, I rotated the tires and realigned the car.  I also had the car checked out by an independent Audi Specialists who personally gave me the thumbs up.  Without going into detail, I spend an additional 3k on top of the 2.5K on the car just to make sure it was in top shape.  Some of you may think I\\'m crazy.. but here\\'s the deal, at the end of the day I got a 200hp turbo, all wheel drive, stick shift, german car for $5500 with no check engine lights, no oil leaks, no ABS issues, no airbag lights... no regrets!  The car is an absolute blast to drive, what\\'s so great about it, is that you won\\'t catch any attention and you won\\'t have a car that looks like everyone has one.  In my opinion the car looks beautiful and is so very simple.  BTW I\\'ve driven this car on Angeles Crest on many occasions and not once has it ever over heated or gave me trouble.  Excellent car for tuners and a great car for someone who just wants to have a fun driving experience with the added safety of the quattro system.  Before I conclude this brief review, I must let everyone know that this car will treat you right BUT you must treat it right, meaning you must keep it fed with premium gas as well as use only synthenic oil and OEM fluids.  Please please please don\\'t cheap out on these things.  My Audi as 210000 miles and is still on the original stock turbo. 2.8l Quattro I love my a4. I bought it used over a year ago, and haven\\'t had too spend TOO much money fixing it up. Of course, some things have gone wrong, but thanks to a large internet owner\\'s community, you can easily fix many problems yourself if you are willing to learn some DIY. I have never once regretted buying it. My 5th German car and best yet! I bought this car with 113k on the clock and it is in great condition. It has 125k on it now and I intend to drive it till 400k if it\\'ll let me. The v6 engine is awesome but know you are not getting any modification potential other than exhaust. Performance chips are worthless for this engine. It corners great for a bigger car and the torque this engine provides makes it great for around town driving. This is my first lux AWD sedan and with the 5spd it is easily my favorite car owned so far. Very sleek exterior and interior. The build quality is top notch and the 2.8 has been extremely reliable as long as you keep up with maintenance. I couldn\\'t have bought a better car. Tons of fun! I bought my A4 2.8Q brand new. Over 13 years later I couldn\\'t be much happier. It drives like new with over 120k miles on it. It is great fun to drive and I love carving through the mountain snow here in Utah with only all-season tires. I had some front suspension issues until my local mechanic solved what my dealer could not. I have had my brakes done once with that same mechanic for about $600 for all four.I have replaced all four lower door trim pieces and both heated side view mirrors but no sensor or engine issues. It runs smooth and hard and I love it!My kids don\\'t like the back seat but that is what the Odyssey is for. I wish I could afford a new one. An all around great car! Great Buy Bought it with 129,000 miles on it. After buying it, spent few grand on regular maintenance (timing belt, fluid flushes, water pump) none of those thing were needed, but I was looking to keep it for long time. Currently has 140,000 miles on it. It has been very reliable for me ever since I bought it. Only thing I had to fix after I bought it, was wheel bearing and valve cover gasket set. I have many after market parts on it such as (performance chip, borla exhaust, itg air filter, etc) the gas mileage has been decent. 18-20 city and 26-31+ highway. Which I think its great for an all wheel drive car. I will drive it till wheels fall off. Love my AUDI A4 1.8 AWD I love my car. I have owned it for over a year and it still runs like a champ. Thankfully the people I bought it from took very good care of the car, and I have continued the same maintenance. It has great gas mileage, and is a beautiful car. It doesn\\'t have the power when you first hit the gas pedal but once your moving it goes.  Great quality, reliable, fun to drive. I have driven my pearl white Audi for about 3 months now. Before this Audi, I was driving a 2002 Volvo S60 (great car also). I have all factory packages that were available for this car. My car has a 30v V6 which sounds lovely before 4k rpms, after that, it builds up this roar, all the way to redline of 6800. The sport package is outstanding (if you prefer comfort, you wouldn\\'t like it). The sport seats are somewhat hard but support you when entering a corner at 40+mph. Suspension is a bit harsh too but the car handles like it is on rails. Cruising at 80mph is a breeze and my friends can\\'t even tell we\\'re going 80. Take care of it, it will last forever! Sweet and solid 2.8 5 speed I have read reviews about expenses. One person spent 3,000 on brakes, tires and rear wheel bearings, try finding a honest local repair shop. Max on that bill should be 750. Tires and brakes are consumables. I had two upper control arms put in at a total cost of 140, big whup! I have read reviews on Hondas and Toyotas and people complain about them. Make sure you know a local repair shop that works on these and the bills will only be slightly higher than the bland accord Camry domestic cars. This is a car that you smile in as you drive. If you are looking for a grocery car then buy something else b/c this is meant for a driving enthusiast not Gramma. Drink holders stink,  who cares ur driving not eating. Was a very nice car. Amazing in the Wisconsin Winters. I call it a tank for the reason that it has been hit 4 times, and the only visible damage to the car was a slight tear in the right rear fender the day it was knocked out of a parking stall and into the stall next to it. However, the repairs make this car not so much fun. I have done regular maintenance on it since I bought the car, and yet I always drive home with it wondering what is going to go wrong with it next. The high dollar fixes become a drain, especially in this economy. Have to get a new PCV valve, and the part costs forty dollars. Repairs total 350-400. Love my car! I love this car. Most people don\\'t believe it\\'s a 98. Looks great drives great and would buy another one. The only thing I\\'ve done is replace the rack and pinion. Still happy! Must have bought a lemon I bought this car used in 2007. It was a 1-owner vehicle with 65,000 miles. 2 weeks after I drove it off the dealership, it broke down. Thank goodness I decided to buy the extended warranty because it was $1500 to fix all that went wrong. In the year and a half I owned this car, it was nothing but problems. I would be anticipating it to break down every 2 months. Fuel line froze 4 times with Heet in the gas tank, tie rods needed replaced, ABS went out, radio needed a code that nobody could find. Would not buy an Audi unless I was making big bucks. Expect to pay a lot for maintenance. Gentlemen, Open Your Wallets I purchased this vehicle new and loaded with all options including the 2.8 V6 because I was seduced by timeless looks and the AWD feature. I took loving care of the car, returning to the dealer for all scheduled service intervals and driving the car gently. Once the warranty expired, I was rewarded with a series of \"routine\" repairs, many well in excess of $1000, including the infamous timing belt/water pump/main seal change at 65K miles, followed shortly by new tie rods/ball joints at 75K. I had intended to keep this car for at least 150K miles, but chose not to do so by enriching the dealer (and later, competent but equally costly independent shop). Will never purchase another Audi/VW. Terrific reliable car, but costly 100,000 miles later, it has never let me down, but be prepared to pay. Suspension bits especially, and there are an infinite number of bits in the quattro suspension. The interior is unmatched and extremely durable, and Audi paint is excellent. There are few cars of the era that do so many things well, including 27mpg.  Great car  I really like this car. When buying the car I thought I would be fun and safe ride and went for it despite its low ground clearance, I was worried  about winter driving. I live in northern Vermont where winters are long, snowy and icy. It turned out to be the best winter car I have ever driven. When it got really bad out we would leave the all wheel drive truck with studded snow tires at home and use the Audi.  I did put a set of good studded snow tires on it but what made it stick to the road was the great suspension and quattro system, by adjusting the throttle you could decide if you wanted to over steer or under steer Lovin it so far I just bought my A4 last October with very close to 100k miles on it, but I know the previous owner and know that it was well cared for. So far, I\\'m loving it! Except for the recent trip to my mechanic, where I found out that my tie rod had a slight problem, as well as my wheel bearings, so that was a bit to get fixed. When I bought it, the track for the moonroof was broken; it still can pop up, it just won\\'t open completely, so I\\'m in no big hurry to fix it. Other than small things like that, I\\'m loving it! My Audi I love the quattro, it makes you stick to the road like no other.  The five speed manual tranny shifts smooth.  The clutches on these cars are weird, it\\'ll have lots of life left but still grab late. Love Hate Typical Euro Loved the car. Quattro, V6, manual - everything I wanted in an automobile. Unfortunately, I owned a Honda and a Toyota before my A4. Audi is totally performance oriented and cares nothing about vehicle life after the 50k warranty. The following were replaced from 70k to 110k: tie rods, suspension components, electronic controls, wheel bearings, and ABS sensor. There was a lifter tick for the last 10k miles so I\\'m sure something else was about to fail. Timing belt change job cost $1400 at 90k. I kept great care of this car and it kept breaking. I don\\'t care how great Quattro was I\\'ll never go back to Audi/VW. A great ride The Audi A4 has been the best car that I have ever owned.  It is the perfect balance between performance and economy.  I regularly get 30 mpg, but it certainly doesn\\'t drive like an economy car.  The turbo gives it power at high altitude that you just can\\'t get with a normally aspirated 4 cylinder engine.  Quattro all-wheel drive keeps it on the road in all weather conditions.  It has provided  165,000 miles of trouble free driving with only routine maintenance.  I haven\\'t abused it, but I don\\'t baby it either.  Never a dull moment.   Don\\'t Do It I loved driving this car. After a while, things started going wrong. Swing arms, tie rods, wheel bearings, speed sensors... this car cost me thousands over 4 years - just to keep it on the road!! Quattro is amazing and this car is extremely fun to drive. Beware, though, because it will cost you a fortune in the long run. I will never buy Audi (or European for that matter) again. Audi has destroyed my faith in \"German engineering\" - or lack thereof. Don\\'t do it I bought my baby (silver A4 quattro) 4 years ago with 70k mi on her. Put 40k on her in those 4 years and have one thing to say: she was the best car in the world, but she was extremely unreliable and expensive to maintain. Tie rods, control arms, electrical modules, wheel bearings, engine seals, ABS module, air bag sensor. You name it, it broke, all of them broke, and she was in the shop for weeks at a time. It cost a fortune to get her out of the shop every time. I babied this car and got nothing in return. Sure, she handled on rails and had a great performance V6, but there is no way I\\'d ever consider giving Audi another shot. Too expensive and unreliable. Wonderful, but be good with a wrench I bought mine used three years ago. I have had many cars but this one was great, terrific pick up, quattro snow traction, excellent ride over all surfaces.  I say \"was\" because it was destroyed in rear-end accident last week.  This is not a car you want brought to the dealer w/no warranty! Ever. You must plan on repairing items yourself or finding a local guy.  If you can do that, the car is affordable, if not, don\\'t buy it or buy a newer one.  Mine has been somewhat reliable, but the engine is particularly trouble prone. I have personally done the following: replaced all camshaft seals (tricky), timing belt, front main seals, wheel bearings, oil pan. Fun to drive, always gets me home! I bought this A4 new in \\'98 and the weak points I\\'ve found are wheel bearings and the lower door trim moldings. The engine is as sweet as the day I bought it! Driving with Q is the only way I\\'ll drive from now on, it never fails me. I treat my cars well and find they in turn treat me well. I have replaced two wheel bearings in the 165,000 miles I\\'ve driven, did them myself. One wheel has been replaced but that was my fault and I just replaced my 3rd door trim molding, seems Audi got cheap making these. All in all I\\'d give this car a solid \"9\". It drives in ANY weather and has better traction no matter what the conditions. I\\'m just about to order a 2007 A4 if that tells you anything. Civilized Driver\\'s Car Perfect balance between comfort and sport. Whether you are just running errands or just out for a relaxing enthusiastic drive, it\\'s a pleasure to drive. Everything is right where you want it in the interior. Great sounding stereo and Quattro handles awesome on wet/snowy roads. Plus, when you get into your 1998 Audi next to someone getting into a 2001 Honda(and you paid less than them), you can\\'t but think \"sucker\" Great Car!!! Great car! I don\\'t know why every one says it is not reliable, mine has 137k and runs like brand new! Of course it will have some minor things to fix since it is almost 10 years old but this happens to every car you buy. For the low price you can get one these days, nothing is better! The handling is exceptional (could be improved with larger sway bars), the engine is very good but needs a little more power easily achieved by replacing the ecu (up to 200hp) and a better cat and intake system. The bose stereo is better than the mark levinson on my friend\\'s lexus. The car is soo much fun to drive it will always put a smile on your face especially on a curvy road. BUY ONE!! A Delight to Drive I have had this car for almost a year now and it is a delight to drive.  The AWD is great along with the tiptronic transmission.  The car had low miles when I bought it and was well maintained, but still had to have the timing belt replaced @ 60,000 miles. Good car Fun, quick, good handling, good on gas,and quiet comfortable ride. Qauttro all the way I have owned my A4 for 3 years and yes I have replaced a lot of parts, but with some research and a little know how, repair costs are 1/4 of what dealers charge. It handles great, has nice interior and looks great. I will never buy anything but an Audi again period! Always in the shop I have had my Audi A4 for about 6 years. I bought it used in 2000. The car is not bad, but it always has something wrong with it. I have had the Air Bag light come on about 3 times. The Check Engine light comes on a lot, too. The Turbo burned up once. The car has had many problems with the electrical system. I just can\\'t afford to drive the car, since things are always going wrong with it. A great car, when it works First of all I would like to say that overall, I\\'ve had pretty good luck with this car considering all of the problems items I\\'ve read about in other reviews. It has great interior and exterior styling, rides nice, and coupled with good tires, the AWD is awesome for the New England winters.  But If you are going to purchase an earlier year Audi, 3 conditions must be met.  1- make sure you are under some kind of warranty 2- If not, make sure you are handy with a wrench (many of the problem items can be fixed yourself). 3- if you can\\'t fix it yourself, find a good mechanic as the dealer repair costs are horrible. Fun but Unreliable I bought my A4 with 58,000 miles on it in Jan 2001 and as of Jan 2006 have 137,000 miles on it.  The car handles very well and the low end power is very good.  My car is completely stock (No mods) and has still been the least reliable car I have ever owned.  Here is a partial list, waterpump(2), power steering rack, spark plug coils, numerous front suspension arms and tie rods, wheel bearings, various leaks (Diff fluid, power steering fluid, coolant, oil), various electrical problems/switches.  It was been a fun and expensive 5 years of ownership, but when it comes time to buy again, I will probably not buy another Audi. NOT RELIABLE Very fun to drive, awesome in snow. However, **extremely** unreliable. Guaranteed to fail (all happened to me): -ABS Module (min $2000 to replace, for cheaper alternative checkout autoecu.com) -oil leaks (at least $1500 to replace $8 part, do timing belt at the same, same labor involved) -tie rods -Control arms (there\\'s a recall on one of them, but ALL of them will eventually fail) -rear deck speakers (easy fix, just glue the poly-cone, it comes loose causing vibration) -side mirror reflective material deterioriating (i\\'ve seen it on other A4\\'s in parking lots) -side door base-molding rots/falls of Great Car! When I bought this car, I lived in the Minneapolis area and had the strong need for All Wheel drive without the need for a pick-up truck, AWD van or SUV.  The A4 has been fun and basically reliable.  I had one front headlight lamp and both front upper control arms replaced under warranty.  Out of warranty I\\'ve had to have the ambient temperature and coolant sensors and brake master cylinder replaced. Some Good Things, Some Bad Things It is expensive to fix, unless you are a DIY or can find a good mechanic who knows these cars. Do not bring back to the dealer, esp. if it\\'s used. Some issues with control arm and tie rods, but I put lots of miles on it. The digital readouts sometimes do not work well, esp. if there is significant climate change (I live in New England where it can change by 30 degrees in a day.)  A/C is crisp and good, Engine is sound, body is excellent and resists salt erosion and wear, mechanically there are some issues esp over pothole roads. It is fast and nimble car, no back seat leg room. Audi I purchased my Audi A4 2.8 Quattro new after studying reports on AWD and 4 wheel drive vehicles on the Internet and in libraries, I narrowed the field to 5 potential cars.  I then test drove all of them, most more than once, on surface streets, highway and the Colorado mountain highways to check cornering and ability to keep up with the pack (you know what I mean if you\\'ve ever driven I-70). The Audi A4 stood out far above all the others!  8 years later, I am still a huge fan! All scheduled maintenance has been performed, but no major repairs have been necessary.  The car still handles and performs like a dream, and looks as good and stylish as any new auto.  I love driving this car!   The ultimate love hate relationship I love to drive this car. The interior is the best in class. I added a GIAC chip which gave a little more throttle response and that was all the power I needed. The 2.8 is very smooth, the handling is great and it\\'s a georgous car. On the other hand there have been some reliablity issues. I\\'ve replaced: eng fan, control arm, tie rods, defective CD chg, vac line (recall), cam seals, T-stat, and now the ABS controller is dying. Other probs were from fine tuning modifications that I added. I do most of my own maint and shop for aftermarket parts online and junkyards for deals on parts. So it hasn\\'t been that bad financially. But I wouldn\\'t recommend to a non-DIY type.  Still Holding Up I\\'ve had this car for three years and it\\'s held up fairly well.  My only problems so far have been a broken switch for the right rear window, faulty door seals in the left rear that allowed water to leak in when it rained hard, and the headlight sprayer hose caused a leak to the washer fluid reservoir.  Other than that this car has been fantastic.  It handles well, still gets compliments on it\\'s looks, and the FWD version (which is a few hundred lbs lighter than Quattro) is fast enough to pass anyone I want, even in 5th gear on the highway.  I\\'ve got 93000 miles now and I plan to drive this car into the ground:) Quality Problems I absolutly love my 1998 Audi A4 1.8T quattro Sedan, but I cannot believe how often I am in the service departmant at the Audi dealership.  I have had to replace countless airbags, clutches, and electronic compontes.  I have had to replace cracked CV boots and joints.  The CD player has malfunctioned several times.  I am really dissapointed at the reliability of this car. I have had to have it towed to the dealership at least three times with in the last four years.  I am not impressed and will never buy an Audi again despite how much I love it, my wallet does not.   good but not great the 1998 Audi A4 is a great driver\\'s car and has nice styling, but its not really a performance car compared to my BMW. The AWD system is awesome, the car handles well, rides smoothly, and has tons of cool features for the money. My mileage was a little less than I expected, 23 MPG highway / 19 MPG, city but not horrible. I have had issues that the (GM) dealer took care of when I purchased the car (oil leaks, control arms, and tie rods). Do not take your car to the dealer for repairs. Get a good mechanic that knows these cars. Audi A4 - 1998 I have had nothing but problems with my 1998 Audi A4.  It has had electrical problems in the dash.  The tie rods all had to be replaced (they have since been recalled).  At 70,000 miles the turbo unit had to be replaced ($1500.00)  The CV joints have leaked several times.  The exhaust fell off the bottom of the car.  The timing belt broke and damaged the entire engine.  The cost to rebuild it was $2000.00.  The ABS light is now on, I just took it to the shop to find out that the entire module is bad and the estimate to fix it is $2420.00.  I just picked it up from having the motor rebuilt three weeks ago.  I would not recommend that anybody buy this model car.  It handles great and is fun to drive(when it runs). Beware best car in its class My 1998 Audi A4 2.8 Sedan runs smooth, is fast, and luxiouros. It held up really well for seven years. The AWD option is a beautiful thing to have. There\\'s nothing like the 2.8 engine. This car looked the same until 2001. 1.8T Quattro Bought this as a \"certified\" used vehicle 3 years ago - a 5-speed Quattro with already-installed performance chip (recommended!).  Performance and handling are great.  Had a few issues after purchase but all were taken care of under warranty.  Back seat is small for three - you won\\'t haul the family comfortably over a long distance, but as a daily commuter car it\\'s great.   Buyer beware Terrific car for foul weather, when it\\'s not in the shop.  Fun to drive, if you can afford premium fuel and poor mileage (19 mpg average).  Beautiful car, however, it will break the bank when it breaks down! Owned it for seven years and counting We bought our 1998 Audi A4 2.8 new and have really \\renjoyed it.  Despite the four doors \\rand rear seats, the car is really made \\rfor two adults.  Our reliability has been \\rvery good, though the car is \\rmaintenance intensive with brakes and \\rsuspension parts.  The multi-link \\rsuspension works great on the road, \\rbut at about 60,000 the arms start to \\rrattle and require replacement.  The \\rcar has had its share of electrical \\rglitches, but nearly all of these \\rappeared and were corrected while \\rstill under Audi\\'s excellent warranty \\rprogram.  The quattro makes the car \\rone of the best choice for Maine. Will \\rtrade in the next year or so for \\ranother A4 or maybe trade up to an A6. Bought it at 50,000 miles and lovin it! I purchased a 1998 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro Sedan with 50,000\\rmiles on it.  Everything still works great.  This car has a \\rsmooth ride.  The turbo could be stronger though.  Other\\rthan that im lovin it!  Reliability seems like hit and miss... Did alot of research for this car. I\\rbought it with 40K on the odo. So far, I\\rhave 75K and still going strong. Soon as\\rI bought the car, I chipped it and threw\\rin K&N filter.  Boosted the output\\rconsiderably (Need it b/c I have\\rtiptronic, Porsche version).  Definately\\ra must if you own this car.  About to\\rput in exhaust (surface rusted) and NOS\\rsprayer for intercooler.  Handles very\\rwell but not too harsh.  I do lot of\\rhi-way traveling.  Pretty quite for car\\rof this size and sportiness.  I love the\\rAWD on this. Drove to ski resort and\\rsurprise to find that I can drive 35+mph\\ron them slippery stuff. The ski boot was\\ranother neat feature.  Didn\\'t know I had\\rit!  Gotta like the heated seats;^) Unsung Hero Bought used 1.5yrs ago with lowish \\rmileage. Been a good car with only one \\rfailure that warranty covered. Love the \\rergonomics, build quality, high quality \\rmaterials throughout and advanced \\rengine and drivetain design (AWD).\\rCar is a great do everything vehicle, \\rwith reasonable performance (0-60 in \\r7.1 seconds) i love my car There\\'s nothing I can say that someone \\ralready hasn\\'t covered.  Quattro is \\runbelievable in rain, gravel, snow, \\rand grass (hehe).  The acceleration is \\rgood, but not stellar.  The gas \\rmileage hurts a bit too much for the \\rQuattro though, seeing as how I \\raverage 21 mpg on 93 octane.  For a \\rcompact car I\\'d expect a little \\rbetter.  All in all, if you can afford \\rthe gas and want to stick to the road \\r(or whatever surface you\\'re driving \\ron), get the A4Q.  The suspension is \\rdefinitely a problem.  You\\'ll just \\rhave to get it fixed.  It feels good \\rin the city, even better on the \\rfreeway, super firm yet comfy \\renough for long trips.  I love my car. disappointed Bought this car new. Loved the looks \\rand how it performed in the snow.  \\rHowever, I spent way too much time at \\rthe dealer. Replaced 3 airbags, \\rstarter, wheel bearings,tie rods and \\rhad repeated \"check engine\" problems.  \\rAll the exterior molding fell off and \\rinterior was poor quality. Brake handle \\rbroke,as well as other interior parts.  \\rSpent $31000 for the car and it was not \\rclose to being worth it.  Did not hold \\rit\\'s value and was not impressed with \\rAudi customer service. Bought a new \\rSubaru Legacy and love it.  Own two A4\\'s I have two of these cars - a 98 Turbo \\rFWD and a 99 Turbo Quattro.  Most of \\rthe people on this site who have rated \\rthese cars are idiots - comparing \\rapples to oranges.  Yes, if you have \\rQuattro it is goin to be sluggish in \\rfirst and second.  AWD robs power, you \\rfools.  Don\\'t compare it to a FWD \\rJapanese car.  Yes, your car is going \\rto need new tires and timing belt at \\r60,000 miles.  Stuff wears out, suck it \\rup.  No, it is not more expensive to \\rfix than a Japanese car - I have found \\rit to be cheaper. Well worth the money - and repairs. I have had my share of problems with \\rthe car. Broken turbo, tie rod ends, \\rcontrol arms, wheel bearings, and the \\rignition switch. But with all the \\rbroken things, I just replace them \\rwith aftermarker parts, which \\rmake my car so much more enjoyable to \\rdrive. I have upgraded the turbo from \\ra k03 to a k04, put in heavy duty \\rcontrol arms and tie rod \\rends, put a full race coilover kit \\r(KW), made a custom 3\" Turbo-back \\rexhaust with hi flow cat, and did many \\rother little things, that would cost \\rmore to replace with OEM parts than \\rwhat I did, yet I yeild much happier \\rresults. This is a drivers car. \\rQuattro is AMAZING in snow/incliment \\rweather. Nice Ride. Firm suspension.  Great 4 wheel  Audi VS Detroit Past owner of Corvettes and just traded \\rin a 1994 Z-28 that I loved with \\r140,000 miles on it. This Audi handles \\rcorners like it is on rails. The power \\ris less than my Z-28 but very usable \\rwith the 5 speed automatic slap shift \\roption. Loves the highway. Great car ! Great fun w/some drawbacks I love driving this car - whether it\\'s \\rjust to the store or on a 300 mile \\rvacation.  This is my first AWD and I \\rnow swear by it for the best traction \\rand overall feeling of safety.  \\rHowever the problems with the engine \\rand catalytic convertor, combined with \\rthe cost of maintenance, sour the \\rexperience.  After three years of \\rownership, I\\'ve replaced the cat three \\rtimes.  The engine work is another \\rnightmare altogether - suffice to say \\rit cost me nearly $5k. I still love \\rthe car in spite of all that.  Audi 2.8 Quattro I love the car, but fixing even little \\rthings can be very expensive!  THE CARS THAT SPOIL YOU I have put 18000 miles on my beautiful \\rred/black leather \\rinterior/5speed/Quattro in the past 18 \\rmonths and I love it. The only \\rdisappointemnt was the Bose speaker in \\rthe rear blew and Audi would not repair \\rit. I think Bose should have replaced \\rit, but Audi covers it only to 50,000 \\rmiles, which I think being a Bose,one \\rof the best they should cover it. \\rBesides that it is so nice looking and \\rhandles like a dream. In the rain 65 on \\raramp is nothing. It is wonderful. I\\'ve \\rhad 45 cars so far in my life. My 2nd \\rAudi and I just love them.Can\\'t be beat! Love my Car My first Audi. Reliable, comfortable,safe and \\rsomehow . . . lovable.  My satisfaction with \\rmy A4 helped persuade at least 4 other \\rfriends to purchase their A4s, A6s and TTs. \\rI\\'ll never be able to go back to 2WD after \\rdriving Quattro! Goes in the snow I bought this Audi AWD to get me home to Never Again!! I was in love with my Audi for the \\rfirst four years.  Now, in the past 18 \\rmonths I have spent $7000 repairing \\rit.  First the water pump was leaking, \\rthen the heat exchanger went, now the \\rcar is in the shop gettin the \\rtensioners replaced which is a $2200 \\rjob.  Once this problem is fixed, I am \\rselling the car and going back to \\rJapanese cars - I can\\'t afford this \\rGerman engineering any longer!!  The \\rstyling on this car is terrific, but \\rit\\'s not worth the cost!   MUST HAVE $$$ TO BLOW Can\\'t possibly fit all of my \\rexperiences in this small review.  \\rPurchased used w/ 50k miles, audi \\rassured, well maintained by Audi by the \\rbook.  Secretly phoned dealer where car \\rwas originally serviced and found it \\rhad many issues not disclosed to me \\rprior to purchase.  Numerous issues, \\rsome major and other minor.  Audi servi \\rce is bad (5 different dealers in 3 \\rdifferent states). Fun Car, but Nightmare Reliability I bought a 1.8T Q 5spd new in 1/98 and have \\rreligiously maintained it for the past 6 years.  \\rCar is in the shop so often that it\\'s \\rhumorous.  Turbo had to be replaced at 2k \\rmiles; all sorts of electrical problems; cracked \\rbrake reservoir; leaking oil from gasket; I \\rcould go on...\\rI will never buy an Audi again.  The quality is \\rhorrendous for a car marketed as an upscale, \\rperformance sedan.  I\\'m in the market for a \\rHonda or Acura.  Take it from a reasonable, \\rlevel-headed person--do not buy an Audi. Overengineered, but fun I\\'ve put all 102,000 mi on my Audi \\rsince 7/1997. The first 4-5 years were \\rgreat. The car is wonderful to drive, \\rand I still love to drive it. However, \\rit\\'s cost me about $2k-3k/yr over the \\rlast 2.5yrs to keep it running. \\rI\\'ve maintained it as \\rmeticulously as possible. My \\rind mech (got tired of the \\rdealership) stocks the fr susp \\rcomponents because so many fail (about \\rone set a week he says). In addtn, \\rI\\'ve had to replace brakes, radiator, \\rstarter motor, rear wheel bearings \\r(twice!), and the timing belt (I guess \\rthis last one is expected).   Don\\'t buy it Fun to drive, handles snow very well.  \\rRepairs frequent and very expensive.  \\rHave had to replace two headlights, \\rhead gasket, and timing belt at 74,000 \\rmiles.  $4000 so far.  Rub rails \\rfalling off the car, (defective \\rbrackets), transmission shifts rough.  \\rAudi\\'s QA doesn\\'t measure up to selling \\rprice.  I will never buy Audi again My car is junk I bought the car with 39k last October, \\rsince then I have replaced all front \\rcontrol arms, brakes all around, now it \\ris the shop apparently needs a new rear \\rdifferential and possible wheel \\rbearings. The front of the car keeps \\rfalling off, when I park too close to a \\rcurb. Cup holders don\\'t work, my 850 \\rvolvo gets better gas mileage. Love the \\rlooks, hate the car. Local dealer sucks. Beware of Beautiful Cars I bought my A4 new and have maintained \\rit meticulously from the day I bought \\rit.  I would not buy one again.  It \\rstarted falling apart after 4 years:  \\ralternator, battery, engine control \\rmodule, tie rod ends (twice), upper and \\rlower control arm links, drivers side \\rairbag, sunroof control switch, rear \\rshocks, engine mount.  All of this cost \\rabout $5,000.  Luckily, I bought an \\rextended warranty that defrays some of \\rthe cost.  If you plan to buy one of \\rthese cars and keep it after the \\rwarranty expires, be prepared to spend \\ra lot on repairs.  And those repairs \\rwill cost you at least twice as much as \\ryou would expect. Love with reservations This is a great car - fun to drive, \\rsuper traction and cornering, very good \\rcurb appeal.  I love the styling - I \\rjust can\\'t get into the newer A4\\'s and \\rA6\\'s.   Probably won\\'t buy another one...  For about 2 years, it was by far the \\rBEST used car I ever owned...  Then I \\rhit 60,000 miles... Since then the car \\rwas in the shop every other week.  My \\rbrakes gave out, tie rods were shot, 4 \\rtires had to be replaced, ignition coil \\rreplaced, headlights replaced twice, \\rspeaker blew, cd player stopped \\rworking, fuel pump went out, trunk \\rstopped opening, alternator kicked it, \\rand the AC compressor died.  Finally, I \\rdecided to give up and sell it, and \\rliterally the day before, the timing \\rbelt broke.  It has now been at the \\rdealer for 2 months, as of yesterday.  \\rAll told, approx. $8800 for repairs \\rsince 60,000 miles (and I never did get \\rthe AC fixed).  Bah. THE CAR TO HAVE.. I LOVE MY AUDI I HAVE OWNED MY AUDI  My A4Q experience   Overall it has been a very pleasant\\rexperience, except for dealing with the\\rdealerships.  Very difficult to tell if\\ryou will receive good or poor experience\\rand it varies between dealerships as\\rwell.  The car itself has been fine in\\rthe snow, and the gas mileage isn\\'t bad\\rfor a 4wd car.  Great looks and\\rcomfortable interior.  Wish it had more\\rpower though... Excellent Car I love my A4.  Got it for $11,000 a \\ryear ago.  Just throw a APR chip in it \\rand it\\'s a blast to drive.  Now it\\'s \\rgot 200 Hp / 240 lb feet of torque & \\rstill gets 30 MPG.  Excellent used car \\rto buy.  Be sure to do the timing belt \\rbefore 75K & let the car run for a \\rminute or two to cool the turbo before \\rturning it off.  These cars hold up \\rgreat, still nice and tight with 80K on \\rthe odometer.  Just change the oil, \\rspend a little extra for mobil 1.     Audi A4 1.8L quattro We live in snow country with 200 average Fun to drive, expensive to repair  I loved the road handling and the way \\r80 mph felt like 35 mph. -Quattro will \\rtake off some low end grunt from a \\rstand still. The styling is very slick \\rand the interior very comfortable. \\rHowever, I found the car to require \\rfrequent, expensive service.   Audi A4 needs a lot of repairs This car is really fun to drive but \\rhas needed a LOT of repairs.  In a \\rlittle over 2 years it has needed 6500 \\rworth of repairs.  I spoke to the \\rextended warranty company (thank \\rgoodness I bought that) and he said \\rthey are losing their shirt on Audis.\\rIt is still a blast to drive, but \\rbeware of repairs. My 1998 A4Q I own this car for 5 years now. It has \\rthe sports package, Bose Audio and 6 \\rCD changer. INterior is leather. The \\rleather held up very well, the only \\rscratches are from my daughter \\rthrowing a tantrum in the rear seat \\rwith her sandals, using the buckles. \\rThe only thing that bothers me is a \\rlight rattle when cold over my \\rshoulder. Poblems fixed by a repair: \\rsome control arm broke down after 5 \\ryears and the transmission was \\rleaking. Otherwise I\\'ve been lucky. \\rThe car rides comfortably, the engine \\r(30V) is very silky smooth but \\rpowerful. It does use some oil (1/2 l \\revery month or so). The quattro AWD \\rwas useful for skiing vacation. I \\rnever slipped anywhere.  Pain in the you know what Bought it in 03. The thing is  Stay Away! Bought this car in \\'98, thought I was \\rbuying the ultimate car.  All the \\rseals leaked, problems with exhaust.  \\rTie rods went, radiator developed a \\rleak, as well as water pump. Wheel \\rbearings went in two wheels, all with \\rless than 50 K miles in 5 years!  \\rNoise in rear of car that two car \\rdealers could not find, then told that \\rrear suspension needed replacing.  \\rTraded in for a Honda, very happy now, \\rbut experience with Audi, who did not \\rcompensate me for my expenses and \\ragony, was miserable. Audi is a four \\rletter word to me now.  Don\\'t buy an \\rAudi. Fun to drive but terrible quality Bought this brand new, and have had a \\rsuccession of minor and major problems. \\rWhile the driving experience is \\rexcellent, the build quality of the car \\ris terrible--worse than a 1984 Ford \\rEscort I used to own. It\\'s bad enough \\rthat I never plan on buying another \\rAudi. I\\'d advise you not to buy one to \\rbegin with. 5 Years and Still Loving it After a few frustrating episodes with the \\rdealer on service issues, I still love this car.  \\rI\\'ve got 65k miles and it looks and rides like \\rbrand new!  Just took a 1,000 mile trip and \\raveraged 30mpg while averaging 75mph! Buy Japenese I purchased this vehicle used two years \\rago. Have driven approx. 15,000 miles. \\rHere are the problems to date: tie rods \\ragain-all seals leaking-airbag sensor-\\rcracked oil line to turbo-squeaky \\rdrivers seat-warped rotors-replaced \\rvalve cover gaskets-timing belt \\rtensioner-cruise control switch-engine \\rcontrol module. Never Again I will never by another Audi.  This \\rvehicle has had several major \\rmechanical issues, and the manufacturer \\rhas refused to cover them since it is \\rout of warranty.  A vehicle in this \\rclass with relatively low mileage \\rshould not have these issues (and our \\rInfiniti doesn\\'t).  It is the most \\runreliable vehicle I\\'ve ever \\rpurchased.  I know several other owners \\rwho had similar experiences. not worth it Bought this car 2 months before \\rwarranty run out.  Since then, it has \\rbeen a year and half and I\\'ve just \\rtotaled my repair bills.  $6400!  Water \\rtank, timing belt, sun roof, gaskit, \\ralarm, brakes, you name it.  I wonder \\ris it just this car or this model.   A4=Headaches I\\'ve had this car for only a year and a \\rhalf and have had numerous problems and \\rannoyances: a continous squeeky driver \\rseat, numerous \"check engine\" lights \\rand to top it all off the engine \\rseized. Luckily, the Audi Assured \\rwarranty covered the engine, but Audi \\rrefused to provide me a loaner car for \\rthe three weeks it sat at the \\rdealership. To me, that is inexcusable.\\r  Beware of A4 I bought this car used with 35k in \\r09/01 and it has been a big \\rdisappointment. Two weeks after I drove \\rit off the lot it needed a new front \\rbearing. Since then I\\'ve had to bring \\rthe car in to the dealer for numerous\\rproblems (The Check Engine light seems \\rto appear every 6 months). Most of the \\rproblems were minor and were covered \\runder the Audi Assured warranty but the \\rreal kicker is my engine died. The car \\rwas in the shop for three weeks. Audi \\rdid replace the engine and turbo at \\rtheir cost, but during the three weeks \\rthe car was in the shop they refused to \\rprovide a loaner 1998 Audi A4 2.8L Quattro Difficult to beat for the price. I felt \\rthat way four years ago when I \\rpurchased it, and I feel that way now.  Fun Car to drive    I just bought my 98 Turbo and just \\rabout everything is fine except for \\rthe smell of buring oil.  I checked \\rthe oil and I guess the last owner \\rdidn\\'t like to change it because it \\rwas pitch black.  So I\\'ve changed it, \\rit wasn\\'t very easy, and hopefully \\rthat gets rid of the oil smell.  Other \\rthan that, the car looks great and is \\ra blast to drive.  If the oil smell \\rgoes away, I will love this car.  Audi Is German for Crap suspension replaced $1700, dealer \\rthought the head gasket could be sealed \\rbut coolant still leaking.  Was told \\rthat it is now a cracked block.  I \\ralready paid $1500 for the head gasket \\rnow I have to cough up $3000 for the \\rblock.  I was going to sell the car and \\rnow all I can get is trade-in value. Do \\rnot buy this car. A4 Quattro with performance chip I purchased a used A4 Quattro in \\rearly \\'02, and it\\'s been wonderful.  \\rIt\\'s a blast to drive - handling is \\rexceptional, and an upgraded \\rperformance chip (boosts HP to 190) \\rmated with a 5 speed provides great \\racceleration from a standing start as \\rwell as while going down the highway.  \\rThe car isn\\'t necessarily the biggest \\rhead-turner, but the styling is clean \\rand the fit and finish are great.  I \\rget about 25 MPG commuting, and 30 MPG \\ron longer trips.  I\\'ve only had one \\rminor problem (power window got stuck) \\rwhich was covered under warranty \\rwithout a problem. Don\\'t be fooled by the pretty car Control arm bushings failed, the \\rwindshield wipers failed, the ignition \\rwiring failed.  I go through a $100 \\rheadlight a year.  I\\'ve had to replace \\rtwo fuel injectors.  After having a \\rrecall service performed on the front \\rtie-rods, the car never drove straight \\ragain.  It requires $91 octane gasoline \\ror better (US).  This car was \\rmaintained by Audi, by the book, for \\rthe first 50,000 miles, and \\rmeticulously by myself and a certified \\rAudi technician thereafter, yet it \\rcontinues to fall apart.  I truly wish \\rI never bought this car and I wouldn\\'t \\rown another Audi if someone paid me to \\rdo so.  It\\'s the definition of an \\runreliable lemon. Make Sure You Have a Replacment Car Least reliable car I have ever owned. \\rMost expensive to repair car I have \\rever owned.  Broken timing belt cost me \\rover 6K to repair and it was 3 months \\rat the dealer before I saw it again.\\r Headlight switch goes out twice a \\ryear...every year.\\r Front end is too low to the ground, \\rgets pulled off by parking blocks.\\r Bad weld on engine needed repair.\\r Water pump, fan clutch, electric fan, \\rball joints, window washer pump, among \\rrepairs I can recall.\\r   my review this has been a great upgrade in car  Great Car Nothing to change Just have to say that this car was the  Expensive to Fix:  But to be expected I bought my A4 used: My first used car \\rin many years.  I love the car, but it \\rcertainly can be pricey in repair \\rbills.  In the last several months I \\rhave replaced 2 ball barrings and a \\rleaking seal - spilling oil into both \\rthe upper and lower pans (in total \\rcosting almost 2 grand.)  Now, I need \\rnew brakes (something the Audi dealer \\rinstisted I didn\\'t need) and I recently \\rstarted having a problem with the \\remmisions.  It certainly isn\\'t my last \\rcar (Accord EX), which I bought new, \\rput 60,000 miles on, and never replaced \\ra thing on(except wipers and tires.)  \\rBUT, I STILL LOVE MY AUDI. It\\'s \\rperformace and handling outweigh the \\rmechanical hassels (so far...) So far so good I just got back from paying a $700 bill \\rfor a new throttle body at 67,000 \\rmiles.  Other than brakes (at no cost \\rbecause of Audi\\'s free 3 year \\rmaintenance), tires and front shocks, \\rthis car has been trouble-free.  I\\'ve \\rread a few reliability horror stories \\rwhich concern me, but I haven\\'t \\rexperieiced it yet.  The car is 5 years \\rold and it still feels like a new car.  \\rPerformance of the 1.8T engine is so \\rterrific (I have a 5sp manual) that I \\rwouldn\\'t take a bigger engine if you \\rgave it to me. Please help me sell my lemon Here I sit car-less again.  My Audi A4 \\ris in the shop.  Last month it was the \\rclutch.  My car has only 60,000 miles!  \\rAnd yes, this is the FIRST time I have \\rever had to replace a clutch and it\\'s \\rmy fourth manual trans car.  My \\rcomputer has to be reset continuously.  \\rI have replaced  my CD changer twice.  \\rAnd why is it they make you trade in \\rthe old one but STILL charge over $200 \\rfor the new one??? Also, why was Brake \\rCheck able to locate the oil leak in \\rone visit when the dealer wasn\\'t able \\rto locate it in MULTIPLE visits?  I \\rwanted to wait a year before buying a \\rnew car, but I have recently determined \\rthat I can\\'t afford to spend another \\rdime on this lemon! The Grover Dill of muscle cars The title is due to its small size and excellent performance. In fact, this car accelerates better than most of the highly vaunted muscle cars of the 1960s, while providing outstanding mileage and comfort. Contrary to what the Edmunds review states, my car has a seven speed DCT. I ended up getting the Prestige trim level, since my dealer did not have a Premium Plus car. I am very pleased with the performance of my car, but I wish that it had fewer electronic doodads. The Virtual Cockpit offers nothing useful to make it superior to the analog display that my A3 had, and it can be confusing at times. I do like the magnetic ride option, which gives a smoother, quieter ride than a standard suspension. My wife and I have become very fond of the Audi 3 series cars, due to their compact size and excellent maneuverability. From hot hatch to the Gentleman\\'s Evo I rated the comfort neutral on this car as I\\'m of 6\\'8 stature, however I love smaller cars for their fun factor. That being said I love everything about this car, form the way it drives, the power along with the fit and finish. I came from a heavily modified Focus ST but grew tired of shifting gears during my 100mi round trip commute. The S3 has truly checked all the performance boxes for me as Ive already done a track day in the car and consistently frequent the canyons roads here in Southern California. If you are looking for a complaint sedan that will bring a smile to your face while achieving 30mpg then look no further as this is the car for you. S3NSATIONAL! Previously had the 2015 Audi A3.  This car is in another league, it’s a supercar in a sedan. The performance is powerful, tech package is very well done and interior is best in class. Car can be wide open without compromising comfort.  All wheel fun allows year round excitement with 5 Star safety. Imagine a roadster... with four doors I moved from California, and didn\\'t want to try driving my two seater RWD sports car in New Jersey winters. Test drove pretty much every AWD car between $30K and $60K. (Fewer than you\\'d think.) The S3 is simply an insane amount of fun. Handles better than a Miata, . Virtual cockpit is awesome. I really only have one complaint: the engine auto-stop/auto-start is a big hesitant, and although it\\'s trivial to disable it, you can\\'t change the default setting. Otherwise it\\'s pretty much perfect. I\\'ve done several long runs on rough/choppy pavement, and it handles it well. One of the proximity sensors needed resetting after driving through torrential (post-hurricane) rain; no big deal. From a Jack to a Queen I traded in my 2016 Focus RS for something much more refined and just as much fun to drive!  The AUDI S3 is quiet refined and very very quick when you want it to be. It can be economical as on a trip to Dallas last week, I recorded 30.4mpg driving 75+ on a 200 mile leg of the trip. Fit and finish is excellent. I enjoyed my boy toy Focus RS but now wish  that I had tried or even looked toward the pocket rocket S3. Great Performance Sedan Low head room in back seats. 19 inch wheels and 235 35 tires are harsh sometimes. Nav and Internet via cell connection are redundant with a smart phone; screen mirroring would cost less and work as well or better. This car is very quick and handles very well. Brakes are strong and took getting used to because they are sensitive to the first touch. They modulate well after that. Back seats fold down for cargo. After two track days at Atlanta Motorsports Park, faster than a ctsv Cadillac and Chevy ss on this short, curvy track. Expensive but backs it up with refinement and capability. Goes like a Subaru in the snow with all season Continental dws 06 tires. I love it and hope to keep it a long time. Rocket ship for the city! I traded my 2017 Mustang GT for a 2015 S3 with 34,000 miles, about 2 months ago. Let’s get my dislikes out of the way. 1. Wish it had a 7th gear for cruising on the interstate2. Almost no interior storage3. Only has 1 grocery hook but my 2012 A4 has 24. Back up camera should have been standard or part of the $2,600 nav packageBut ignore those complaints because this car is amazing! Even though it’s barely different from the A3 it’s turns a lot of heads. I cut off the resonator and now it’s just enough noise to have fun with but still daily. The handling is superb from factory. Audi quality speaks for itself. I love the understatedness of this car. I honestly can’t say enough good things about it for $28,000. New at $50k it’s debatable, but if you can find a used one with relatively low miles jump on it! The S3 Is a BEAST! It all starts under the hood. A heavily modified version of the A3\\'s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. With 292 horsepower, an increase of 72 hp over the A3. That power is applied to all four wheels through a standard six-speed automated manual transmission, which, according to Audi, is good enough to fire you off to 60 mph in less than 5 seconds Fantastic out of the box for every day, but... Absolutely gorgeous car. Fantastic out of the box for every day, but if you want to go fast the transmission isn\\'t up to snuff. My 2009 Ralliart could go through the gears up or down, much faster than an S3??? My ralliart was tuned but even so, for a sub 50k luxury sedan the transmission was really the only disappointment. Downshifting takes a bit too long, enough where I sometimes blip 2 gears because I thought I did not hit the paddle hard enough. But really other than that, this is an amazing everyday vehicle. Don\\'t bother racing or autocrossing unless you get a TCU tune. Sedan perfection! This is a fun, practical, fast sporty and good liking vehicle.  Always thrilled to drive it. Totally engaging and the best possible sedan for a driver anywhere near this price range. CLA 45 AMG VS S3 I have actual electronic track times for my S3. 0 to 60 = 4.4 and 1/4 mile@ 12.9. Is this S3 a Bugatti Veyron 16.4 NO, but for the money its a great value. When we launch we all don\\'t all do it exactly the same way. If anything I took it easy when I tested my S3 for the first time, as it only had 100 miles on it. The one thing I didn\\'t notice which some have mentioned  is a bit of turbo lag. None Here.The Mercedes CLA 45 AMG is a great car but its going to cost you 15Gs more to better the S3 times by only  0.3 0 to 60 and 0.3 in the 1/4. Top end on both cars is governed at 155mph. I would like to see them on the track. Awesome car... with one minor flaw I bought a \\'15 Sepang Blue Premium Plus S3 end of June 2015. Seeing as this was my personal \\'to and from the office\\' car, I didn\\'t go crazy with options, opting for just a handful: performance package (primarily for the shocks and sweet looking wheels), the driver comfort package (Homelink being the big one there) and the Driver Assistance package (camera/back-up sensors etc.)First off... the car\\'s a hoot to drive. Setting the exhaust to dynamic makes the most of the engine, and makes it sound considerably sportier. The engine is responsive and the engine doesn\\'t lack for power. I do suspect that my car is an underachiever in terms of horses - I\\'m not getting close to sub-5 second sprints to 60. This could also be because my engine only has 3K on it. The car handles extremely well - feels as well planted as anything I\\'ve ever owned - including my e92 335i coupe.The largest disappointment for me is the gearbox. I find that there\\'s .5 seconds of lag between input and response - this isn\\'t turbo lag per se, this is the gearbox being slow in response to the input. This happens across the rev range. (even in launch control mode) Audi really needs to look at the software and possibly tweak it. I know that other aftermarket parts suppliers have also noticed this and addressed it through add-ons. I also think that Audi should give this thing more than 6 forward speeds. I think that a 7 or 8 speed DSG would further help with performance and also improve highway mileage.Interior-wise, the cabin is stylish. I like the two tone seats in mine. I went for the black/grey leather combination - I find the black/red a little too garish for my taste. On the whole, I like the interior - although, a little more storage space would be welcome. The plastics on certain areas feel a little cheap. Back seat leg space is sufficient for my kids - think adults could be a little cramped over long distances.As a whole, I\\'m very happy with my car - and look forward to driving it. I just hope that they can address the minor items I\\'ve called out above (in particular, the transmission lag) Best of all worlds I picked up this car on 5/30/15. So far, I am amazed literally every time I drive it. Full disclosure: this is my fifth Audi in 30 years, so I am definitely a fan. The S3 is an incredible amalgam of power, speed, comfort, features and appearance. It includes Homelink (garage door opener), manual sport seats (Recaro quality), nav system, and a \"jukebox\" (hard drive) that will hold up to 3,000 songs. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is great, so I rip my .mp3s at their highest resolution. The sales staff even made an after-delivery tutorial session where we set up the car\\'s parameters. Switchable magnetic suspension, multiple drive and shift modes. Shocks Corvette and Mustang drivers! 4wd!!! After 18 mos, this car is still incredlbly fast and agile. Yet it can be driven in \\'granny mode\\' very comfortably. A good radar dedector is helpful, as simple passing maneuver acceleration can put the car at 85-90 with no conscious effort. Takes gentle mountain curves at 110 with ease and a remarkable lack of drama, making a pleasant Sunday drive into take-me-to-jail territory.  Not that I have done this, of course, but I have read glowing accounts on forums and YouTube. How Ended Up with the Audi S3 I did not set out to buy an Audi & I don\\'t care about having a \"prestige brand\"...in fact I\\'d prefer not to have it. However we needed AWD, fast (300ish hp), high quality, cargo space, fun, cool looking, DSG type auto transmission car.  Audi is the only one building that and it\\'s the S3.  Considered S4 but MPG too low; Golf R has too little cargo room but nice car. S3 combines amazing refinement, quiet ride, taut but comfortable euro sedan ride, throaty exhaust when punched, great looks, good MPG, driver assistance that can be shut off, & much more.  The 2015 S3 is dual personality and you decide which one you want: rip roaring sports car or a easy driving luxurious touring sedan.  Amazing.Update 11/2017:   Still love this car and will never sell it.  It draws many compliments and I never seem to see that many S3s running around.  I like this 2015 styling better than the \"update.\"  The update has more \"check mark\" style of headlights which I do not prefer.  I ran the S3 at the track and it was 100ºF that day.  With Nitto NT05 tires it performed well but wasn\\'t scary fast; cornered very well however.  For me though it\\'s not a track car but a perfect street car.  298hp Is adequate (and I\\'d like more).  But the S-Tronic transmission is the win in the S3: it uses the power very efficiently and you\\'ll be able to beat a lot of cars that should be faster (I know b. I\\'ve done it).  Interior is amazing still, very comfortable and upscale showing very little wear with the high class materials.  No reliability problems whatsoever have cropped up although my car is fairly low miles.  MPG is around 25 which is amazing for an AWD sports car with this power.  When the warranty wears out I will put a Stage 2 APR chip in it to easy and safely unlock more power.  Guys who\\'ve bought the RS3 say the cars run about the same until you hammer the RS3 which on public roads is ill advised.  Anyway, I\\'d buy this car all over again and I don\\'t say anything out there that I like better.  If I did I\\'d buy it. Audi\\'s \"Baby S\" is a sweet little gem! I recently traded in my \\'14 Audi A6 Prestige (which was a great car) for a \\'15 S3 Prestige. There is certainly no doubt the S3 is a heck of a lot more fun to drive! Power delivery is excellent...although there is a small bit of turbo lag (esp. in regular \"D\" mode). I think a 7-sp DSG (like in the S4) would\\'ve been better.  Grip is outstanding and the car handles like it\\'s on rails. Braking is outstanding as well. I didn\\'t get the 19\" wheel and performance package because I live in Chicago where the road quality can be hell. Some of the cons for me are the lack of storage spaces (for sunglasses, etc), no memory seat settings, no built-in garage door opener, and no heated steering wheel.  Pocket Rocket I really love this car! Gorgeous looking inside and out. Probably my biggest impulse buy of all time. I wanted a Golf R but didn\\'t want to wait much longer. Got the Sepang Blue and everyone falls in love with the color.  It has all the options included, makes me nervous to see it practically drive itself. Of course the downsides. I really wish it had a manual trans. My drive gets boring real quick with the DSG. I\\'ll change as soon as one comes available. $50k car in 2015 with no Homelink, memory seats, data USB, boggles me. Interior storage also sucks. Glove box is a joke! All the items fall out when you open it. This message is for Audi but I DO encourage anyone to buy it. Its awesome!! THE best car I\\'ve ever driven Coming out of a 2010 Audi S4 I really didn\\'t know how I\\'d like downsizing my engine, but fuel economy is important to me so an S3 it was. I truly believe this car was made for me. It\\'s luxurious, it\\'s FAST, and it corners way better than my S4 ever did. The factory sound system (B&O) is second to none and the technology is very up-to-date. My days are actually a little brighter since this little car has entered my life. Audi has created a true masterpiece. 2016 Audi S3 is terrific! I consider myself a bona fide car nut this being my 38th car I\\'ve purchased. Just to correct one thing, it does have a USB port in the console under the armrest right next to the Audi connect port. For perspective, I\\'ve owned several BMW\\'s including 3 and 5 series, a Z4 3.0 and a slew of Benzes ranging from S-Class and G-Wagen to SLK and CLK430 and currently a mint CLS500. Two cars before this purchase, I owned a Porsche Cayman S for 4 years.  I\\'ve autocrossed, done track days and been a sports car fan since the late 50\\'s when I first saw Jim Kimberly in his Ferrari win a race.  Enough history.  I shopped the M235i and MB GLA45 AMG before making this buy. The S3 is a true entry level luxury rocket. It has all the tech anyone could want (and probably never use). Mine is a Prestige and has all the Driver\\'s assistance goodies, e.g. adaptive cruise, lane assist, blind spot monitoring, Presense braking, etc. These things are truly workable and disconnectable, great for interstate cruising. Now there is also Launch Control, along with 4 driving modes.  The sound when in Dynamic, or S drive is among the best I\\'ve heard.  And did I mention this thing really does fly. Audi says 0-60 in 4.7 sec. Motor Trend, C&D say 4.4 sec. One does have to know how to make it launch but it can be done in several ways only has one \"must\" step, disable the traction control. Shift to \"S\"or manual, disable the TC, step on the brake and floor the gas. It winds up to 4,000rpm. Take your foot off the brake and hold on.  The sports seat are very comfortable but lack electric adjustment! Don\\'t select the sports seats and you get electric. This isn\\'t a big issue unless a number of different drivers will use the car. Not a problem for me.  One other lux feature missing but available if ordered at the port is Homelink. It\\'s not on the option list but ask if it is a must have and it can be installed.  The B&O audio is terrific and entertainment sound options are numerous, Sirius, two of your own SD cards, BT stream through your phone or iPad, and it all works easily, automatically once you hook it up. The MMI system is as noted by many auto mags, easy to use and a really nice interface. On a closing note, neither the BMW or Benz interiors are nearly as nice and they don\\'t have all of Audi\\'s tech either... and comparably equipped (to the extent possible) they will cost $5-8,000 more.  Check their depreciation vs Audi\\'s 53% after 5 years.  In summary, if you\\'re in the market for a small luxury road rocket, you must give this car a look. As an update, I\\'ve now taken several road trips and have 8200+ miles on the odometer. The car continues to perform brilliantly with my only gripe being the inability to receive text messages unless iMessage is disabled and Twitter responses being very limited. Other than those 2 issues, I continue to believe I made the right decision purchasing Tis wonderful little sedan. Audi S3 After looking at various websites including Edmumds.com and using their buying service. I received a great deal on a 2016 Audi S3. The car is very well optioned and is a lot of fun to drive. It is very quick,  brakes superbly and very fun to drive. The car has a fantastic audio system,  Bang and Olephson. I would highly recommend this vehicle. Switched from BMW E90 - Zero Regrets I was nervous switching out of my aging (2007) BMW 335, being a long-time fan of BMWs, but after getting settled into my new S3, I\\'m a solid convert.  Handling and agility are tight and inspire confidence.  Acceleration is great, especially for the size of the engine; after taking it out for a spin, it took some effort to convince my friends and family that it was only a four-cylinder engine.  Shifting into higher gear at high revs sounds great, but engine noise when daily driving is calm and unobtrusive.The size is great for an urban area when you still want to fit people in the backseat - I\\'m 5\\'11\" and would be just fine sitting in the back on a decent road trip, though the back is not super roomy.  I prefer the smaller wheelbase over the BMW, as it only adds to the zippy feel of the car.  I compared the Golf R and the BMW M235, and was most impressed and got the best deal by far with the S3.  A must is the performance package (either the standard or the black optic) - the magnetic suspension is taut when on smooth freeways but welcomingly smooth when avoiding potholes in the city.  Extremely happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone in the market for a car that is sporty, luxurious, practical (relatively), and a great value.  You\\'ll love it. The little S3 that could I am really enjoying this car. I didn\\'t expect to enjoy it this much, but I do. I am coming from driving a 2012 E93 BMW M3 convertible, which was an excellent car in its own right. I expected to like the S3 after test driving it, but I could never imagine that I will like driving it more than the M3. Where the M3 felt powerful and fast the S3 feels quick and nimble. It is difficult to explain, but for me, driving the S3 is more relaxing and more controlled at the same time. M3 had better steering and better breaks even though S3\\'s steering and breaks are excellent too. I like the power delivery of the S3 better. In S mode there is no turbo/transmission lag and D mode is OK for everyday driving. Magnetic/Active damping makes the car more comfortable, it is stiff, but not nearly as harsh as the M3 was.One thing I haven\\'t figured out and having a slight trouble with is the Bluetooth connection. I am using it with Nexus 6P and streaming music gets muted very shortly after the car starts and Bluetooth gets connected. The music is still streamed but sound is not coming through the car or the phone. I need to turn off Bluetooth on my phone and turn it back on to fix it. After that all is well. Also, if I use Waze and Audible through Bluetooth, Waze interrupts the audiobook, but there is no sound coming from Waze, so I know that it was trying to tell me something, but not what it was trying to say. Best Audi besides the R8 Ultimate value if you want a fun luxurious all around performance car Couldn\\'t be happier with it Third update: Still love it! To be fair, however, if I was thinking about purchasing a new S3 today, I\\'d probably wait and compare it to the upcoming RS3 first, which my local Audi dealer has told me is due to arrive in November. That said, if it\\'s in as short supply as the BMW M2 continues to be - and negotiating any sort of discount off of MSRP would be unlikely - I\\'d likely stick with the S3, assuming I could successfully negotiate as strong a discount as last time around.Also, to correct an earlier remark I made about the car: its HomeLink system is apparently dealer-installed, and in my case it wasn\\'t listed separately on my invoice, for some reason (despite being charged extra for the dealer-installed tinted windows). Finally, just to note the one feature my car doesn\\'t have that I wish it did: memory-stored seat and steering wheel positions. Considering my 2003 BMW had them, as do numerous vehicles priced less than even a base-level S3, this seems like an admittedly unusual instance of Audi cutting corners.Updated review: 3/12/17Still couldn\\'t be happier with it! It\\'s still quite literally in a class of its own: it\\'s better than the CLA 45 despite being $15K cheaper, and BMW\\'s smallest sedan is a size up from the A3/S3 (comparable to an A4). Yes, it has most of the same underpinnings as the VW Golf R (minus the magnetic suspension, which is absolutely a must-have item), but VW still has the lingering question of how badly Dieselgate will ultimately impact resale values.Updated review: 9/10/16It\\'s now been four months since I bought my S3, and I remained as enamored with it as ever. Really, the *only* issue I have with the car is that it takes the A/C a while to get going, though note that I live in Texas and have to park it outside all day while at work. Still, the cold blast doesn\\'t kick in until about 15-20 seconds after I start it, or at least it does when the temp\\'s 95+ (which in my part of Texas is nearly every day between June and September). I also wanted to comment on remarks made in a few reviews posted since I wrote my original one. I\\'ve also had some curious issues with its Bluetooth system and my Nexus 6P phone, but much different ones than \"Barmoley\" apparently had. Rather than streaming music getting automatically muted, I\\'ve found that the car\\'s Bluetooth system automatically activates the last music app I used even if I DON\\'T want to listen to music (and don\\'t have *any* music apps open on my phone). The problem\\'s not limited to either that one phone or merely Android phones; I also have an iPhone, and the *exact* same thing happens with it as well. In both cases the only way to prevent it is to turn off the phones\\' Bluetooth connection altogether. That said, I\\'ve never had any problems listening to either Google Maps or Waze navigation directions through the stereo. Finally, I wanted to correct one error in Jim Glass\\'s otherwise-excellent review: the S3 does include HomeLink, and I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s standard equipment. It\\'s located in a slightly odd spot -- to the right of the driver-side visor, facing the left *window* -- but it\\'s definitely there and has three programmable buttons.Original review: 5/20/16As a longtime BMW aficionado, I had some doubts at first about switching my allegiance over to Audi, but after owning my S3 for a while, I have ZERO regrets. While BMW seems to have lost its way in recent years -- at least in terms of offering vehicles that truly *connect* with the road -- Audi has gone the opposite route, upping its game with its S-series of cars as BMWs have gotten increasingly bloated (in terms of price *and* literal bloat, as in curb weight). The S3 is a pocket rocket in the truest sense of the term, with razor-sharp handling and incredibly quick acceleration for a four-cylinder vehicle. BMW doesn\\'t even *make* a comparable vehicle; its closest competitor is the M2, which is only available as a (fairly impractical) coupe. The Benz CLA 45 is the S3\\'s only direct competition, and I found it to be subpar in nearly every way, most of all in terms of price: while I managed to negotiate a final purchase price of under $40K for my vehicle -- and that\\'s *with* a number of options, notably the Black Optic performance package -- most of the CLAs I saw had sticker prices north of $60K! (Much like BMW, Benz goes way overboard with its options pricing.) Even a Benz C450 AMG is difficult to procure for much under $50K (and a C63 obviously costs far more.)Furthermore, the S3 is the only one of the bunch that offers a measure of practicality to go with its sportiness. Good luck trying to fit anyone over 5\\'10\" or so in the back seat of a CLA; its roofline severely constricts rear head room. It has a surprisingly commodious trunk, with seats that fold down *far* more easily than those in any BMW I\\'ve ever owned. To be fair, rear leg room isn\\'t great, but it\\'s certainly better than that in a BMW 2-series (and only slightly less than that in a 3-series). 2016 Audi S3 - Low Coolant Warnings 6 months and 7100 miles.  Have had a low coolant warning appear twice.  Audi Bulletin advises that air gets into the system during production or when refilled during previous repairs.* Update.  Problem has not reoccurred.  At 17k and car is performing well.* Update.  Nearing the 30k mark and have not had any additional issues.  The S3 is still a fun to drive car that performs well.* Update.  Approach 40k.  The car has been solid.  Lots of power and fun to drive.  The B&O sound system makes the commute so much better as well.*Update. 48k+.  No issues.  Car is running great. Small package large performance Sold it and got a BMW 435. S3 is worth price I tried this while looking at the A3 and A4. While I am more partial to a smaller sedan and would have been happy with the A3, the S3 was worth the extra cost for me for the added acceleration and sport performance. Driving the S3 versus A3 the driving experience itself is definitely different the extra horsepower is a definite rush while driving the S3. If you are a fan of a little \"vroom vroom\" while driving you will love this car. Update 11-2017 Still loving this car took it in for its 25,000 mile service and still going strong. After 18 months of ownership... I waited for the motor to be fully broken in before I measured its performance, but after 18 months of ownership I can honestly say this S3 looks very “nice” but doesn’t have the acceleration (or reliability) I was hoping for.  As well, the magnetic ride is a farce, I get a “banging” noise on the rear passenger sides strut, which bother my passengers as well as me. The dealership says “they don’t hear anything, and this noise is normal” but other forum posters say it’s not normal, as they are in the same predicament... Looks like I should have accepted the legal route after all. I think I’m going have to look at a Lexus for my next purchase. Loving every minute Get it, You wont regret it!! An outstanding sports car My local Audi dealer recently took in a 2102 TT RS, a car that I had been interested in for some time, but had never seen. After driving it I was very impressed, and traded my 2011 Corvette Grand Sport for the RS immediately. The RS has acceleration equal to the Corvette\\'s up to about 80 mph, is far more maneuverable, and much more exciting to drive. It probably would not be at its best on long road trips however, since the ride is somewhat stiff and the exhaust noise can be bothersome. I have also owned a Porsche Cayman S in the recent past, and the Audi is superior to that car in nearly every respect. Any prospective Cayman buyer should give the Audi serious consideration. However, after six months of ownership, the check engine light came on. Due to the rarity of the vehicle and its sophisticated engine, it took two weeks for my dealer to find and fix the problem. I decided that I didn\\'t want a car that had the potential to cause me further problems, so I traded it for a Porsche Boxster. This car blew me away! I walked into an Audi dealership to test drive the S5 and the dealership was the only one in San Diego to have a TT RS in stock.I test drove it and was absolutely blown away!The clutch and transmission are PERFECT.The clutch is perfectly weighted, releases at the top of the movement, and the 6-speed transmission was snickety with the perfect size shift lever.The engine was insanely quick and the car felt lighter than the M3 and C63 because it is.The interior was much nicer than the BMW M3 and Mercedes C63 AMG.But once I experienced the performance the interior was an afterthought. I ordered the TT RS the same day after test driving other cars for 2 years.It is that good! Warp factor 10, Mr. Sulu! More than a year ago I began to see articles in the automotive press about a new version of the TT RS. I continued to follow reports about that car, and, when it began to appear in this country, I started to look for one. It took about five weeks to find one, but yesterday, 3-13-18, I took delivery of TT RS VIN WUACSAFVXJ1902122. I bought from Cary Audi in NC, and received excellent service from them, especially from the salesman, Jonathan Christie.I am very pleased with my new car. I had been driving a 2017 Porsche Cayman S, and I think that the RS is superior in nearly every respect. My only reservation is the exterior styling. My car is white, and it looks somewhat like an angry refrigerator. However, one spends most of one’s time inside the car, not outside looking at it. There is no better interior than that of an Audi, both from ergonomic and styling points of view.The car that turned me against my Cayman was the 2018 S3 that I bought last November. I eventually found that I preferred driving that car to driving my Porsche, for a variety of reasons.This is a superb car, one of the best I have owned. It is remarkable in every respect. Driving it is addictive.<br> Great Manual Crazy Fast Car  Worked fine until I took it in for its 5000 mile servcing. Power, road handling and comfort all 5 stars !For dependability, 1 star.Dealer Visit 1 - 5000 mile servicing. Received it back with an issue that wasn\\'t there before. A lack of acceleration in the lower RPM range.Dealer Visit 2 - Shop foreman read from the on-board computer so that the information may be sent off to a specialists. Now the auto has a new issue.\"DO NO EXCEED 4k RPM\" while traveling 10-25 mph while releasing the clutch with no accelerator ~2k RPM.Dealer Visit 3 - High Pressure fuel pump was replaced, the car is ready for pick up. The same \"DO NOT EXCEED 4K RPM\" occurred twice that same day.Dealer visit 4 - Handed over video of the issue + my car 1 in a 1000 I pulled the trigger a few weeks ago and purchased a new blue 2013 TTRS (only 1000 built in 2012/13).Having owned a G35 and BMW 335i, the TTRS is by far the best \"sports\" car of the three. They are not even close to the same class. Every performance characteristic is better with the TTRS. A closer comparison would be a 911, but there is a bit more luxury feel to the TTRS. The 911 handles a bit better, but you give up ride comfort. Don\\'t get me wrong though, the handling is world class. Corvettes come even close to the handling. For all you guys who think you cannot fit a car seat in the back, you are wrong! My 7 year old and3 year old ride in the back when I take them to school.  Stick or flick shifting fun The car is a great car it is a little pricey compared to the competitors. It has the Audi outstanding quality and build my only complaint with the car is I WANT MY STICK BACK!  The paddle shifter is outstanding and yes a little faster than me lol but I still enjoy driving a car. That is my only complaint other than that A+. Not all sports cars are made for summer. In reference to the title. I am one that doesn\\'t really believe in stowing a car for the winter. Especially an Audi TTS Quattro. I live near Toronto, Canada and my business is downtown Toronto. Yes we come from the land of the ice and snow 4 to 5 months of the year. The TTS is a sports car made for this weather. In November off came the 19\" summers and on went the 18\" winters. There are not many vehicles I can think of that handle the ice and snow better. The 4 cylinder Turbo is awesome on fuel. The option of automatic or paddle shifters makes for an easy commute in traffic and a quick shift into sport manual mode and we have lots of shifting fun. This car is fast and handles very very well. A TTS finally worthy of Sports Car status Incredible levels of style, refinement, and performance at this price point. 6 speed double clutch offers rapid shifting and convenient \"rev matching\" in sport mode. Light weight and fun to throw into corners, drives like a luxury go-kart. Google Earth is simply amazing, navigation/controls took me about a week to master, now seem very intuitive and make other cars feel dated. Magnetic ride suspension gives the car a near luxury ride in Comfort mode for longer drives. I feel a better value than Cayman, which prices out $10K - $15K more with similar equipment. Back seats for kids only, fold flat for surprising amount of room (yes, the golf clubs fit easily). Give it a look when shopping M2, M4\\'s and Porsche. Has truly evolved from a fun \"sporty\" coupe to true sports car with daily driver comforts and cutting edge technology. Ready for the track... This coupe has been a pure joy to own, so far* (just sold an older Audi sports car, so well aware of the potential future service). She\\'s nimble on windy roads with minimal body roll, and is quite sure-footed in snow, (Pirelli snow tires; though one does need to avoid sudden jolts, with this many horses). The noted 0-60 speed has prob been underestimated. Acceleration is smooth throughout the power band, with only a hint of initial turbo lag. My only complaint, if there is one, is lack of standard transmission. The paddle shifters just aren\\'t the same, but in reality the automatic mode (in Sport setting) shifts at all the proper points. Love that the dynamic mode shifts this car to rear-wheel bias with the touch of a button/also impacts cornering and these differences are noticeable to the driver. Plus, suspension changes can be immediately felt to dampen a rough road, if needed. There\\'s always a glitch Love everything about my 2017 TTS--except an o -ring on the pressurized oil line to the turbo charger was leaking from day 1. I got a warning at just over 200mi. Was promptly fixed, but my driveway is a mess with oil stains! Not wat to expect from a $60,000 vehicle. Love this car! why would a corporation build such a beautiful, well performing machine and equip it with such cheap tires. after 12k km I could not hear the radio anymore, the tires were so noisy. I am 68 years old and drive like a 68 years old should, carefully and at the speed limit. not even a year and I have to spend a fortune on new tires! don\\'t give me the high performance BS because michelins will last longer. so why not put those on at the factory? cheap, cheapUp-date (a year later)Thanks to the dealer\\'s (Mark Motors of Ottawa) goodwill, I was given a deal, 4 for the price of 3 wholesale, Michelin and I have been happy ever since. No help from Audi corp however (just a few \\'\\'so sorry\\'\\' emails). BUT, still absolutely love that TT!Working on my third set of tires @ 50,000kilometres. Got a good deal again from dealer: Yokohamas all season. supposed to last longer. Turning heads and thumbs up Ive had my TTS since 2013. I feel it is so unique. I am one of the few that owns one here in my city. I love how rare this car is. Everywhere I go people give me the thumbs up or ask me about it. I love its look and the 19\" wheels are what really catch the eye. This car is quick and really gets going in the mid rpm\\'s. This is just one sexy machine. TTS Roadster 2010 - owned for 2 months A perfect sport car if living in Canada, 7 months of winter per year and the Quattro makes sense if driving daily tens of kilometers. My son and me tested for at least one year several TT and TTS 2009 models and finally we decided for the TTS Roadster 2010. We signed the deal same day after the last test drive. We own the car for 2 months already, 4400 km so far. The car is a dream to drive, performs amazingly in the city or on the highway, it is impossible not to get noticed while driving this car. I took the car with my wife for a long weekend 1600 km round trip.  Excellent ride with the top down, less noise in the cockpit when the screen is elevated and almost no noise when windows are up This car is ... Great this car is so much fun for my family. My kids love this car and the way it handles is a dream i would recommend this car for anyone, anyone that has a lot of money that is, you see this car is like super expensive and there is no way someone that doesn\\'t get paid a lot can afford it so unless you are financially stable don\\'t get this car trust me. But if you make lots of money go for it! :) TTS I simply love this car, I only had it for a few months and it\\'s given me much more than I asked for. It\\'s such a smooth ride. I thought this vehicle was worth way more than 50g. Can\\'t go wrong with the TTS!!! I researched the TTS for a various long months before making the decision to go test drive it reading articles on the web and asking man Audi owners about their experience with the brand. I loved the car from the minute I drove it out of the dealer but it took me a good month to explore the full potential of it. A few weeks after the purchase the dealer had to change a faulty temperature sensor in the transmission. Since then, there\\'s nothing wrong that I could say about it. The handling is outstanding, the 4 wheel-drive makes it glide on winding roads. The acceleration and take off feel like flying a rocket. Driving a TTS is a real pleasure. The TTS will not let you down, period. The Lower Cost Cayman S This is Audi\\'s version of a Porsche!  Probably the Cayman S is the closest competitor in my view in terms of performance.  The Audi brings a fantastic quattro AWD system and rear seats for people under 5\\' tall (and I do mean UNDER 5\\' tall).  Audi has been making uber-reliable cars lately, and this one is no exception.  In fact, the only problem I\\'ve had is with the dorky blind spot monitor sensors.   I recommend sticking with the OEM 19\" or after-market 18 or 19\" wheels.  The 20\" look great, and are high quality wheels, but will give you a harsher ride.   I love this car.  A true sports car. Holy Cow is it fast!!!!!! be ready to pay close to sticker or sticker however every dime is worth an exhilarating drive and ride. Very fast and responsive in Sport mode! Excellent for an enthusiast Disclaimer, I purchased a TTS but this information is still pertinent to a TT buyer(Dynamics) With the recent refresh, Audi brings the TT more inline with its yet to be released R8 big brother. The new IE8888 2.0 liter turbo four cylinder works beautifully with the S-tronic transmission (the only one available in the U.S.). There is just a bit of turbo lag below 2500 rpm, but once in the boost power is of no concern at all. The acceleration is more than enough for the average driver, and at freeway speeds even the base TT passes other cars with ease (but be sure to let the S-tronic downshift a couple gears first). With Audi\\'s Quattro system, grip in poor conditions is not a problem if you\\'re being reasonable (note: I live in a very snowy area of the U.S.) but I have gotten it to intentionally slide at low speeds. In dry conditions you\\'d have to be quite reckless to get this thing to lose grip, but it is manageable when the rear steps out of line. It handles well, but, (and this is a critique of all Audis I\\'ve experienced) the steering is pretty numb and doesn\\'t provide much in the way of feedback on the road surface. The steering is, however, well weighted and is direct enough that I barely even need to think about where I want the car to go. The suspension is on the firmer side but it isn\\'t harsh or jarring at all on decent road surfaces, body roll through corners is negligible and the chassis feels rock solid. Fuel economy is also better than advertised in my car, at freeway speeds I have achieved 29 mpg (US cycle) when I was told I should be getting 27.5 mpg or less(Technology) The Virtual Cockpit is undoubtedly the star of the Interior. It does take some time to get used to controlling almost  everything through the steering wheel, but once acclimated it is quite intuitive and easy to use, even on the move. Safety isn\\'t too much of a concern since the system is mounted very close to eye level (also of note I\\'m only 5\\'8\" or 172 cm) but don\\'t be too distracted by it. Also, the screen provides a good enough viewing angle to allow a passenger to use the entertainment system without struggle, but they can change the layout of the guages if they go into a submenu. The one critique that I have for the Virtual Cockpit is that the control buttons are somewhat small even with my diminutive hands and I could easily see somebody with larger or gloved hands struggle with the steering wheel mounted controls. This is remedied with a more conventional MMI control set up intended mostly for passengers, but it is somewhat disappointing given that it\\'s a selling point of this car. I also have the technology package and B&O sound system, the first out of necessity and the later out of desire. The parking sensors and rearview camera are a must for this car as judging distances can be somewhat tough. The blind spot monitor is also a must have option because the C-pillar is simply massive and obtrusive in everyday driving. I could foresee an instance where a driver cannot see a motorcyclist behind them due to the size of the C-pillar, and backing out of parking spaced makes me nervous. My only real complaint about the technology is that active cruise control or front collision prevention isn\\'t even offered. Of note, I believe this is offered in Europe but not North America for some reason. (Interior) Audi is known for their excellent interiors and this is no exception. I opted for the sports seats and the leather quality is superb, as is the comfort they provide. It is quite easy to make a long journey in this car without being fatigued or uncomfortable. The dashboard is made of a pretty high quality soft touch material that lends itself well to the aesthetic of the rest of the interior. The vent mounted HVAC controls are also pretty intuitive and in my opinion look stylish and futuristic. As for the rear seats, they really are an afterthought. They are basically reserved for children and the most petite of adults, although I have gotten people of 5\\'5\" in the back for short periods, but they did complain about the space. In my experience they serve better as an extra storage space but they do have child seat mounts. One additional note, ingress and egress are difficult in this car not only by the long doors typical of coupes, but also by the wider side skirts and fairly wide door sill. Overall the interior is a great place to be as long as you do not plan on having more than one other passenger for long periods of time. (Storage) Despite its small size the TT actually impresses in the amount of storage it offers. There are numerous small cubbies in the main cabin and the trunk is surprisingly large, particularly when the seats are folded down. There is also a full size spare tire too(conclusion) This is a fun small high tech sports car that one can easily live with every day and enjoy. If you live in a colder climate and can justify having microscopic rear seats, this is a great all-weather sports coupe Awesome Vehicle I recently purchased my 2009 TTS convertible and could not be happier. The exterior look is a unique combination of sophistication and a fun roadster (I get a lot of head turns driving it).  The interior design is not only smartly laid out but the quality is obviously of the highest level.  It has great acceleration and a very smooth ride and handling at high speeds. While some may say the AWD feature (which is great for northern weather) may detract from the rear wheel drive sensation of speed and acceleration, I have not noticed this.  Overall, I cannot find a bad thing to say about this car.  It truly is a winner.    Happy If you\\'re looking for an car that will turn heads then this is your car. I think in the Audi family r8s, s5s, ttrss and ttss turn heads. I would like to say rs6 and rs4 but you need to be an Audi fan to know what there about. I purchased our new car and instantly feel in love coming from an 2001 a4 then an 2006 a4 2l tfsi quattro, we are slowing working our way up. Our car is polar orange and its stunning. Manual gear box and upgraded leather package. New Zealand roads are perfect for these cars as they are mostly hilly and winding roads. You feel feel safe when driving them in all conditions. Hopefully one day we will move into an r8 or similar. Audi rocks !  Upgraded to this from the original MK1... ... and it definitely delivers.  I knew I was in trouble when I test drove it at the dealer. Wasn\\'t looking to buy that day, but after the drive I knew I was taking it home. I\\'ve had it for almost a year now and very happy with my choice.  The car corners and handles with supreme confidence. It\\'s unbelievable coming from a 2001 TT - what I can do with this car!  Coming from a manual I was a little skeptical of DSG. But the ability to paddle shift (key when engaging in spirited driving), the smoothness and quickness of DSG sold me pretty quickly.  Very rare to see the a TTS too. I\\'ve only seen one other in the Bay Area.   Very Pleased, Came From Porsche, BMW, MB What a great vehicle.  Replaced a Lotus Exige which I mistakenly thought I could manage as a daily driver.  The Exige is brilliant but was simply a car to be endured to be enjoyed.  What the TTS loses to outright track performance from the Lotus it more than makes up with overall reliability, fit & finish, & comfort. I\\'ve had an R32 which the Audi is essentially a sexier, more powerful & luxurious, version.  Some alternatives are faster, sharper, cheaper, etc.  But, the Audi TTS is a brilliant fast, four-season sports car that can coddle you in luxury, large cargo area, and is a modern classic.  Price & Performance alternatives: BMW 135, 370Z.  STI/Evo are decent near-luxury considerations wow... wow..that\\'s what anybody I give a ride to in the TTS says after taking it for a spin.  No one believes that its a \"4 banger\".  Drove the 370Z, G37, M3, Cayman, Corvette, WRX, etc.  Nothing compares to the TTS.  this is now a real machine.    I\\'m glad Audi does not advertise in the mainstream market and keeps these gems to true car enthusiasts My 2014 Audi TTS I traded in my 2008 Corvette C6 for this Audi TTS, so far it is a better car.It\\'s not as quick as the Corvette, but still pretty quick.It handles and sticks to the road much better than the Corvette. I really like the transmission, the Corvette was a 6 speed stick, the TTS is a 6 speed dual clutch auto, it shifts really quick, both up and down, the Corvette transmission wasn\\'t even close.The car itself seems very solid and rides well when not in the sport ride mode, the sport mode has very little damping.So far I would recommend the Audi TTS. I now have 16,000 miles on it, no problems so far.  But, the orginal Toyo tires wore out in 12,000, I put on Michlin Pilot Super Sports, they are wearing better and hold on in the corners better than the Toyos.'"
